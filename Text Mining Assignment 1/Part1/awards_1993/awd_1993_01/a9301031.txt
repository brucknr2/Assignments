Abstract    :
                Research continues on the development of efficient  algorithms  for
              computational problems arising in several application areas,  including
              Optimization, Artificial Intelligence, Logic Databases,  Distributed 
              Decision-Making, Testing, Parallel Computation, and  Mathematical Economics, as
               well as on the foundations of  Complexity Theory.   This project focuses on:
              (1) the  approximability of several optimization problems, in the light of
              recent  important advances in this area; (2)  work on the competitive analysis 
              of on-line algorithms  along three lines, using competitive analysis as a 
              yardstick for  measuring the performance of distributed decision-making 
              algorithms, as well as the value of information and  communication; applying
              the  methodology to problems motivated by  parallel compilers; and trying to
              resolve  the K-server  conjecture; (3) work on several problems related to the 
              efficient  implementation of logic database queries, as well as in further 
              developing a computational theory of rapid informal reasoning  based on model 
              selection; (4) the study of certain complexity classes that appear to lie 
              strictly between P and NP, capturing limited non determinism and  total 
              functions; (5) the use of computational complexity as a `scientific  metaphor`
              for capturing bounded rationality in Mathematical  Economics; looking  from the
              algorithmic point of view at some key problems in the Theory of Games  and that
              of Implementation; and (6) work on some interesting computational  problems
              related  to testing large distributed systems.
