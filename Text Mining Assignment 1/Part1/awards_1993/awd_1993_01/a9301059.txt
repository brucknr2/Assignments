Abstract    :
              This a renewal award to support research                                       
              previously supported under NSF Grant No. 89-                                   
              18935 in which the investigator studied the                                    
              deterioration of marble when subjected to                                      
              sulfurous and nitrogenous atmospheric                                          
              pollutants, both categories of which are                                       
              produced during the combustion of fossil                                       
              fuels.  The objective of this renewal project                                  
              is to extend the studies of deterioration to                                   
              dolomites and limestones, building materials                                   
              that are much more  porous than marble.                                        
                                                                                             
              This research is likely to lead to a better                                    
              understanding than now exists of the role                                      
              played by air pollutants in accelerating the                                   
              deterioration of materials and structures                                      
              that are exposed to the pollutants.  This                                      
              knowledge may be applied to engineering                                        
              design of structures to minimize damage from                                   
              air pollutants and to establish the economic                                   
              value of pollution abatement measures in                                       
              comparison with the structural deterioration                                   
              to pollutant exposures.//
