Abstract    :
                   Several problems in probability theory are to be studied.                 
              The first three concern models which are closely related to                    
              statistical physics, while the last one deals with the more                    
              traditional topic of sums of independent, identically distributed              
              random variables.  Particular problems include finding bounds on               
              the radius of a stochastic growth model, investigating some                    
              properties of random resistor networks, and studying the                       
              asymptotic shape of first and last passage percolation.                        
                   This research will investigate some probabilistic models                  
              inspired by statistical physics.  These include critical                       
              phenomena in percolation theory, diffusion limited aggregation ,               
              and first-passage percolation.  In addition, the investigator                  
              will also look at criteria for divergence of sums of independent,              
              identically distributed random variables from which some large                 
              summands have been removed.
