Abstract    :
                   This research is concerned with conformal field theory and                
              specifically with the study of vertex operator algebras.  The                  
              principal investigator will study the following topics: vertex                 
              category theory; reconstruction of vertex operator algebras from               
              vertex tensor categories; modular vertex tensor categories;                    
              vertex groups and vertex operator algebras; vertex groups and                  
              integrable systems; geometric construction of the Monster;                     
              cohomology theory for vertex operator algebras; and vertex                     
              manifolds.                                                                     
                   Conformal field theory is an important physical theory                    
              describing both two-dimensional critical phenomena in condensed                
              matter physics and classical motions of strings in string theory.              
              Besides its importance in physics, the beautiful and rich                      
              mathematical structure of conformal field theory also has                      
              interested many mathematicians.  New relations between different               
              branches of mathematics, such as representations of                            
              infinite-dimensional Lie algebras and groups, Riemann surfaces                 
              and algebraic curves, the Monster sporadic group, modular                      
              functions and modular forms, elliptic genera, and knot theory, is              
              revealed in the study of conformal field theory.  It is believed               
              that the study of the mathematics involved in conformal field                  
              theory will lead to new mathematical structures which will be                  
              important both in mathematics and theoretical physics.
