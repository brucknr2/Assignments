Abstract    :
              Berger  9301438    The authors propose to study periods of known or suspected
              rapid  climate change at an annual resolution, using laminated sediments from 
              Santa Barbara Basin off Southern California. Times of interest include  the
              "Medieval Warm Period" (950-1350 A.D.), the climatic optimum (5000  and 8000
              years B.P.), the deglacial period and the full glacial. Cores  will be scanned
              by Xradiography to set up a chronology and identify  levels of interest; for
              each level a section representing a few decades  will then be sampled with
              annual resolution. The occurrence of El Ni~io  intervals, intensity of
              upwelling and levels of primary production, and  regional precipitation will be
              inferred from temperature-dependent  alkenones, stable carbon isotopes and
              nitrogen, abundance and taxonomy  of phytoplankton fossils, and varve
              thickness.
