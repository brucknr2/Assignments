Abstract    :
              9301022  Stahara  The specific modules of our Progressive Modular Model (PMM) to
              be  developed include a coupled solar wind-magnetosheath-magnetosphere  module
              that incorporates: (1) several recently-developed MHD  computational models for
              predicting the global solar wind-  magnetosheath plasma flow past the
              terrestrial magnetosphere and,  (2) a powerful new computational magnetospheric
              boundary element  model that is capable of determining the shape and location
              of the  first-order, force-balanced magnetopause surface that consistently 
              couples the magnetosheath and magnetospheric plasma and magnetic  fields.  Such
              a capability is crucial to beginning a rational study  of the transport process
              associated with entry of solar wind mass,  momentum, energy and magnetic and
              electric fluxes into the  magnetosphere.  The proposed model represents an
              important first  step in trying to explore and quantify to what form the
              microscopic  transport processes, which are not determinable by MHD theory, 
              locally alter the ideal MHD plasma and field boundary conditions at  the
              magnetospause to set the rates and the overall physics of the  processes that
              couple the magnetosheath plasma and magnetic fields  to the magnetosphere.  The
              model achieves this by providing the  capability for determining the coupled
              global mangetosheath-  magnetospheric solutions in which boundary-normal
              magnetic field  and plasma velocity components are systematically imposed
              locally  at the mangetopause and then examining: (1) how both the local and 
              global magnetosheath and mangetospheric solutions on either side of  the
              magnetopause change, (2) how these effects vary with changing  upstream solar
              wind conditions and, (3) how the magnetosphere  responds globally to these
              variations.  ***
