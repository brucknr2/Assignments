Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Theoretical Studies and Interstellar Matter.                                   
                                                                                             
              Dr. Dalgarno will direct theoretical studies of photon-dominated               
              regions of interstellar matter, incorporating the photodestruction             
              of molecular ions.  The ionization structure of such regions will              
              be calculated.  The photodissociation of molecular nitrogen will               
              be included in a study of nitrogen chemistry.  Regions subjected               
              to intense X-ray fluxes will be investigated, and the infrared                 
              response of molecular hydrogen will be obtained.  The thermal and              
              chemical structure of supernova remnant SN 1987A will be                       
              investigated.  Calculations of charge transfer of ionized helium               
              will be performed.
