Abstract    :
                   The primary objectives of this research are (1) to establish              
              the scientific basis for gas-assisted injection molding, (2) to                
              develop an engineering tool for characterizing the process, and                
              (3) to improve the process technology with computer simulation,                
              modern sensors, and design guidelines.  The Phase I research proved            
              the technical feasibility of simulating the mold-filling dynamics.             
              It also demonstrated the various merits of computer-aided                      
              engineering (CAE) which enhance engineers' capability in handling              
              all aspects of the process.                                                    
                   In the Phase II research, both experimental and computational             
              work are conducted to further the basic understanding of the                   
              process and integrated filling/holding/cooling/part-performance                
              analysis.  Collaboration with industry and universities is                     
              emphasized to jointly verify the analysis and consolidate                      
              engineering know-how.  Successful completion of this research                  
              enhances competitiveness of the nation's polymer-processing                    
              industry by fully utilizing the new process with CAE.
