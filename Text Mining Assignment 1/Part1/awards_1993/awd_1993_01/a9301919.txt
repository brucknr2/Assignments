Abstract    :
              Interferometrics proposes to conduct a Phase II SBIR                           
              research effort to implement the design of a portable                          
              satellite communications terminal that was created                             
              during Phase I.  The proposed terminal will provide                            
              autonomous                                                                     
              digital communications in polar regions using existing store                   
              and-forward digital packet radio satellite in high                             
              inclination low Earth orbit.  The principal goal of this                       
              effort is to demonstrate the use of an ultra-compact                           
              terminal which would work satisfactorily in the polar                          
              environment and be useful for both the NSF and commercial                      
              satellite communications customers.  Our objective is to                       
              design, construct and evaluate an engineering development                      
              model that will reduce significantly the size, weight,                         
              power, and cost of the terminal, while improving its overall                   
              performance, reliability, and ease of use.                                     
                                                                                             
              Key features of the proposed terminal design are:  (1) use                     
              of an Integrated Communications Processor to eliminate the                     
              Terminal Node Controller hardware, reduce the terminal's                       
              power requirement, and permit interconnections to a personal                   
              computer, GPS receiver, and/or research instrumentation; (2)                   
              an antenna system optimized for communicating with                             
              microsatellites and tailored to the local RF environment;                      
              and (3) integration with an Internet gateway to create an                      
              autonomous, transparent satellite radio link between                           
              Internet sites.
