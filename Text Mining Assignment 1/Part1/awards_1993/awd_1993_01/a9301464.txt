Abstract    :
              9301464 Hernried A strategy for the active control of civil engineering
              structures, particularly cable supported bridge structures, is planned.  The
              control algorithm incorporates nonlinearities and uncertainties that may exist
              in the structural model.  The control strategy is to be implemented in a
              decentralized manner.  Control forces are generated for and sensor information
              obtained from subsystems of the structure.  Analytical studies will be
              performed using the nonlinear decentralized control strategy on several example
              cable supported bridge structures subjected to free vibration, harmonic, and
              earthquake excitation.  Structural nonlinearities are expected to be primarily
              geometric due to the possibly large motions of the bridge deck and supporting
              cables.  Both the uncontrolled and controlled response will be determined.  An
              iterative scheme will be employed to determine optimum sensor locations. 
              Experimental studies will be performed to verify the proposed methodology and
              will serve as a comparison to the analytical simulations. ***
