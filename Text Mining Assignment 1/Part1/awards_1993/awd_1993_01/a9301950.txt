Abstract    :
              9301950     KNAP    This effort will continue the U.S. JGOFS Bermuda Atlantic
              Time-  series Study (BATS) for a second five year period. This station, 
              approximately 75 km southeast of Bermuda, has been occupied for 67  cruises in
              the 49 months since sampling began in October 1988.  These cruises included 49
              core cruises where the entire suite of  measurements is conducted, 13 spring
              bloom and 5 validation cruises  to look for island effects and to estimate the
              extent of spatial  variability in this region.  The results of these cruises
              have been  distributed to the oceanographic community in data reports and 
              peer-reviewed publications.  The aim of this project is to continue  the same
              measurement and protocol scheme in order to fulfill the  requirements of a US
              JGOFS time-series station.  The only  differences for the next few years is to
              supplement the program by  core measurements of dissolved organic carbon, the
              addition of pCO2  measurements and the upgrading of capabilities for data
              validation  and distribution.  The understanding and platform opportunities 
              created by this Station over past 4 years has provided a rich  infrastructure
              in which individual research projects are also  imbedded. With another 5 years
              of support the processes controlling  the time-varying flux of carbon and
              associated biogenic elements in  the ocean will be further elucidated.
