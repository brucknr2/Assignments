Abstract    :
              9301608  Mann  The Solomon Islands is the only place on Earth where it is 
              possible to examine the tectonic effects of Mio-Pliocene  shallow subduction of
              one of the world's largest and  thickest oceanic plateaus. This is a US-Japan
              cooperative  program to map crustal and perhaps upper mantle structures  in the
              Solomon Islands convergent zone. The primary  objective of the multi-channel
              seismic study is to test two  models for the formation of the Malaita
              anticlinorium-the  deformed wedge of Cretaceous-Cenozoic pelagic limestone, 
              basalt, and clastic rocks that most previous workers agree  to be an emergent
              part of the Ontong Java Plateau. ***
