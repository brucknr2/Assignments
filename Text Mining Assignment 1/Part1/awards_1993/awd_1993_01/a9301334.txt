Abstract    :
              FREW  9301334      Surface-active organic matter produced by marine
              phytoplankton is  known to reduce the exchange of gases at the air-water
              interface.  Surfactants have a first-order effect on the gas transfer velocity-
               wind speed relationship up to moderate wind speeds and the mean  square wave
              slope offers a parameterization of transfer velocity Kw  at different wind
              speeds and surface viscoelastic conditions. The  objective in this continuing
              research is to further refine this  parameterization for gas exchange in the
              presence of natural  surfactants and to use surfactants as a tool to examine
              the role of  small-scale waves and turbulence as agents affecting gas exchange.
                New techniques for characterizing 3-dimensional wave spectra and  for
              measurement of viscoelastic damping will be applied to  measurements of Kw in
              two circular wind-wave tanks of different  scales.  A range of surface-active
              compounds, including synthetic  and natural surfactants, which yield films with
              different elastic  and viscous contributions to the dynamic surface
              viscoelasticity  will be used to modify the wave field during measurements of
              Kw and  the three-dimensional wave spectra and gas transfer and to 
              discriminate between mechanisms involving viscoelastic (marangoni)  damping of
              either small scale wave or near-surface turbulence.  The  research is relevant
              to models of upper ocean biogeochemical  processes in which gas exchange is an
              important component.
