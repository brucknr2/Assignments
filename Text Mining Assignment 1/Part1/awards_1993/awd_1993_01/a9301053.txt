Abstract    :
                   This award supports work on several projects in commutative               
              algebra especially concentrating on two topics: the theory of tight            
              closure and big Cohen-Macaulay algebras, and the existence of                  
              uniform bounds in noetherian rings.  The first topic involves a                
              continuing joint effort with Melvin Hochster.  The principal                   
              investigator and Hochster have been developing the theory of tight             
              closure over the last six years and plan on continuing this work.              
              The latter topic is centered around issues arising in the proof of             
              the uniform Artin-Rees property.  The principal investigator would             
              also like to continue work on several other topics, notably local              
              cohomology, Rees algebras, computer algebra, and general hyperplane            
              sections of algebraic varieties.                                               
                   This is reasearch in the field of algebraic geometry, one of              
              the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which has had a                
              revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century.  In its                   
              origins, it treated figures that could be defined in the plane by              
              the simplest equations, namely polynomials.  Nowadays the field                
              makes use of methods not only from algebra, but from analysis and              
              topology, and conversely is finding application in those fields as             
              well as in theoretical computer science and robotics.
