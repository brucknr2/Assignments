Abstract    :
              9301387  Nowak  There is a considerable degree of uncertainty involved in truck 
              loads.  The control systems developed in this study includes  passive and
              active approaches.  Passive control will include short-  term and long-term
              monitoring of truck loads: in particular,  extreme truck loads, fatigue load
              spectra, simultaneous occurrence  of trucks, travel patterns and site specific
              difference in order to  improve highway management strategies.  Field
              measurement will be  performed using the data acquisition systems available to
              the  project team.  Special computer procedures will be developed for  the
              signal analysis.  The developed system will perform two  functions: measurement
              of truck loads (axle loads, spacing,  multiple presence) and evaluation of the
              structural performance  (diagnostics).  Active control will include response to
              occurrence  of critical and undesirable events, as for example occurrence of an
               overloaded truck.  Using existing lines of communication on  selected bridges
              (owned by State DOT), the results will be  transferred to the State DOT office
              with the request for action  (further inspection, lane closure or bridge
              closure).
