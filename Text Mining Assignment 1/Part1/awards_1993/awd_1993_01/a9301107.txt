Abstract    :
              9301107  Hanson       High performance computing is essential for managing
              massive  computational and memory demands in optimal control of large  scale
              applications, such as aerospace, structures, resources,  economics and
              robotics.  Implementation of advanced computational  techniques, such as
              parellelization, matrization (including  vectorization), graphical
              visualization and problem mapping make  possible the solution of larger
              dimensional problems.  Our  research objective is to develop fast algorithms
              for the optimal  feedback control of general continuous time nonlinear
              stochastic  dynamical systems.  These systems include perturbations by both 
              Gaussian and distributed Poisson white noise.  Advanced  computational
              treatment of these systems, especially with Poisson  noise, is a particularly
              unique feature of this proposal.  The  algorithms are being testing on
              multi-state resource models, but  are applicable to a wide variety of
              applications.  The numerical  approach directly treats the partial differential
              equation of  stochastic programming.  New algorithms, such as finite element, 
              will be developed to alleviate both memory and computationally  intensive
              demands from the "curse of dimensionality".  Purely  parallel methods are being
              developed for scalable, massively  parallel and massive memory supercomputers,
              including new  generation "ultracomputers".  The development of graphical 
              visualization tools is also essential for analyzing massive  amounts of output
              in many dimensions.  There are also several  related problems as well.  ***
