Abstract    :
              Three-dimensional modeling of industrial metal forming processes               
              using an Eulerian reference frame will be performed.  Common                   
              processes such as rolling, drawing, and extrusion will be                      
              evaluated.  These processes all involve a high degree of                       
              mechanical-thermal-material coupling.  A model which accounts for              
              this coupling and an algorithm for handling this coupling is being             
              developed.  A finite deformation theory for the elastic-plastic                
              kinematics must be used to handle the large deformations being                 
              considered.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              The planning stage of this project, the model, algorithm, and code             
              development will be handled in collaboration with colleagues at                
              Rensselaer and Alcoa Laboratories.
