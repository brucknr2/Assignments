Abstract    :
                  9301829  Goodman  This research project will develop a three-dimensional
              mathematical  model to analyze the structural performance of a typical 
              manufactured house subjected to extreme  winds and other lateral  loads.  The
              math model will be verified by a full scale experiment  of a generic
              manufactured house.
