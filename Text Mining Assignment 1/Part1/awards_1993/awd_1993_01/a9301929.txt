Abstract    :
                   This award is concerned with the representation theory and                
              cohomology of finite groups over fields of prime characteristic.               
              Of particular interest are the homological properties of                       
              representations which underlie the basic module theory and the                 
              structure of the cohomology ring of the group which acts on the                
              fundamental homological constructions.  The principal                          
              investigator plans to study the prime ideals which are the                     
              annihilators of cohomology elements and their relations to                     
              transfers from and restrictions to subgroups of the group.                     
              Categorical techniques, as well as hypercohomology spectral                    
              sequences associated to certain duality complexes and actions of               
              the Steenrod algebra, will be used for this investigation.  Other              
              questions on the structure of modules in the more general                      
              categorical setting will also be examined.  In addition, the                   
              principal investigator will continue work on the homological                   
              algebra of Hilbert modules and on computer methods for the                     
              computation of cohomology.                                                     
                   The research supported concerns the representation theory of              
              finite groups.  A group is an algebraic object used to study                   
              transformations.  Because of this, groups are a fundamental tool               
              in physics, chemistry and computer science as well as                          
              mathematics.  Representation theory is an important method for                 
              determining the structure of groups.
