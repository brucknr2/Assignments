Abstract    :
                   This project continues previous research in network time-                 
              synchronization technology and proposes new algorithms adapted for             
              use in high speed, wide area networks including supercomputers and             
              superscalar workstations.  The technology makes use of the Network             
              Time Protocol (NTP) widely used now in the Internet, together with             
              engineered modifications designed to improve accuracy in high speed            
              networks, including SONET and ATM.                                             
                   The project also involves the design and construction of                  
              precision timekeeping devices that provide improved timekeeping                
              accuracy which it is expected to improve to some tens of                       
              microseconds in modern RISC-based workstations.  Finally, the                  
              project involves the conduct of experiments designed to evaluate               
              the success of the research and assist technology transfer to                  
              computer manufacturers and network providers.                                  
                   The requested support will permit the assignment of                       
              professional management and staff resources to implement these                 
              programs so that the efforts of the regional and other midlevel                
              network participants can be coordinated.
