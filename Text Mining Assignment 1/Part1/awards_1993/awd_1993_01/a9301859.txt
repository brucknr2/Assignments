Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program                 
              will assist the Department of Chemistry at the University of                   
              California at Los Angeles in the purchase of a new console and                 
              probes and a new set of field homogeneity shims for a 500 MHz                  
              nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer.  These items                    
              will be used with the existing 11.5 Tesla superconducting                      
              magnet, which is still in excellent condition.                                 
                                                                                             
              The research projects which will be enhanced by the acquisition                
              of this instrument include:                                                    
                                                                                             
              1)  Multidimensional NMR spectral analysis of DNA-Drug,                        
              intramolecular DNA-Peptide, carbohydrate-DNA and RNA-Protein                   
              interactions using synthetically modified biopolymers,                         
                                                                                             
              2)  Host-Guest chemistry:  Preservation of highly strained                     
              molecules by their incarceration,                                              
                                                                                             
              3)  Study of the synthesis and reactivity of novel boranes,                    
              carboranes and metallacarboranes, and synthetic organic                        
              chemistry,                                                                     
                                                                                             
              4)  Exploratory studies in dynamic, pericycle, and radical                     
              organometallic chemistry.                                                      
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
              %%%                                                                            
              The Department of Chemistry at UCLA also has an excellent                      
              record in the development, use and maintenance of cutting-edge                 
              scientific equipment and a strong, outstanding record in                       
              training their students, both graduate and undergraduate, in                   
              the use of such instrumentation.                                               
                                                                                             
              This proposal will assist in the purchase of a modern nuclear                  
              magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer.  This instrument is an                  
              essential tool for faculty members at the University of                        
              California-Los Angeles engaged in chemical research.  The                      
              instrument provides important information which in most cases                  
              can be used to determine the geometric and/or molecular                        
              structure of newly synthesized molecules.
