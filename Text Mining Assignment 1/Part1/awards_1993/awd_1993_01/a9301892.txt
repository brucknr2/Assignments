Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This  project  continues the study on particle transformation  in              
              mesopelagic slope waters off Monterey Bay where particles (marine              
              snow)  from  the  surface waters of the epipelagic  zone  undergo              
              rapid  regeneration.  New instrumentation, developed  by  project              
              engineers   at  the  Monterey  Bay  Aquarium  Research  Institute              
              (MBARI),  and a Remote Operating Vehicle (ROV) will  be  used  to              
              recognize  and  separate slow sinking class of marine  snow  from              
              more  colonized, reactive and rapidly sinking class for community              
              analyses.   Dr. Silver and colleagues will examine  the  role  of              
              biological  processes  that  lead to carbon  remineralization  of              
              marine  snow,  and other losses that appeared closely  linked  to              
              events  that  have  been difficult to study by  more  traditional              
              approaches.
