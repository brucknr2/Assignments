Abstract    :
              9301693  Tree       Flow-induced crystallization of semi-crystalline polymers to
               produce extended chain crystals provides an opportunity to produce 
              lightweight, high-strength materials from inexpensive feed stocks  by carefully
              controlling the processing variables.  The project  will bring together
              researchers from the fields of polymer  processing, thermodynamics and computer
              simulation to study flow-  induced crystallization kinetics.  The research will
              use a  specially designed rheometer and a newly developed rheo-optic  technique
              to obtain in-situ, quantitative measurements of flow-  induced crystallization
              kinetics in crystallizable polymers.  Anew  model of polymer crystallization
              kinetics, based on current  molecular theory for polymer molecules, will be
              developed and  incorporated into a simulation of polymer processing in order to
               optimize the design of polymer processing operations with respect  to the
              degree of extended chain crystallinity, which in turn is  directly related to
              the mechanical properties of the product.       The research may allow the
              production of high performance  plastic parts from inexpensive polymer
              materials through the  careful control of processing variables.
