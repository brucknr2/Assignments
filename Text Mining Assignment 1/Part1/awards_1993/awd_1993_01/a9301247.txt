Abstract    :
              This RUI addresses structure-property relations in a range of                  
              glasses which have both fundamental and technical importance.  The             
              primary measurement technique is nuclear magnetic resonance, which             
              provides information about the bonding and local environment of the            
              atoms in the various glasses.  The latter include alkali                       
              borosilicates, particularly high alkali content glasses.  The                  
              results bear on the glass stability under different processing                 
              conditions.  This information is of interest in the context of                 
              technical production of glasses.  A further sub-project addresses              
              the glass transition in the materials.  The nature of the glass                
              transition and its structural basis remains a challenging problem              
              in condensed matter science.
