Abstract    :
              9301440  Terray        The project goal is to study the physics of the coupled
              air and  water surface boundary layers.  The study is based on analyses of 
              existing data collected during two prior experiments (WAVES and  SMILE).  Some
              of the important research topics to be undertaken in  this project are: (1) the
              research is pertinent to an improved  understanding of the microscale features
              of air-sea interaction,  (2) the research is potentially beneficial to the
              improvement of  the formulation of air-sea fluxes in coupled models of
              atmosphere-  ocean systems, and (3) the research seeks to address fundamental 
              issues about processes critical to the physics and biology of the 
              ocean-atmosphere interface.
