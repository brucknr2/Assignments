Abstract    :
                 9301393   R.A. Amos      This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase
              II project deals with the design, synthesis and evaluation of biocompatible,
              photoderivatizing reagents for surface treatment of plastics used in biomedical
              applications.  This approach will permit the selection of the polymer solely on
              the basis of physical and mechanical properties and then provide a tenacious,
              covalently-bound surface coating which imparts the required biocompatibility. 
              This Phase II project will seek to optimize the synthesis and use of the new
              fluorinated azide photoreagents developed during Phase I and to develop
              additional compounds which will further explore optimizing the activation
              wavelength and enhancing reactivity towards less reactive polymer surfaces. 
              Coating reagents will be assessed for their ability to impart a lubricating
              surface.  A variety of polymer substrates will be utilized with a focus on
              specific medical devices provided by prospective client companies.      This
              SBIR Phase II project will continue the advances initially started in the Phase
              I project.  An important goal of the SBIR Program is the ultimate conversion of
              NSF-supported research into technological innovation and commercialization.
