Abstract    :
              9301350  Marotske  This project will focus on a model to estimate the
              climatological  annual cycle of the Indian Ocean from hydrographic, current
              meter  and altimetric data.  The observations would be synthesized using  a
              general circulation model (GCM), with the adjoint of the GCM used  to drive the
              model toward the data.  The techniques to be developed  are intended to provide
              a complete estimation framework for the  synthesis of field data to be acquired
              in the planned Indian Ocean  Expedition, which is part of the World Ocean
              Circulation Experiment  (WOCE).  Further, it will provide a basin-scale
              prototype of the  estimation studies needed to synthesize the entire global
              WOCE data  set.  ***
