Abstract    :
                   This proposal examines microstructural evolution during                   
              supersolidus liquid phase sintering (SLPS).  This is a                         
              densification technique for powdered metals in which liquid forms              
              along grain boundaries causing particle disintegration, capillary-             
              induced rearrangement of grains, and solution reprecipitation.                 
              Included are considerations of the nature of liquid flow and the               
              particle disintegration mechanism related to initial particle                  
              composition, cooling rate, and microstructure.  Process variables              
              include temperature, particle size, heating rate, and pre-sinter               
              annealing.  Factors affecting the sintering behavior include                   
              wetting, pore filling, liquid film migration, and compact                      
              densification.  Several characterization techniques (optical and               
              electron microscopy, dilatometry, and differential thermal analysis            
              are employed to study the microstructural evolution and influence              
              of processing variables).  Sintering maps that show the significant            
              parameters are an output of the research.

                   This process offers near net-shape forming capability for high            
              quality parts.  Potential applications include steam turbine                   
              blades, engine components, and tool steels.
