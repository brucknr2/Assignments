Abstract    :
              9301209  Schaffer       This project investigates the potential for processing
              metals  using pulsed magnetic fields.  The research employs positron 
              annihilation spectroscopy (PAS) to determine the effects of the  pulsed
              magnetic fields on material structure.  The (PAS) results  are supported by
              X-ray diffraction, hardness, and resistivity  measurements.  The material
              structure-related measurements are  correlated with mechanical property
              measurements (tensile, hardness  and wear).  Modeling of the
              magnetically-induced defect recovery is  pursued by consideration of the
              behavior of the overlapping stress  fields created by the pulsed magnetic field
              and the defect  structure.  %%%       This research will clarify material
              structural changes induced  by magnetic-induced defect recovery.  This could
              lead to new  processing treatments for metallic materials.  ***
