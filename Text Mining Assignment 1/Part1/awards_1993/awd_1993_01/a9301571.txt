Abstract    :
              9301571  Raizen       This program will investigate atom-field interactions 
              with trapped ions using a novel linear rf ion trap. This  trap, combined with
              laser cooling techniques, will allow  high accuracy in spectroscopic studies of
              trapped ions. The  spectroscopy will be used to study a broad range of 
              experiments in fundamental physics including interference of  the fluorescence
              from two atoms, collective behavior of  atoms in an optical cavity, and single
              and several atom  optical bistability. Possible extensions to conditional 
              quantum measurements will be considered. The long term goal  of the proposed
              research is an experimental study of single  atom optical bistability.
