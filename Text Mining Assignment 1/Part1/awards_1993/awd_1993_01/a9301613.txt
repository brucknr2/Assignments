Abstract    :
              This grant will provide funds to edit and publish an annual                    
              review of the student biomedical engineering design projects                   
              supported by the Research to Aid Persons with Disabilities                     
              program at NSF.  There are presently over 20 institutions                      
              participating in this program.  The fourth edition is being                    
              completed and this grant will support the publication of an                    
              additional three volumes/years.  The work not only provides                    
              a catalog of devices/projects for use by the rehabilitation                    
              community but it is also being used as resource material in                    
              engineering design courses.
