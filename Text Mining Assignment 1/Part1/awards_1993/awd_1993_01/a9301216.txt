Abstract    :
              9301216  Hanlon       This award supports a 5-day meeting with the following 
              goals:         i) to highlight recent exciting research in a setting  which
              gives the speakers ample     time to explain the work  and the listeners ample
              time to absorb and discuss what  they hear;         ii) to promote
              participation and involvement by people  early in their careers;         iii)
              to include a broad scope of mathematical subjects.    100 participants are
              expected to attend.  15-20 graduate  students are included in this number.  The
              NSF support will  be used to help defray the expenses of the speakers, as well 
              as providing partial support for graduate students and very  recent Ph.D.
              recipients who are conference participants.
