Abstract    :
                  9301307  Ashley  This research will develop a predictive model of project 
              performance based on measures of organizational and technical  integration
              during the design and construction process.  The  outcomes predicted include:
              cost, schedule, quality of the  engineering-procurement-construction (EPC)
              process, and completed  facility quality, i.e., how well the completed facility
              meets the  needs of the owner/operator.  Input variables include measures of 
              the organization and technical integration on the project, the  types of
              contracts among the project team, and other factors.
