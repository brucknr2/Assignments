              This Americas Program award will support                                       
              attendance to a workshop on the theoretical and                                
              computational aspects of molecular and                                         
              materials sciences.  The workshop, organized by                                
              Dr. David A. Micha of the University of                                        
              Florida, will bring together advanced doctoral                                 
              students and research scientists to review                                     
              recent developments in the field, with emphasis                                
              on methods and computer programs of general                                    
              applicability with mid-range computing                                         
              facilities.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              Participants are well-known investigators, and                                 
              the topics to be discussed will address new                                    
              methods to interpret data and to predict                                       
              phenomena in areas of theoretical chemistry                                    
              such as molecular clusters, polymers and                                       
              proteins, solid surfaces and others.                                           
              The meeting will address issues of human                                       
              resource development, both in this country and                                 
              throughout the hemisphere, in an area of much                                  
              current activity and promise.
