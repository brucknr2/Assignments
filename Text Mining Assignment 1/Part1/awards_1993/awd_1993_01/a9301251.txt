Abstract    :
              Dr. Paul A. Deck has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research                      
              Fellowship in Chemistry. Dr. Deck's doctoral degree was from                   
              the University of Minnesota under the supervision of Professor                 
              Paul Gassman. Dr. Deck will continue research at Northwestern                  
              University under the sponsorship of Professor Tobin Marks. Dr.                 
              Deck's postdoctoral training will provide him with skills in                   
              advanced NMR techniques and x-ray crystallography as he studies                
              new methods for the preparation of Lewis acidic transition                     
              metal and f-element organometallic complexes and their                         
              application to alkene polymerization. Longer term he plans to                  
              investigate ion-pairing and ligand reorganization dynamics in                  
              cationic Group 4 metallocene catalysts.

              The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is                  
              viewed as an important infrastructural program designed to                     
              broaden the knowledge and experience of new Ph.D.s and attract                 
              them into meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research                 
              and teaching.
