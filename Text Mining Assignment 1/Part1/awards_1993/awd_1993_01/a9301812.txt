Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is the role of clay mineral surfaces                
              in the synthesis of oligomeric molecules relevant to the origin                
              of life. Specific goals include the development of                             
              regiospecific syntheses of oligoribonucleotides in aqueous                     
              solution without using blocking groups to help understand how                  
              the olignucleotides required for the "RNA World" first formed.                 
              Template directed syntheses of oligomers of A and G will be                    
              studied using U and C oligomers respectively, formed by                        
              montmorillonite catalysis, and will be carried out in the                      
              solution phase and on mineral surfaces. An investigation of the                
              effect of different phosphorus activating groups on oligomer                   
              formation will utilize 2-aminobenzimidazole and 4-aminopyridine                
              groups. The elongation of oligomers, 10 mers to 50 mers, will                  
              be studied in which the incorporated pyrophosphate groupings                   
              will be utilized as sites of ligation. The role of mineral                     
              catalysis of the ligation reaction will be investigated.

              With this Renewal Award, the Synthetic Organic Program is                      
              supporting the research of Dr. James P. Ferris of the                          
              Department of Chemistry at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.                   
              Professor Ferris will focus his work on the study of the role                  
              of clay minerals in the synthesis of oligomeric molecules                      
              relevant to the origin of life. In doing so, he will develop                   
              new synthetic approaches to the preparation of olignucleotides                 
              and gain understanding how the oligonucleotides required for                   
              the "RNA World" first formed. These studies in prebiotic                       
              chemistry are of intrinsic general interest to all segments of                 
              society.
