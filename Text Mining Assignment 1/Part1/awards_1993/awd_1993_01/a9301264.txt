Abstract    :
              9301264  Rosenberg  This is a project to continue a program of observations and 
              data analysis based on data obtained by an imaging riometer at  Sondre
              Stromfjord, Greenland.  The riometer will be operated  and maintained with
              support from the Danish Meteorological  Institute.  The main objective of this
              one year study is to  substantiate previous results pertaining to the riometer 
              absorption produced by drifting patches of enhanced F region  ionization.  If
              the riometer is sensitive enough to detect the  presence of these patches, then
              its usefulness in studies of  ionization processes in the upper atmosphere can
              be exploited  in future investigations.  ***
