Abstract    :
              This project deals with the analysis and development of an                     
              innovative sensing system that combines conventional remote                    
              sensors and signal processing techniques that extract the                      
              corrupted portion of signals. Typically, in diagnostic systems                 
              the sensor output is corrupted by the machine itself since the                 
              sensor cannot be generally placed at the site where the signal to              
              be measured is generated. For example, in machine tools, some                  
              cutting  force sensors depend upon the measurement of strain in                
              the outer race of the machine tools, others depend upon the load               
              measured at the base of the tool turret, and still others depend               
              on the current consumed by the feed or spindle motor. A                        
              monitorability index (MI) is developed in this research which not              
              only improves the sensor reliability and performance, but also                 
              provides a means of systematically optimizing the design of a                  
              particular sensing system. The design procedure yields a simple                
              rational method to determine the most appropriate signals to                   
              measure and the type of transducers to use. The technique of                   
              using a model to correct the corrupted signal belongs to the                   
              class of techniques known as model-based estimators. This sensing              
              system, which is based on MI and is called Model Based Sensing                 
              (MBS) is implemented for tool force and spindle bearing                        
              monitoring on existing machine tools and its performance is                    
              compared with traditional model-based estimation strategies.***
