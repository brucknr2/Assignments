Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A series of process oriented modeling studies of the dynamics of               
              the Gulf Stream/Deep Western Boundary Current crossover will be                
              conducted in order to understand how the crossover interact with               
              the basin-scale thermohaline circulation through the exchange of               
              heat, mass and chemical tracers between the boundary and the                   
              interior.
