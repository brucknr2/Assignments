Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Studies have demonstrated that photosynthesis rates at any given               
              irradiance depend critically on the light history over time scales             
              of minutes to hours and days.  However, these studies have failed              
              to provide a predictive understanding of photosynthesis in variable            
              light.  New technology makes it possible to examine the roles of               
              photosynthetic, photoprotective and photoinhibitory processes in               
              controlling the instantaneous rate of photosynthesis.  This                    
              technology includes fast repetition rate (FRR) fluorescence for                
              examining photoprotection, photoinhibition and photosynthesis, and             
              18O mass spectrometry for measuring the rate gross photosynthesis              
              and oxygen cycling in the light.                                               
                                                                                             
              In the laboratory, this study will calibrate FRR fluorescence-based            
              estimate of gross photosynthesis against measured rates of gross               
              photosynthesis obtained from 18O2 exchange and quantify the roles of           
              photoprotection and photoinhibition in controlling the rate of                 
              photosynthesis. In field research, in situ FRR fluorescence                    
              measurements will be used to establish a two-dimensional (i.e.                 
              depth and time) description of the photochemical and non-                      
              photochemical quenching coefficients, calculate the instantaneous              
              rate of photosynthesis and examine the roles of the photoprotection            
              and photoinhibition in controlling phytoplankton photosynthesis in             
              situ.
