Abstract    :
              Bhuyan         This project addresses the problem of designing coherent  caches
              for scalable multiprocessors with shared address spaces.   Maintaining cache
              coherence in large-scale systems is time  consuming due to the lack of
              sufficient broadcasting capacity in  the interconnection networks.  A dynamic
              cache coherence protocol  is being designed and evaluated to reduce the cache
              coherence  overheads in large systems.  This protocol limits invalidation or 
              update traffic to a subtree of the interconnection network.  The  first phase
              of the project consists of embedding rooted trees  into various networks, and
              studying the hardware and timing  complexities of directories using the
              embeddings.  In a second  phase, issues such as fault tolerance adaptive
              routing, and task  mapping are being addressed.  The research makes use of
              analytic  techniques and execution driven simulation.
