Abstract    :
                   A School of Mathematics and Theoretical Physics will be                   
              held on Guadeloupe May 30 to June 13, 1993.  The school will                   
              present to students at or near the Ph.D. level discussions of                  
              recent progress in such fields of mathematical physics as non-                 
              commutative geometry, quantum groups, integrable systems, and                  
              the foundations of quantum field theory.  These fields                         
              represent an exciting interplay between mathematics and                        
              physics which is potentially very useful to both.  The                         
              lecturers include a number of excellent practitioners of these                 
              fields.
