Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The goal of this program is determination of chemical kinetic data             
              for reactions of metals involved in toxic emissions associated with            
              incineration of waste materials.  Reactions of nickel, lead,                   
              cadmium, chromium, and antimony, with HCl, O2, CO2, and Cl2 as                 
              oxidants, will be studied; atomic metals as well as metal oxides               
              and halides will be included in this investigation.  A uniyue set              
              of facilities (high-temperature fast-flow and pseudo-static metals             
              high-temperature photochemistry reactors) will be used to provide              
              rate coefficient and mechanistic data on individual isolated                   
              reactions over a 300-1800K temperature range at pressures from 0.01            
              to 1.0 atmospheres.  Laser-induced fluorescence and other optical              
              and mass spectroscopic techniques will be employed for rate                    
              coefficient and product identification measurements.  Information              
              obtained from the experiments will be used to aid in estimation of             
              kinetics for reactions of metal species other than those addressed             
              in the experiments.  This work is a logical continuation/extension             
              of current studies being conducted by the PI under NSF and Air                 
              Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR) funding.                           
                                                                                             
              The presence of many metallic species in municipal, hazardous, and             
              biomedical waste incinerators can lead to emissions of toxic                   
              gaseous molecules and fly ash, as well as production of toxic                  
              components in bottom ash and slag.  The combustion process                     
              influences the distribution of the metals among these various                  
              "products" and their particle size and oxidation state, as well as             
              the ease of leaching of the residual solids.  This work is also                
              relevant to combustion processes used to decontaminate soils, since            
              these can lead to similar gaseous and particle emissions, and to               
              emissions from high-temperature industrial devices such as glass               
              smelters, calciners, aluminum furnaces, and lead smelters.
