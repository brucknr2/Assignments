Abstract    :
                   Investigations in the theory of Markov processes are to be                
              done with concentration on branching measure-valued processes and              
              related processes in spaces of functions.  The general form of                 
              branching, the relationship between path properties of                         
              superdiffusions and positive solutions of nonlinear differential               
              equations and modeling of "a random cloud" with interacting parts              
              are among the principal objectives of the investigation.                       
                   Measure-valued branching processes have been studied since                
              the late 1960s and have attracted a great deal of attention                    
              during the last five years.  This is a remarkable class of                     
              processes, which provide a tool for the investigation of                       
              spatially distributed populations.  They also make it possible to              
              extend important connections between probability theory and the                
              theory of partial differential equations.
