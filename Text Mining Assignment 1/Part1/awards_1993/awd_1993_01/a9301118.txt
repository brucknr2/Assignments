Abstract    :
                   The investigations of this proposal will be made on number-               
              theoretical problems dealing with zeta functions and automorphic               
              forms.  The Fourier coefficients of automorphic forms, Eisenstein              
              series, and the special values of certain zeta functions are the               
              main objects of study.                                                         
                   This is research in the field of number theory.   Number                  
              theory starts with the whole numbers and questions such as the                 
              divisibility of one whole number by another.  It is among the                  
              oldest fields of mathematics and it was originally pursued for                 
              purely aesthetic reasons.  However, within the last half century,              
              it has become an essential tool in developing new algorithms for               
              computer science and new error correcting codes for electronics.
