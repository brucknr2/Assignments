Abstract    :
              This grant is for partial support of a special international                   
              symposium on elastic waveguides to be held during June 6-10, 1993              
              at the University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia.  The                 
              proposed symposium will allow the presentation of state-of-the-                
              art research findings in the area of waves propagation in elastic              
              waveguides to the leading workers in this field from academe,                  
              government laboratories and industry.  This area is currently of               
              great interest in the fields of non destructive evaluation (NDE)               
              of devices and structures, and in seismology.  In particular, the              
              symposium will feature presentations of research concerning the                
              propagation of elastic waves in half spaces, mechanical                        
              waveguides, and layered media.  General topics in elastic wave                 
              propagation will also be presented, as well as scattering                      
              problems.
