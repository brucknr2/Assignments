Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This proposal requests continued CEDAR support to operate and             
              analyze data from the set of optical instruments at Peach Mountain             
              Observatory (PMO), Michigan.  The program will address the                     
              following objectives:  1) the continued collection of mesospheric              
              and lower thermospheric geophysical data (neutral winds and                    
              temperatures for airglow layers corresponding to hydroxyl and                  
              atomic oxygen) to establish a long-term, mid-latitude climatology;             
              2) the coordination and operation of experiments through the                   
              comparison of data sets acquired simultaneously by the FPI, ASI,               
              and FTS; 3) the training of graduate student in the operation of               
              the optical experiments plus the interpretation of the data sets;              
              4) the submission of the collected geophysical data sets to the                
              CEDAR NCAR data base; 5) the analysis and publication of results.              
              In particular, data from the PMO will be used to characterize                  
              gravity-wave and tidal behavior in the mesosphere and the lower                
              thermosphere in an attempt to determine the significance of the                
              background neutral-wind bulk flow in the interpretation of gravity-            
              wave fluctuations.
