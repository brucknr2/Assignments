Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              In this project, 15 RAFOS (SOFARS spelled backwards) floats will be            
              deployed in about 5 different Mediterranean Water eddies (Meddies)             
              as they are discovered during the French Semaphore Experiment in               
              the vicinity of the Azores Front.  The trajectories and life                   
              histories of these 5 Meddies will be observed to learn more about              
              their typical translation characteristics, life expectancy, and                
              mode of propagation.  The Semaphore Experiment has a major                     
              observational component in 1993 during which extensive                         
              Conductivity-Temperature-Depth (CTD) and Expendable                            
              Bathythermograph (XBT) surveys will be made in the region 31.5-                
              36.ON, 20.5-26.OW, where a large number of historical Meddy                    
              observations were made.  these CTD and XBT casts will be used to               
              identify the salinity and temperature anomalies of the Meddies and             
              will be instrumental in the design of the deployment strategy for              
              the floats.  The long-range objectives of this study are to                    
              understand how Mediterranean Water disperses into the North                    
              Atlantic and, specifically, to understand the role of Meddies in               
              the maintenance of the Mediterranean salt tongue.//
