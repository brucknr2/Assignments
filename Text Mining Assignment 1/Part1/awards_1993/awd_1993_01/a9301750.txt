Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              Recent studies indicate that ultraviolet radiation can penetrate to            
              considerable depths on tropical reefs. Persistent high levels of UV            
              penetration, resulting from extended periods of calm sea                       
              conditions, have been shown to induce stress leading to the loss of            
              symbiotic zooxanthellae (i.e., bleaching) in reef-building corals.             
              These conditions may have contributed significantly to the regional            
              mass coral bleaching events observed in the Caribbean during 1987              
              and 1990.  This project will continue monitoring penetration of UV             
              radiation, sea temperatures, and recovery of coral exposed to UV               
              radiation.  In addition, the project will be expanded to evaluate              
              the effects of UV radiation on the early life-history stages,                  
              namely planula larvae and newly-recruited juveniles, of predominant            
              coral species.  While increases in UV radiation are predicted to be            
              minimal at low latitudes, increased frequency of calm sea                      
              conditions predicted by global warming will lead to enhanced water             
              column clarity and high UV penetration with subsequent negative                
              effects on reef corals.  This project, by experimentally defining              
              the maximum UV intensities that can be tolerated by larval and                 
              juveniles corals, will provide insight into the role that current              
              intensities of UV radiation play in limiting recruitment and                   
              shaping subsequent coral community structure.
