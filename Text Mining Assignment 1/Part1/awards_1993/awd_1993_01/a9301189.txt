Abstract    :
              Multipole-accelerated iterative                                                
              methods for potential problems will                                            
              be developed to include automatic                                              
              discretization error control, in                                               
              particular, methods to include                                                 
              higher-order boundary elements and                                             
              automatically refine low-and high-                                             
              order elements.  Two test problems                                             
              with known analytical solutions                                                
              specified by a mixture of Neuman                                               
              and Dirichlet boundary conditions                                              
              will be used to investigate the                                                
              low-order approach and to give a                                               
              direct numerical error calibration.                                            
              Utilizing the above results several                                            
              localized approached will be                                                   
              developed with different

              purpose of element refinements with                                            
              specified error bounds.
