Abstract    :
                   Professors Dye and Reich will study several question about                
              the convergence of products of nonexpansive mappings.  One of the              
              main questions will be whether the von Neumann algorithm admits a              
              nonlinear extension.  Also of fundamental importance is whether                
              von Neumann's conclusion of strong convergence persists when the               
              maps are drawn randomly from more than two projections.                        
                   Operator theory is that part of mathematics that studies the              
              infinite dimensional generalizations of matrices.  In particular,              
              when restricted to finite dimensional subspaces, an operator has               
              the usual linear properties, and thus can be represented by a                  
              matrix.  The central problem in operator theory is to classify                 
              operators satisfying additional conditions given in terms of                   
              associated operators (e.g. the adjoint) or in terms of the                     
              underlying space.  Operator theory underlies much of mathematics,              
              and many of the applications of mathematics to other sciences.
