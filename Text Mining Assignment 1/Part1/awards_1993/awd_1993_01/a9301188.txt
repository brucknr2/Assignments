Abstract    :
              Abstract - Tsotsis      Inorganic membranes have been the subject of research
              for liquid and gas separations.  The interest in such membranes is due to their
              unique thermal and mechanical properties and their chemical and microbiological
              resistance.  Inorganic membranes are today finding applications in areas like
              the food and pharmaceutical industries, in waste water treatment and in
              catalysis.  Membrane reactors combine reaction and separation in a single unit
              operation.  The membrane selectively removes from the reaction zone species,
              which would otherwise thermodynamically or kinetically limit the reaction
              progress.  This, in turn, increases the reactor yield and results in diminished
              downstream separation requirements and smaller operational costs.    The goal
              of this project is to gain a better understanding of how liquid macromolecules
              diffuse and react in small pores (typical of those found in membranes and
              catalysts).  The principal invetigators' interests are in petroleum liquids. 
              They plan to investigate the applicability of ceramic membrane reactor
              technology in the area of oil and asphaltene hydroprocessing and to study, in
              depth, the relevant technical questions and issues.  Two types of alumina
              ceramic membranes will be studied, membranes prepared by anodic oxidation of
              aluminum, primarily for fundamental transport and reaction investigations, and
              membranes prepared by the Sol-Gel technique, for similar investigations, but
              also for testing the catalytic membrane reactor concept.  Both kinds of
              membranes have a virtually unimodal pore size distribution and show excellent
              separatory functions, but have di stinctly different surface properties and
              unique pore structures.        \&  1z   CONTROL INI             d `3
