Abstract    :
                   This research explodes a unique tubular wire manufacturing                
              process that can allow the production of unlimited length                      
              superconducting wires.  This unique manufacturing process is                   
              intended to overcome the problems with the conventional                        
              manufacturing method of packing powder in a fixed-length hollow                
              tube, and can be applied to any superconducting powder and sheath              
              material combination.  This process is researched using the Bi-                
              Pb-Sr-Ca-Cu-O powder and silver sheath.                                        
                   This research will provide long, continuous, uniform, high-               
              temperature superconductor wires and tapes for use in the                      
              manufacture of magnets, motors, generators, energy storage devices             
              and magnetic resonance imaging equipment.
