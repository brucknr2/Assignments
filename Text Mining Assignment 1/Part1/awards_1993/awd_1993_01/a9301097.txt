              Response of the Eq. Pacific to Quaternary Climate Change:                      
              Sedimentary Chemical Evidence For Glacial-Interglacial Contrasts In            
              Productivity, Chemical Transport Rate, and Terrigenous Influence               
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
              Chemical indicators of productivity, chemical transport rate, and              
              terrigenous flux will be used to determine the biogeochemical                  
              response of the central equatorial Pacific Ocean to Quaternary                 
              climate change.  The strategy involves the analysis of downhole                
              records along a latitudinal transect.                                          
                                                                                             
              Sedimentary chemistry will be done on 15 m long piston cores                   
              recovered at 2 degree S, 0 degree, 2 degree N, 5 degree N, along a             
              transect at 140 degree W, thus covering the sharp equatorial                   
              gradients in productivity and associated depositional and                      
              diagenetic processes.  Studies will also cover the effect of the               
              dominant aeolian source of terrigenous particulate matter (the                 
              intertropical convergence of the tradewinds, at 5 degree N).                   
              Downhole sampling strategy will result in resolution of < 7 ky for             
              the past 1 Ma. Interactive behavior of the three major biogenic                
              components (CaCO3, Corg, opal), the aeolion component, and an                  
              extensive suite 40 major, trace, and rare earth elements will be               
              assessed.
