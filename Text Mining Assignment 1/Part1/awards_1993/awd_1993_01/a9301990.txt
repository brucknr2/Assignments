Abstract    :
                   Ursinus College requests support from NSF for connection of               
              its campus network to PREPnet.  PREPnet is the midlevel network                
              located in the state of Pennsylvania.  PREPnet will provide                    
              operations management and information services and it will give                
              Ursinus College connection to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45               
              million bits per second) National Backbone network.                            
                   The university needs greater functionality and network speed              
              to be able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file                  
              transfers along with being able to implement a more reliable mail              
              system.  Students and faculty research will benefit from the link.             
              This is also a unique opportunity for the school to explore                    
              innovative educational resources.
