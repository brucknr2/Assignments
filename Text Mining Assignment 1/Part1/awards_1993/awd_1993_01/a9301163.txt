Abstract    :
                   The investigation concerns the generation of nonlinear                    
              sloshing waves which run cross-wise to a rectangular channel as                
              opposed to along it. The research involves components of                       
              experimentation, mathematical analysis and numerical computation.              
              Also required is the construction and installation of a wavemaker              
              instrumental in generating the sloshing waves. A mathematical                  
              model will be developed to analyse the observations and provide a              
              basis for the pertinent numerical methods and solutions.
