Abstract    :
              9301690 Kumara          This research project is concerned with the design,
              development and implementation of formal automata theory based architecture for
              the modeling and control of Flexible Manufacturing Systems(FMS).  The major
              challenge of implementing FMS at the factory level is to realize automated
              control.  An appropriate FMS model is required for the purpose of control
              software design and implementation.  In this research, the EMMN (Extended Moore
              Machine Networking) model based on automata theory for FMS control systems will
              be investigated.  This will give rigorous theoretical foundations for modeling
              FMS.  The basic concept behind the EMMN model is to facilitate distributed
              control approach by representing a system as a collection of interconnected
              abstract machines.  A control hierarchy will be established based on
              abstractions of control activities.  By using object oriented methodology, the
              EMMN model of a FMS control system will be implemented into object based
              software modules, based on which an integrated environment for system
              specification, verification and on line control will be realized.          The
              applicability and validity of this methodology will be demonstrated via the
              simulation of an experimental FMS control system.  In addition the scalability
              and liveness properties will be investigated with respect to a real life FMS. 
              The model, which will be implemented via Object Oriented scheme in a
              multitasking environment, will be evaluated for portability by considering
              adaptation on a laboratory based and a real life FMS.
