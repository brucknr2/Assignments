Abstract    :
              The Coastal Research Laboratory at the Woods Hole Oceanographic                
              Institution will upgrade an aging two-axis, forward-scatter laser              
              Doppler volicimeter (LDV).  The LDV is mounted on a large 17-meter             
              recirculating seawater flume that is used by a large number of                 
              investigators for a variety of projects.  Several electronic and               
              electro-optical components of the system have deteriorated over                
              time due to the continual presence of salt aerosols and others have            
              become obsolete.  The flume provides a steady flow of recirculating            
              seawater and experiments are set up in the flume to measure the                
              fine-scale flow characteristics and turbulence fluctuations assoc-             
              iated with the experiment. The LDV measures the Doppler frequency              
              shift from two laser beams that are aimed into the flow.  Advanced             
              signal processing is used to derive detailed patterns of the                   
              flowing seawater.  The use of flumes and LDVs for better under-                
              standing flow characteristics is becoming increasingly important               
              for studying oceanographic processes, especially within the bottom             
              boundary layer.  This upgrade will cost-effectively provide a                  
              state-of-the-art system that will be available for shared use.
