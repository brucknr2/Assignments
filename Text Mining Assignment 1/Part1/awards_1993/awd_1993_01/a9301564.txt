              Interdisciplinary Trophic Studies (BITS 2)  Chronic undersampling of the marine
              environment, including both biological and physical components has been, and
              remains, a major block to understanding how the marine ecosystem functions and
              how it will respond to changes, whether natural or anthropogenic.  This
              research directly addresses this problem by applying advanced acoustical
              technology to the problem of measuring spatial distributions of zooplankton and
              micronekton at a mooring, and collecting abundance and size data with a high
              temporal resolution over long periods.  There are three specific objectives of
              this research:  1)  operation and maintenance of a recently installed pilot
              mooring on the Southern California coast, 2) development of a vertical
              profiling platform to allow collection of long time records with high
              resolution of vertical fine structure in the plankton and related biophysical
              variables, and 3) deployment and installation of a mooring for studying
              zooplankton in the northwest Atlantic on Georges Bank as part of GLOBEC, a
              component of the US Global and Climate Change initiative.
