Abstract    :
              9301588  Marcelin  This U.S.-Argentina Science Program award will support the 
              collaboration of George Marcelin of the University of  Pittsburgh and Eduardo
              Lombardo of the School of Chemical  Engineering in Santa Fe, Argentina.  The
              project aims to  study the catalytic combustion of methane and the formation 
              and destruction of NO using perovskite-type oxide catalysts.    Natural gas is
              an important fuel for stationary energy  generation.  However, Nox emissions
              from natural gas  combustors, particularly those that operate at high 
              temperatures, are of increasing environmental concern.  Development of a
              successful NOx control process requires a  fundamental understanding of the
              principles of NOx formation  and of the chemical interaction of oxygen and
              nitrogen  species with the catalytic surface.  This project will  combine
              catalytic combustion and NOx destruction in one  catalyst formulation, in order
              to explore the role of the  catalytic surface in forming and destroying NOx and
              to  identify intermediate species.  In addition to classical  techniques of
              catalysis research, steady state isotopic  transient kinetic analysis will be
              used to study the  reaction pathways, intermediates, and active catalytic 
              surface.  IR and NMR spectroscopic studies of adsorbed  species will help
              identify the intermediates on the catalyst  surface and the reaction paths that
              form them.  The  Argentine group has expertise in perovskite preparation and 
              characterization.  The U.S. group has expertise in NMR  characterization and
              isotopic transient kinetic analysis.  ***
