Abstract    :
              9301915  Flusberg       With the increase in atmospheric pollution and a new,
              growing  public awareness of resulting environmental damage, there is a need 
              for new technology to measure the concentration of trace species in  the
              atmosphere.  Extractive methods, in which a sealed sample of  air is analyzed
              in a laboratory, are expensive and are inapplicable  to continuous, in situ
              monitoring of concentrations.  Science  Research Laboratory (SRL) will develop
              an instrument called a laser  interferometric absorptiometer (LIA) to fill this
              need.  The basis  of this instrument is the interferometric measurement of the 
              optical-path change that occurs immediately after a pulsed laser  beam is
              absorbed by trace species present in one arm of the  interferometer.  This
              novel approach will lead to a breakthrough in  the technology of monitoring
              trace gases.  It will allow rapid in  situ measurements of trace-gas
              concentrations to be made for the  first time at parts-per-trillion (ppt)
              levels, 100-1000 times more  sensitively than instruments based on other
              approaches to monitor  trace species in the field.  In Phase I the
              characteristics of a  LIA were determined, and an LIA suitable for ppt
              trace-gas  measurements was designed.  IN Phase II, SRL will experimentally 
              research and demonstrate rapid ppt detection of several trace gases  including
              chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), major pollutants that are  responsible for
              depletion of the ozone layer and are considered  significant contributors to
              global warming.  In a privately funded  Phase III follow-on program, SRL will
              develop a commercial  instrument capable of measuring industrial emissions of
              CFCs and  other pollutants.
