Abstract    :
              9301972  Kosro  In this project, the PI will to carry out measurements of ocean 
              current velocities in the upper 300 meters, using an Acoustic  Doppler Current
              Profiler (ADCP).  Specifically, measurements will  be made across the Pacific
              at about 17!S, during the Spring of 1994  as part of the World Ocean
              Circulation Experiment (WOCE).  This  line is referred to as WOCE Hydrographic
              Program line P-21.   Measurements across boundary currents and in the central
              gyre of  the South Pacific will address the structure and transport of the 
              currents, provide a constraint for inverse models which will  evaluate mass,
              heat, and tracer budgets, and analyze the depth of  wind-driven shear.  ***
