Abstract    :
              This research concerns the modeling and analysis of various free-              
              boundary problems related to phase transition.  In particular,                 
              the general approach of phase field model is applied to several                
              basic problems: alloys, triple points, and crystal growth.                     
                                                                                             
              The goal is to gain insight into the freezing and melting                      
              processes in alloys, and the mechanisms of crystal growth.  The                
              results of this research will contribute to the objectives of the              
              advanced materials processing program.
