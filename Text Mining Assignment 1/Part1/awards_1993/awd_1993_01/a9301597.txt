Abstract    :
              This research project deals with probabilistic methods of                      
              tolerance analysis for mechanical systems subjected to                         
              discontinuity forcing functions. The dynamic equations are solved              
              using the alternating frequency/time domain method. The                        
              statistics is evaluated by determining the partial derivatives of              
              the Fourier  coefficients with respect to the random  variables                
              which, in this research, are link length tolerances and pin                    
              locations. These are representative of design variables of link                
              length tolerances, radial clearances and associated tolerances. A              
              nonlinear constrained optimization problem is  solved in order to              
              maximize the variances of  tolerances, while satisfying the                    
              specified constraints. The results of this research lead to the                
              development of an analysis and design tool for tolerance                       
              allocation in a dynamic system such as an internal combustion                  
              engine.***//
