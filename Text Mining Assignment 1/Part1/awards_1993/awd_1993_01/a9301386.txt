Abstract    :
              Erdogen Gulari  9301386    This is a Small Grant for Exploratory Research
              (SGER).  It is  concerned with the use of hot filament chemical vapor
              deposition  (HFCVD) to deposit high-purity films of nitrides of titanium, 
              gallium, and boron.  In this technique a hot tungsten filament is  used to
              decompose ammonia; the unstable nitrogen-containing  radicals then react with a
              vapor-phase form of the desired metal or  metalloid to deposit a thin film of
              nitride on a semiconductor  substrate (silicon in this study).  Composition,
              microstructure,  optical properties, and electrical properties of deposited
              films  are studied.  Films are characterized using X-ray photoelectron 
              spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, electron microscopy, X-ray  diffraction,
              Rutherford backscattering, photoluminescence, and  electron/hole mobility.  The
              gas phase chemistry of the method is  studied through experimental measurements
              and theoretical  modelling.    The materials produced in this study have
              potential for a variety  of microelectronic applications, from insulators to
              LEDs to high-  temperature applications.  Reliable methods for producing high- 
              quality thin films of materials are badly needed.
