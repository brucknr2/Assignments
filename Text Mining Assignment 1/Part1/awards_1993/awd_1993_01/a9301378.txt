Abstract    :
                   This research project will develop a flexible manufacturing               
              system based on a high-precision laser writing machine, for the                
              direct generation of rotationally-symmetric diffractive optics with            
              continuous profiles in photopolymers.  This machine will serve to              
              combine advanced computer-aided optical design and automated                   
              process control of the manufacturing station.  The integration of              
              optical design and manufacturing process control will reduce cost              
              and cycle time of high quality diffractive optics.                             
                   Successful implementation of the manufacturing system will                
              improve prospects for the long-term commercialization of                       
              diffractive optics. Important potential applications of the                    
              technology include medical instrumentation, optical data storage               
              and computing systems, head-up and head-mounted displays, laser                
              reprographics, space-based optical sensors, and precision optical              
              testing.
