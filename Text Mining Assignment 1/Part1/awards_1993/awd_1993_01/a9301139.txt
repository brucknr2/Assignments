Abstract    :
              This is an award to provide support for                                        
              exploratory research on a highly specific                                      
              immunoassay assay procedure using a                                            
              monoclonal antibody bioassay procedure for                                     
              detecting the presence of nitrifying bacteria                                  
              in water, wastewater and soil.  The research                                   
              extending developing a collection of                                           
              monclonal antibodies from Nitrosomonas                                         
              europaea, labeling these antibodies with a                                     
              commercial secondary antibody, and                                             
              quantifying the selectivity of the nitrifier                                   
              antibodies against all known fresh-water                                       
              nitrifying bacterial genera and a select                                       
              group of common environmental heterotrophs.                                    
                                                                                             
              Nitrification is currently an important                                        
              objective in treatment of wastewaters and is                                   
              likely to become mandatory by the turn of the                                  
              century.  This project addresses the problem                                   
              of obtaining a clear means of establishing                                     
              and identifying the potential for achieving                                    
              nitrification within biological wastewater
