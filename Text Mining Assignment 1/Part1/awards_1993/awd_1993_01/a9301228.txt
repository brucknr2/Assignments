Abstract    :
                 9301288  Straus       Determining the roles played by synoptic and planetary
              scale  motions in maintaining large-scale atmospheric regimes and in  causing
              transitions between distinct regimes is critically  important in understanding
              low frequency atmospheric variability  and is particularly germane to extended
              range (several weeks in  advance) forecasting.  Current medium range weather
              forecasting  models are poor at predicting these transitions, hence, major 
              changes in weather patterns are not well-forecast.       Dr. Straus will use an
              atmospheric general circulation model  (GCM) to conduct numerical forecasts
              designed to isolate the  various components of the atmospheric circulation and
              the  interaction among the various scales of motion.  In this study, he  also
              will attempt to separate midlatitude and tropical effects.   The results of
              this research have a clear potential for improving  extended range forecasting.
