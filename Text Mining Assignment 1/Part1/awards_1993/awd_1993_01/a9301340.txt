Abstract    :
                This project addresses the problem of giving full and formal  semantics to
              programming languages that combine a number of  complex features,  including
              memories, object-orientedness, rich  notions of type, exceptions, and 
              concurrency.  An  operational approach is taken to semantics since it is the
              only  method  with immediate potential for applicability to such rich 
              languages.  The  resulting operational theory also includes  a rich theory of
              equivalence  on programs to aid compiler writers  and language transformers.   
              This research  focuses on: (1) lifting concepts from domain  theory, such as
              finiteness and  omega-algebraicity, into full-featured languages, (2) giving
              semantic type  descriptions of full-featured languages, in particular the
              difficult case of  object-oriented languages, and (3) studying full-featured
              languages as  one  piece to discover interactions and conflicts, rather than 
              addressing each  feature in a separate study.
