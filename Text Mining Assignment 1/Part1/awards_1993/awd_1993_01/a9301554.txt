Abstract    :
              9301554  Silver    This award will support a study of fluid flow through
              accreted  sediments of the Costa Rica margin, the southern extension of the 
              Middle America Trench. Fluid flow along other accretionary margins  has been
              shown to be extremely important in controlling mechanical  and chemical
              characteristics of such margins. The Costa Rica margin  differs from other
              trench environments in having a low input of  pelagic sediment on the
              underthrusting ocean  plate and a low input  of continental derived sediments.
              Underthrusting of the oceanic  plate is high relative to other trenches and it
              therefore  represents an endmember of trench environments. The objectives of 
              the project are to locate sites of fluid venting, to sample the  fluids and
              relate them to structural features of the margin, and to  determine the
              heat-flow along the margin and its relation to fluid  flow. In addition to
              examining the basic fluid low system on this  margin, data from this project
              will be used for siting future drill  holes in the region. The project is a
              cooperative study between  scientists at the University of California at Santa
              Cruz, the  University of California at San Diego, and Columbia University. The 
              field program will be undertaken from the research submersible  Alvin.  ***
