Abstract    :
              The present work focuses on a new type of toughening mechanism --              
              extensive diffused damage surrounding in the main crack-tip.  The              
              proposed research is motivated by a recent discovery of a ductile              
              fracture mode in strain hardening brittle cement matrix composites             
              (SHBMC) reinforced with 1-4 % polyethylene fibers.  Crack                      
              propagation is observed to be accompanied by extensive volumetric              
              inelastic deformation surrounding the crack tip, in addition to                
              conventional fiber bridging and pull-out in the crack wake.  The               
              off-crack-plane energy absorption is found to be even higher than              
              the fiber bridging energy in some specimens we have tested so far,             
              with total fracture energy reaching 34 kJ/m2.  This represents                 
              roughly 3400 times the fracture energy of the virgin matrix without            
              fibers.  As reference, the fracture energy of aluminum alloys is               
              between 8 - 30 kJ/m2.  Experimental investigations on R-curve                  
              behavior, and on- and off-crack-plane fracture energy partitioning             
              will be conducted based on the J-based fracture testing technique.             
              Correlation between pseudo strain-hardening processes in uniaxial              
              testing and the spatial evolution of damage during the ductile                 
              fracture process in notched specimens will be used to establish the            
              detail micromechanisms of the ductile fracture mode.
