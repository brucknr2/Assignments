Abstract    :
              This project convenes a US-Japan Workshop on Earthquake                        
              Protective Systems in Tsukuba, Japan in December 1992.  This                   
              Workshop will involve researchers and designers from both                      
              countries to discuss progress in the development and                           
              application of earthquake protective systems to bridges.                       
              Topics to be covered include:  (1) innovative protective                       
              systems; (2) design methods for base isolated bridges; (3)                     
              design of utilities carried by isolated bridges so as to                       
              accommodate movement; and (4) full-scale verification of                       
              performance.                                                                   
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
              A comparison of US and Japanese isolation designs for the                      
              same bridge will also be made.  Designs will be completed                      
              before the 1992 Workshop, so that the results are available                    
              for presentation and discussion.  The program also includes                    
              site visits to several base-isolated bridges as well as                        
              several major bridges currently under construction in Japan.                   
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
              The Workshop is expected to produce recommendations about                      
              cooperative research projects which are of benefit of both                     
              countries.
