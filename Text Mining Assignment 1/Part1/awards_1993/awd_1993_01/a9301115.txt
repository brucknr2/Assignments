Abstract    :
              9301115  Jerard       This research increases the current knowledge base in the 
              field of numerically controlled (NC) machining of sculptured  surfaces.  This
              knowledge is important for any industry using five-  axis NC sculptured surface
              machining.  Two industrial collaborators  are included in the project. 
              Previous research has developed fast  and robust algorithms for simulation and
              verification of sculptured  surface NC machining programs.  The simulation
              method uses a  technique for discretization of parametrically defined surfaces 
              into a Surface Point Set (SPS).  The simulation method has been  used as a
              basis for generation and automatic correction of three  axis NC programs.  This
              research is focused on methods for five  axis tool positioning and geometric
              modeling of five axis path  swept envelopes.  This research specifically
              explores the following  questions: (1) What are the best algorithms for
              subdivision of  sculptured surfaces into a discrete representation to be used
              for  NC tool path generation?  (2) What is the time/accuracy trade-off  in
              using points versus polygons as a surface representation for NC  tool path
              generation?  (3) Can our non-isoparametric tool path  planning algorithm
              developed for three axis machining be extended  to the five axis case?
