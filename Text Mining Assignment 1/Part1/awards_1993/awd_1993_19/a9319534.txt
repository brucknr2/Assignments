Abstract    :
              Myelin is a multi-layered membrane that wraps around the  axons of neurons,
              insulates them, and allows nerve  conduction to take place efficiently.  One
              protein of  myelin, termed Po, behaves as an adhesion molecule and is  believed
              to hold the layers of myelin together.  In  addition, Po protein has been shown
              to enhance the growth of  a growing axon.  We are investigating what precise
              regions  of the Po molecule are involved in interaction with the  neuron to
              promote axonal growth.  Furthermore, we are  beginning to characterize the
              component on the neuron with  which Po interacts to bring about this effect. 
              Finally, for  the Po protein to function correctly it must reach its  correct
              cellular destination.  We are characterizing how the  cell that makes myelin,
              the Schwann, directs Po to its final  destination.
