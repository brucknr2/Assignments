Abstract    :
              9319512  Crimmins         The focus of this research is the study of the effects
              of   substitution on the tethering chain in intramolecular   enone-olefin
              photocycloadditions with regard to stereochemical   control.  The photoproducts
              will serve as precursors for the   synthesis of a variety of natural product
              types including   taxusin, magellaninone, serratinine and lubiminol.  %%%  With
              this renewal award, the Synthetic Organic Program is   supporting the research
              of Dr. Michael T. Crimmins of the   Department of Chemistry at the University
              of North Carolina,   Chapel Hill.  Professor Crimmins will focus his work on
              the use   of photocycloadditons for the synthesis of a number of   interesting
              natural products.  ***
