                    ABSTRACT    P.I.  Rebecca Huss-Ashmore/Christine Varga  SBR- 9319680   
              Adolescent preganancy is an important problem world-wide.  This is true not
              only because of its increase, but because of the associated health problems for
              young women and their babies.  In the U.S., adolescent mothers are
              characterized by having a high prevalence of obstetric and neonatal
              complications.  These are linked to maternal behaviors, especially  to
              inadequate antenatal care and poor nutrition.  It is also clear that the urban
              context affects pregnancy outcome by influencing both health-related and
              reproductive behavior.    In South Africa, adolescent pregnancy has also become
              a major problem.  South African studies have revealed an association between
              late or non-entry into antenatal programs and poor preganncy outcomes among
              urban teenagers.  However, almost no research has addressed intermediate
              factors affecting clinic attendance patterns.  Similarly, there is little data
              on adolescent diet.    This project will assess antenatal care and nutrition
              (diet and energy reserves), and examine the relationship between clinic
              attendance, nutrition and pregnancy outcome among urban South African
              primigravida adolescents.  Project objectives will be achieved by 1) the
              examination  of demographic and socio-behavioral factors and 2) investigation
              of nutritional status and 3) collection of pregnancy outcome data.    This
              study relates to the anthropological concern with human adaptation to specific
              environments - in this case, the modern urban environment.      The graduate
              student already has been awarded a Fulbright Fellowship and is in th e field.
