Abstract    :
              In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry   Division,
              Lon Knight of Furman University will use electron spin   resonance (ESR)
              techniques to study small cluster cation radicals.  The   radicals will be
              generated in low-temperature matrices using   x-irradiation as well as
              synchronized pulsed gas/pulsed laser   vaporization.  The experimental
              measurements will yield electronic   structure information which will be shared
              with theory groups for   collaborative analysis and interpretation.  Study of a
              series of   heavy-atom diatomic radicals should aid in the development of ab
              initio   spin-density calculations.      Information obtained from this work on
              small unstable ionized molecules   will be useful in determining the optimum
              conditions for fabricating   semiconductor microelectronic components, in
              identifying new interstellar   species, and in understanding reactions in the
              earth's upper atmosphere.
