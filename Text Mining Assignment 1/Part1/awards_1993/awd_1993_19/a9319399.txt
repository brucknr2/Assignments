Abstract    :
                          9319399  Peck, T.  The objective of this research is to improve the
              performance of  nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) microscopy systems by 
              fabricating the radio-frequency (RF) detection coil and  preamplifier on a
              single monolithic GaAs substrate.  This  combination of circuit elements can be
              designed to provide an  optimum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).  The RF microcoil
              will be  formed from 4-7 turns of a gold conductor in a planar geometry.   A
              simple tuning and impedance matching network will link the RF  coil to a single
              stage, common source configuration, GaAs metal  semiconductor field effect
              transistor (MESFET).  The amplifier  will be designed for high gain and low
              noise over the relatively  narrow bandwidth (300+/- 0.1 NHz) needed for NMR
              signal  detection.  Gallium arsenide MESFET amplifiers are ideal for this 
              purpose.    This project focuses specifically on the fabrication and testing 
              of a prototype integrated circuit for NMR microscopy.  The goal  is to
              establish the feasibility of this approach as a stimulus to  the future
              development of more advanced integrated circuitry for  NMR research.  Future
              developments in NMR microscopy (microcoil  arrays, scanning NMR microscopes,
              and superconducting RF coils)  will rely on advances in NMR integrated circuit
              technology.  This  proposal effort assembles a team of NMR, RF, and fabrication
               experts who are collaborating to develop the new technology.  The  success of
              this project is expected to have a major impact on NMR  microscopy in
              particular, with potential advantages for the  entire field of NMR spectroscopy
              and imaging.  ***
