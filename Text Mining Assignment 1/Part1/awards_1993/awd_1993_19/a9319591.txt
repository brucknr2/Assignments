Abstract    :
                  The goal of this research project entitled  "Electric Field  Interaction
              With Neuronal Tissue" is to study the mechanisms  by which electric fields can
              control and modify the activity  of neurons.  Electric fields can be easily
              generated near  and around neurons in the brain by placing electrodes in 
              specific locations and injecting known amounts of current.  Previous
              experiments have shown that currents applied at  very small amplitudes are
              capable of preventing the activity  of neurons and to interfere with their
              firing patterns.  The  research is aimed at the determination of the basic 
              mechanisms underlying these effects.  The results of the  research proposal
              will allow us to better understand how  electric fields can control the
              activity of neurons and may  lead to the design of a method to prevent abnormal
              neuronal  activity such as in epileptic seizures.
