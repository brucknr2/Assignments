Abstract    :
              9319881  Hanson  Virginia Polytechnic Inst.  Dr. Brian E. Hanson, Chemistry
              Department, Virginia Polytechnic Institute, is supported by the Inorganic,
              Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program for the synthesis of water
              soluble phosphines and to develop catalysts which dissolve or form micelles in
              water. Phosphines containing sulfonated aryl substituents will be prepared by
              several routes. The steric and electronic parameters will be widely varied and
              examples will be prepared with parameters similar to those of phosphines
              currently being used in catalysts. These newly prepared water soluble or
              surface active phosphines will be used to form catalysts which will be active
              for hydroformylation, hydrogenation, and/or asymmetric synthesis in water. 
              Chemical processes which can be carried out in an aqueous solution have
              potential environmental advantages arising from the non-toxic, non-polluting
              nature of water. However, catalysts which are used in many industrial processes
              do not dissolve and consequently cannot be used in water based processes. In
              this project catalysts which will operate in aqueous media will be devised,
              with those for industrially important hydroformylation, hydrogenation, and
              asymmetric  synthesis being targeted.
