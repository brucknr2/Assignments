Abstract    :
              9319085  Nastrom         The objective of this research is the investigation and
               interpretation of vertical motion, gravity waves, and there  vertical flux of
              horizontal momentum as measured by several 50 MHz  radars, including the
              flatland radar at champaign, Illinois, White  Sands, and several tropical
              stations in the Pacific.  In  particular, a new theory of gravity wave momentum
              transport will be  further developed and tested to explain the (mean) downward
              motion  in the midtroposphere at the Flatland site.  new and existing 
              measurements of momentum flux will be examined with respect to  various
              composite synoptic systems at the same site.  ***
