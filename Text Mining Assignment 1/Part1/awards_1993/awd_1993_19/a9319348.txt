Abstract    :
              9319348   Ricart       The Southeastern Universities Research Association (SURA)
               proposes to create the first, real, regional electronic library  in America. 
              The Monticello Electronic Library, as the SURA  project is named, will use
              complementary collection strategies  for electronic materials among
              participating SURA libraries and  SURAnet electronic document collection many
              times larger than any  single institution, even Harvard, could support.      
              Through the services of a group of experts in the SURA  region, and drawing on
              expertise from others to give a critical  national perspective, a set of
              proposals is being generated,  discussed and evaluated that will form the basis
              for the  Monticello Electronic Library.       A meeting of the group of experts
              together with other  representatives from SURA institutions, SOLINET, and
              SURAnet will  be held so that advocates for each proposal will give 
              presentations to this larger audience and discussion will follow.   It is
              expected that through this planning process, an exciting  but realistic set of
              proposals will emerge.  These proposals will  be incorporated into a report
              that outlines the Monticello  Library.  ***
