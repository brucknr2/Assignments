Abstract    :
              9319740  Weiller        The American Society of Limnology and Oceanography will
              develop a  program trageting biologically oriented aquatic scientists who have 
              recently obtained their Ph.D. Degrees, wish to pursue  interdisciplinary,
              aquatic science research, and benefit from the  cross-fertilization derived
              from combining limnological and  oceanographic research and perspectives.  The
              goals of the program  are to help integrate young scientists into the research
              community,  broaden their perspectives of the field, foster long-term collegial
               associations and collaborations across the spectrum of biologically  oriented
              limnology and oceanography, and interdisciplinary and  inter-institutional
              research.  A five-day symposium for 40 recent  Ph.D.'s will be held during
              October, 1994.  During the symposium  entitled "Dissertations Initiative for
              the Advancement of Limnology  and Oceanography" (DIALOG) Program, participants
              will make oral  presentations on their Ph.D. work, discuss emerging trends and 
              issues in limnology and oceanography, and work together to develop  a set of
              recommendations on one or more topics of current interest.
