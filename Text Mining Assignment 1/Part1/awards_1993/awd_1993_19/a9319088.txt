Abstract    :
              9319088  Rubloff       This topical conference is devoted to the science and 
              technology which underlie manufacturing processes and associated  vacuum based
              process and diagnostic equipment, particularly as  applied to microelectronics.
               Speakers at the conference will  elucidate concepts central to manufacturing
              effectiveness, describe  the nature of technology development and the
              manufacturing  environment, and emphasize early assessment of
              manufacturability.  They will also indicate how fundamental and applied
              research from  the AVS community can significantly benefit manufacturing by 
              focussing on key manufacturing issues, providing relevant insights,  and
              developing process, equipment, and diagnostic approaches for  well controlled
              manufacturing processes.
