Abstract    :
              9319775  MOLLER  The University-National Laboratory System (UNOLS) fleet of
              research  vessels, operated by academic institutions, provides support 
              services to those NSF sponsored researchers who require time at sea  to
              complete their investigations.  All of these ships use  oceanographic wire rope
              as part of this research support.   Arrangements have been made which allow
              bulk purchases of wire rope  resulting in considerable cost savings.    Twelve
              reels of wire rope will be purchased.  The wire rope is  stored until needed by
              the ship operators at the Woods Hole  Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) on the
              east coast and at the  Scripps Institution of Oceanography on the west coast.  
               Mr. Donald A. Moller, Marine Operations Coordinator, WHOI, will  manage this
              project.  ***
