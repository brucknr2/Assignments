Abstract    :
              9319874  Bradley       This project will support a travel grant program for the 
              1994 International Congress of Mathematicians to be held in  August 1994 in
              Zurich, Switzerland.  The Congress, which is held  every four years, is a
              meeting of mathematicians from all over  the world.       The American
              Mathematical Society will administer the     program, which will culminate in
              the selection of a  group of  mathematicians from the United States who will
              receive awards  providing partial support for their travel to this meeting.
