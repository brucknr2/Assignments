Abstract    :
              9319917  Lau  We propose a novel all-optical, self-routing switching network
              based on an innovative address coding scheme.  The proposed work includes
              concerted research efforts at the network, systems and device levels. 
              "All-optical" switching is accomplished by tagging the data packet with an
              address code consisting of a serial combination of wavelengths, so that
              switching can be done simply by sensing the wavelength without the need for
              first converting the high-speed data to electronic form.  Self-routing is
              exercised by sensing the wavelength content of the address tag in a data
              packet.  At each switching stage of a multistage switching network, the
              switching node performs a latching function which directs the entire content of
              the packet to the appropriate output port based on a certain section of the
              wavelength address code, until the final destination is reached.  Under this
              scheme, a large number of address codes can be accommodated and is not limited
              by the number of available wavelengths as in conventional wavelength division
              multiplexed networks.      The proposed work consists of investigation of a
              suitable multiwavelength laser transmitter based on surface emitting laser
              arrays, a switching node which sorts and routes incoming optical signals to
              appropriate output ports based on the wavelength tag of the input signal,
              optical crossbar switches which are based on switched semiconductor amplifier
              arrays, and system/architectural studies of this type of all-optical
              self-routing network.  A small-scale demonstration network is planned which
              uses the novel components described above, which serves as a testbed for
              investigating systems related issues as well as ascertaining the performance of
              the interacting devices and components under real traffic environments.  ***
