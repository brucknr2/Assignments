Abstract    :
              This research is concerned with finding efficient hierarchical  testability
              techniques for controller-data path systems.  The  approach is to start with
              module level test sets, derived for any  suitable fault model, and use high
              level synthesis to ensure that  these test sets can be combined into a system
              level test set which  can provide complete test coverage of all the embedded
              modules.   The aim is to invent algorithms that reduce test generation and 
              application times, yet obtain complete, or nearly complete, system  level test
              coverage with little or no area and delay overhead.  The  testability
              techniques are being embedded into algorithms for  scheduling and allocation. 
              Also being explored are methods for  performing synthesis with both low power
              and testability as design  criteria.
