Abstract    :
                     9319870  Comaroff  This project involves the dissertation research of a
              student in  cultural anthropology from the University of Chicago.  The  student
              will investigate political conflict in the Maldives.  Using ethnographic
              techniques of participant observation and in-  depth interviews, the student
              will examine how the local state  legitimates its actions by claims to
              religious authority, and how  that claim is contested by local religious
              practitioners of magic  and other informal religions.         This research is
              important because political power in many  states is legitimated by official
              claims of religious  authorization or legitimacy.  Advances in our
              understanding of  how this legitimization comes about, and how it is defended 
              against counter-claims, can help us deal with like situations of 
              political-religious conflict in other places.  The project will  also advance
              our scientific capacity by training a student in  social science techniques and
              in regional studies of the  important area of South Asia.  ***
