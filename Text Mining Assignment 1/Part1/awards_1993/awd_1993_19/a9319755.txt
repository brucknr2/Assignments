Abstract    :
              9319755  Axelson    Vasopressin is a neuropeptide that function as a chemical
              messenger  in the brain.  It has been shown to be involved in regulating a 
              number of behaviors, including aggression, reproduction,  communication and
              learning and memory.  For example, social  recognition memory, or the ability
              to recognize familiar animals,  is thought to be mediated by vasopressin in the
              lateral septum  region of the limbic system.  Interestingly, social recognition
               memory is sexually dimorphic.  Females can maintain the ability to  recognize
              familiar members of the species significantly longer than  males.  Moreover,
              the vasopressin system in the limbichypothalamic  system is also sexually
              dimorphic.  Dr. Axelson is interested in  this structure-function relationship.
               He will tease apart this  association with the use of the gonadal steroids at
              different times  during perinatal development.  By combining biochemical, 
              neuroanatomical and behavioral techniques, Dr. Axelson and his  students will
              extend what is known about the role of androgen and  estrogen in determining
              the development of functional sex  differences by clarifying hormonal
              mechanisms underlying cellular  changes in vasopressin and correlating these
              changes with altered  expression of a sexually dimorphic vasopressin dependent
              behavior.   Moreover, this project will provide resources and research 
              opportunities for a number of excellent undergraduate students and  introduce
              them to the field of hormonal control and development and  possible influence
              their decision to become future researchers.  ***
