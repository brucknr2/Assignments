Abstract    :
              January 10, 19949319620  Bhattacharya    Description:  This project provides
              partial  support for a U.S. mathematician to engage in  collaborative research
              with colleagues at the  Indian Statistical Institute in Calcutta and in  New
              Delhi. In Calcutta he will interact with  Dr. B.V. Rao on iterations of i.i.d.
              maps  belonging to certain special classes such as  the quadratic family.  In
              Delhi he will  interact with Dr. R.L. Karandikar on problems  in Markov
              processes, especially stochastic  differential equations and diffusions.    
              During his sabbatical, Dr. Bhattacharya will  also briefly visit institutes in
              Germany and  Japan.   ***
