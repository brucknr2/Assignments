Abstract    :
              9319871 Mishler          The Herbaria at the University of California, Berkeley
              house a botanical collection of international importance to research in
              biodiversity, ecology and systematics of plants.  The collection, which is now
              divided across two locations in Berkeley, will be combined into a newly
              renovated Life Sciences Building.  This support will allow placement of the
              collection cases on space saving compactor carriages, which will enhance
              collection growth and access by researchers and students. %%% This support will
              enable the housing of the University of California herbaria collections in
              compactorized units in a newly renovated facility on campus.  The collections,
              an international resources for research and education in the biodiversity and
              ecology of plants, are now hosed in two geographically separate locations, one
              of which is off campus and therefore not readily accessible.  The reintegration
              of the two collections on compactor carriages in one collection area will
              increase room for future growth and provide efficient access to students and
              researchers. ***
