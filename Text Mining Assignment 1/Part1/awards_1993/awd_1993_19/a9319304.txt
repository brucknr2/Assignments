Abstract    :
              9319304  Clark    Technical abstract: The main issues addressed by this project
              are  the static and dynamic properties of spin density waves (SDW)  in 
              anisotropic  conductors. Nuclear magnetic  resonance  (NMR)  spin  echoes  will
              be used as a microscopic probe, in conjunction  with  electrical  transport.
              Most of the work will be on the  Bechgaard  salts  (TMTSF)2X (X=PF6, ClO4,
              AsF6, etc.). Both  "ordinary"  and  field  induced spin density waves with
              varying degrees of pinning  will be investigated. The physical quantities to be
              obtained from  this  work  include  the  temperature  dependence  of  the 
              order  parameter, the displacement of the condensate in response  to  an 
              electrical  field  below  threshold, its sliding  velocity  above  threshold, 
              the spatial and temporal distribution of the  sliding  velocity  above
              threshold, SDW memory and repinning effects,  and  the   temperature  and 
              frequency  dependence   of   SDW   phason  fluctuations.    Non-technical 
              abstract:  The  purpose  of  this  project  is  to  investigate an unusual
              property of several organic materials that  conduct electricity. At low
              temperatures the conducting electrons  form a semiconducting state with an
              undulating magnetic structure  called  a spin density wave (SDW). This SDW is
              usually pinned  to  the  underlying  material imperfections. When, however,  a 
              small  electric  field  above  a certain threshold  is  applied  to  the 
              material,  the SDW slides. Under these conditions, it  becomes  a  new  type of
              electrical current. The measurements to be made  are  electrical  conduction
              and nuclear magnetic resonance  spin  echo  studies  of the basic properties of
              these SDWs. They include  the  size  of the undulating magnetic field, how its
              size varies  with  temperature, its thermal vibrations, how it moves when
              driven  by  an  electric  field, and the complex way it becomes pinned  again 
              when the electric field is removed.      p:\wickman\abstract\clark.doc
