Abstract    :
              Medium energy physics research on hypernuclear spectroscopy  and muon catalyzed
              fusion will be performed.  The  hypernuclear studies will be carried out as
              part of the  CEBAF Hall C and Hypernuclear Spectroscopy System (HNSS) 
              collaboration.  The HNSS Phase I and II is a fully approved  CEBAF experiment
              to measure photo- and electroproduction of  hypernuclei.  Ongoing work in muon
              catalyzed fusion will  continue in connection with an approved TRIUMF and
              Vienna.  At CEBAF, responsibilities include:  design review of the  SOS
              spectrometer particle identification system,  construction of the electron
              spectrometer's scintillator  hodoscope and alignment hardware, and
              participating in the  design of a trigger method to correlate electron-arm 
              information with the Kaon-arm, producing an efficient  hypernucleus trigger at
              an acceptable rate.  Also, a  prototype beam intensity and position monitor for
              Hall C,  based on a commercial SQUID magnetometer will be tested.  For work at
              TRIUMF large area, cryo-capable silicon diodes  will be produced for detection
              of stopping charged fusion  products from muon catalyzed fusion in layered
              frozen  hydrogen targets.  ***
