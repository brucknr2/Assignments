Abstract    :
              9319038  Ahuja    This is the first year funding of a three-year continuing
              award.   The research focuses on analysis, development, real-time 
              implementation, and initial exploration of real-world application  of a new
              image transform.  The transform is intended for  multiscale, low-level image
              segmentation (i.e., extraction and  representation of image structure at all
              geometric and photometric  scales present in an image).  The transform detects
              contours and  skeletons of image regions, and identifies the cross-scale 
              relationships among them.  Implementation of the algorithms on  highly-parallel
              architectures will be studied, as well as  development of special purpose
              hardware for real-time  implementation.
