                                        ABSTRACT                                  AST-9319895 
              Smith, Harding    This proposal will support a 3-year program of observational 
              studies of the relationship between dusty active galactic  nuclei (AGN) and
              luminous Starburst galaxies.  The two  phenomena -Starbursts, where rapid
              formation of massive,  hot, young stars produces high luminous energy output,
              and  AGN, thought to be powered by gravitational energy as a  massive compact
              object accretes material at the nucleus of a  galaxy-are found together in many
              galaxies and there is an  increasing body of evidence that there may be a
              casual or  evolutionary relationship between them.  The focus of this  research
              program will be imaging and spectroscopic  observations of Starbursts and AGN
              using a newly developed  mid-infrared imaging spectrometer, constructed at UCSD
              by B.  Jones and R. Puetter, on the 10-meter W.M. Keck Telescope on  Mauna Kea,
              Hawaii.  Supporting observations, using  University of California optical
              facilities and national  radio facilities will also be made.
