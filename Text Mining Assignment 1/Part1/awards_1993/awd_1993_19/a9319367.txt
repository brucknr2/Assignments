Abstract    :
              9319367  Budnick    Technical abstract:  The microscopic origin of the increase
              of  magnetization and Curie temperature in gas insertion modified hard 
              magnetic systems (including A samarium iron alloy) will be studied  with
              nuclear magnetic resonance techniques.  The improved magnetic  properties can
              be achieved by the introduction of C and/or N into  interstitial sites. 
              Results will be correlated with conclusions  drawn from neutron diffraction and
              Moessbauer studies.    Non-technical abstract:  It has been recently
              established that the  magnetic properties of certain transition metal rich
              materials were  significantly improved with the addition of gases such as
              carbon  and/or nitrogen.  This, as yet unexplained, discovery is of special 
              interest to fundamental science but also to the development of  improved
              magnetic recording heads.  The results will be compared to  previous
              measurements with other techniques, notably neutron  scattering and Moessbauer
              studies.  ***
