Abstract    :
              9319987  Yang  The proposal program stresses the importance of understanding
              practical device interfaces by making use of both surface spectroscopies and
              electrical measurements.  The chemical nature of the semiconductor surface and
              interfaces will be studied with X-ray photemission spectroscopy (XPS).  In
              addition, we plan to use Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) to assess the issues
              of stoichiometry and interface segregation.  These spectroscopic results will
              be corroborated by current-voltage (I-V), current gain, capacitance-voltage
              (C-V) and contact resistance measurements.  The data of XPS and AES will be
              used as sign-posts giving us the insight and direction to overcome an existing
              material difficulty and improve the device performance. Specific problems to be
              addressed include GaAs surface passivation, SiGe oxidation and non-alloyed
              ohmic contact formation.  ***
