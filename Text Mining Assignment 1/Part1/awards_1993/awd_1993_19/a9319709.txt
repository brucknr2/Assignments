                            9319709 Harvey         &  Abstract    This research will
              investigate reactions of survivors in the Midwest to the floods in the summer
              of 1993.  Respondents will be solicited via advertisements in newspapers and
              posted in community meeting places and contact with local agencies such as the
              Red Cross and mental health services.  Responses will be gathered via telphone
              and mail surveys, interviews, written narratives about their losses, and diary
              record keeping from approximately 200 280 people living in Iowa, Illinois,
              Missouri, and Wisconsin.  The subjects will reflect diversity in age, gender,
              race, socio economic status, urban rural home location, and occupation  and who
              have experiences different kinds of loss as a result of the flooding.  Subjects
              will include farmers, small business owners, non farmer/non business persons
              who were forced out of their homes by the flooding. A baseline comparison group
              will be people who lived in the region during the floods but who did not
              experience the loss of substantial physical property, jobs or income.  During
              the next year, archival data will be gathered to assess the possible
              relationshops between people's experience of the flooding and the occurrences
              of events such as divorce, bankruptcy, and mental health visits.
