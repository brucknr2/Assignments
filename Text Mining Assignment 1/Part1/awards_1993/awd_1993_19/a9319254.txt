Abstract    :
              9319254  Greenwald    This award supports a two-year cooperative  research
              project between Professor Gilbert  Greenwald, Department of Physiology,
              University  of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, Kansas,  and Professor
              Kazuyoshi Taya, Laboratory of  Veterinary Physiology, Tokyo Univesity of 
              Agriculture and Technology, Tokyo.  The joint  project focuses on mechanisms
              regulating  species-specific ovulation rates in mammals.      The investigators
              will investigate the factors  responsible for one species ovulating 1-3 ova 
              (guinea pig) and another ovulating 10-12 ova  (hamster).  They will analyze the
              hypothalamic-  pituitary-ovarian axis, with the Japanese group  focusing on in
              vivo approaches and the U.S.  investigator emphasizing in vitro methods.  The 
              question being addressed is timely and  important to students of reproductive 
              physiology and will enhance our understanding  of the mechamisms underlying the
              determination  of the numbers and extent of folliculat  development during each
              follicular cycle.  ***
