Abstract    :
              9319693  Nowycky    Neurons and endocrine cells release chemical messengers to 
              communicate with other cells.  The triggering signals for  release begin with
              the entry of calcium from the  extracellular environment.  Calcium ions appear
              to act on  many proteins in a coordinated fashion for the release  process to
              occur.  In this grant proposal, we will use real-  time measurements of release
              from single cells to study the  intracellular responses to calcium entry which
              are necessary  for release.***
