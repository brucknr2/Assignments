Abstract    :
              9319844  Schatz  This award will support the distribution and continued 
              development of the Worm Community System (WCS).  This is an  electronic
              community system, or digital library, containing the  knowledge of a scientific
              community and a software environment to  enable interaction with this knowledge
              across wide-area networks.   In particular, WCS contains the formal and
              informal data and  literature of the community of molecular biologists who
              study the  nematode work C. elegans.  The library collection of WCS enables 
              researchers to search for desired items, navigate links between  related items,
              and make personal annotations.  This proposal is  being jointly supported by
              the Information Technology and  Organizations program of the Directorate for
              Computer and  Information Science and Engineering and by the Database 
              Activities in the Biological Sciences program.  ***
