Abstract    :
              9319371  Peters    This project will undertake a comparative study of the
              relation between syntax and semantics, taking as a case study an intensive
              investigation of the syntactic realizations and interpretive possibilities for
              reciprocal constructions.  Reciprocals are particularly well-suited for an
              investigation of the syntax-semantics interface because they distill and
              combine characteristics of a number of other constructions.  Syntactically,
              reciprocals may be realized as pronouns, as verbal affixes, or as adverbials. 
              In the first two respects, they have much in common with pronominal and
              intransitivizing reflexive constructions.  Semantically, reciprocals behave as
              semantic operators, sharing characteristics with quantifiers.  The project has
              two overall aims:  to explore correlations between the syntactic realization of
              the reciprocals and its interpretation, and to examine the semantics of
              reciprocity and the status of the reciprocal as a semantic operator.  Because
              of the complex, multifaceted nature of reciprocals, an investigation of
              reciprocity will illuminate the syntax and semantics of other constructions
              whose characteristics they share:  the syntax and semantics of anaphoric
              relations and syntactic valence-reducing operations, the semantics of plural
              noun phrases, and the syntax and semantics of other scope-bearing operators
              such as negation and quantification.
