Abstract    :
              9319641  Kisslinger       Research in theoretical medium energy nuclear physics
              in the  following areas:  (1) studies of perturbative and nonperturbative  QCD
              for the quark/gluon structure of hadrons and nuclei by QCD  sum rule methods
              and by light-cone Bethe-Salpeter models; and (2)  the development of
              relativistic Hamiltonian dynamics for nuclear  physics and for quark models of
              hadrons.  In (1), the method of  QCD sum rules will be used for the
              determination of hadronic  properties.  For the nucleon, studies will include
              the axial  coupling constant, the neutron-proton mass difference and the 
              parity-violating nuclear interaction.  Weak hyperon decays will  be calculated.
               For heavy-light mesons vector-pseudoscalar mass  differences and leptonic
              decay constants are being determined  including both perturbative and
              nonperturbative QCD.  Extensions  of the QCD sum rule method will be studied
              using nonlocal  condensates for quark distributions.  The transition from 
              nonperturbative to perturbative QCD will be studied in light-cone 
              Bethe-Salpeter models of pion and nucleon elastic form factors.  Studies of
              quark cluster structure of nuclei, and properties of  hadrons in nuclear matter
              will also be carried out.       In (2), a major study of nucleon Compton
              scattering,  recently completed, will be extended to other areas.  Extensive 
              calculations of nucleon electroexcitation using light-front  particle dynamics
              will proceed.  Earlier treatments of deuteron  electromagnetic processes will
              be extended to different kinematic  regimes, including quasi-elastic
              electrodisintegration and  photodisintegration.  A new study of nucleon Compton
              scattering  will proceed.  ***
