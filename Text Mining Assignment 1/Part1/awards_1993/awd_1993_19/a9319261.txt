Abstract    :
              9319261  Kowalski    The Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for
              Process  Analytical Chemistry at the University of Washington has invented  a
              new sensor design called a flow probe.  The flow probe  incorporates sampling
              sample pre-treatment and regent chemistries,  and analytical detection into a
              micro-sized device.    This project funds the development of a calibration
              software  package to provide the tensorial calibration needed for field 
              development and testing of the sensor systems.    Funds for this project are
              being provided by the U.S. Department of  Energy's Office of Environmental
              Restoration and Waste Management.    The Program Manager recommends the
              University of Washington be  awarded $486,000 for two (2) years with the funds
              provided by the  U.S. Department of Energy.
