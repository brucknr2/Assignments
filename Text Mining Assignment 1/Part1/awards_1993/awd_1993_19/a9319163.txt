Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program
              will assist  the Department of Chemistry at Iowa State University in the
              purchase of a parallel  computational facility using IBM SP1.  This equipment
              will enhance research in a number  of areas including the following:  the
              development and application of parallel computational  software in electronic
              structure theory, surface dynamics and statistical mechanics, and  scattering
              theory.    A workstation network of fast, modern computer workstations is a new
              way to satisfy the  computing needs of chemistry departments.   Such a
              "computer network" also serves as a  development environment for new
              theoretical codes and algorithms, provides state-of-the-  art graphics and
              visualization facilities and supports research in state-of-the-art applications
               of parallel processing.
