Abstract    :
              9319536  Simasko      The objectives of this project are to biophysically
              characterize  a background conductance in pituitary cells and to determine the 
              physiological role of this conductance.  The investigators  believe this
              background conductance (Na+ selective or non-  selective cation) provides the
              depolarizing drive necessary for  activation of voltage-dependent calcium
              channels.  Activation of  voltage-dependent channels leads to a calcium influx
              which in  turn stimulates hormone secretion.  The investigators plan  to 
              characterize the conductance by patch clamp electrophysiological  techniques. 
              The role of the conductance in cytoplasmic calcium  regulation will be
              determined by single-cell Ca2+ measurements  using the fluorescent calcium
              indicator fura2.  The role of this  conductance in regulation of secretion will
              be determine din  single cells by membrane capacitive measurements and by
              reverse-  hemolytic plaque assays.  If this conductance is found to have  the
              physiological function hypothesized by the investigators, it  will be an
              important step in understanding how hormone secretion  is regulated.  ***
