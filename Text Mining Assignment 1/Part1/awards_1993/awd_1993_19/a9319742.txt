Abstract    :
              This research is on techniques for testing circuits having random  pattern
              resistant faults.  The focus is on methods for synthesizing  random pattern
              testable circuits.  The synthesis algorithms being  developed include
              algorithms for design of random pattern testable  two level and multi-level
              combinational logic; extensions to some  classes of sequential logic are also
              being investigated.  Two  methods being pursued are weighted cellular
              automaton, and fixed  bit biased pseudo-random pattern generator.
