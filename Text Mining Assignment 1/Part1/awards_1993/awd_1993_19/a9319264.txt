Abstract    :
              9319264  Tsui    Technical abstract:  The fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE)
              and  related physics of strong correlations in two dimensions will be  studied
              in advanced GaAs/A1xGa1-xAs heterostructures at low  temperatures and high
              magnetic fields.  The research has three  objectives:  (1) To use novel sample
              structures to study tunneling  into the FQHE liquid and to investigate boiling
              of the liquid; (2)  To investigate the role of disorder in determining the
              nature of  the reentrant insulator around the 1/5 FQHE liquid and the physics 
              governing the transition between them; and (3) To search for the 
              Josephson-like currents in the double layer FQHE state.    Non-technical
              abstract:  It has been possible to realize two  dimensional electron systems in
              advanced materials of semiconductor  single-crystal thin film structures of
              different chemical  compositions.  The physical properties of these electrons
              differ  fundamentally from the ordinary three-dimensional charge carriers  in
              bulk semiconductors.  Specifically, the charge carriers  condense, in the
              presence of a high magnetic field, into an  incompressible electron liquid.  It
              is proposed to carry out a  series of experiments which seek to determine under
              what conditions  does this new liquid boil, when and if it freezes, does it
              freeze  into a two dimensional electron crystal or some other form of  electron
              matter.  ***
