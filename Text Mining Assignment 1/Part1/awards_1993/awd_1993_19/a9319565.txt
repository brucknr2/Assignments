Abstract    :
                  During development of the nervous system, or neurogenesis, it is  possible
              to trace the lineage of cells leading to adult cell types.   For all cells that
              will become nerve cells, or neurons, a group of  genes has been identified that
              are characteristically activated to  express protein products .  Several of
              these "neuronal precursor"  genes are likely to have regulatory functions
              during neurogenesis.   This project uses the insect Drosophila as a model
              system with  well-known genetics to investigate one such gene.  The gene called
               "prospero" or "pros" is believed to act as a regulatory gene by  expressing a
              protein that binds to specific regions of molecular  sequences in the nuclear
              DNA.  Molecular techniques are used to  assay the binding sites, the
              identification of potential target  genes, and the sequence elements required
              for gene regulation.   Clarifying how this key gene works to regulate neuronal
              lineage in  early development of Drosophila will be an important step toward 
              understanding the molecular processes underlying initiation and  execution of
              neurogenesis.  The results will be fundamental to  further work on regulation
              of neuronal differentiation and process  outgrowth, in the vertebrates as well
              as the invertebrates, and the  results will have an impact beyond neuroscience
              to developmental  biology and genetics.
