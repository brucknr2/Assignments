Abstract    :
              9319640  White  This research project is in the general area of Analytical and 
              Surface Chemistry and in the subfield of surface dynamics.  During the tenure
              of this three-year continuing grant,  Professor White and his students will
              investigate the kinetics  and dynamics of photon- and electron-driven processes
              in  molecular adlayers. From the photon-driven processes, both  photochemical
              and photophysical events, as well as the  competition between them, will be
              investigated.  Using low  energy electrons, comparable bond breaking and energy
              transfer  processes will be studied. The objective of the project is to 
              increase our understanding of both the kinetics and dynamics  that are
              operative in nonthermal systems at surfaces.  %%%  The primary objective of
              this research is to investigate the  interactions of photons and electrons with
              molecules adsorbed  on solid surfaces.  Improved understanding of such systems
              is  important to progress in many technologically important areas  of research
              including catalysis, separations, and environmental  chemistry.  ***
