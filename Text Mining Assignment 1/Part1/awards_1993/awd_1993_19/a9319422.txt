Abstract    :
              9319422  Rutherford  The issues to be studied are the impacts of mitigation
              measures  taken by governmental agencies and the judicial decisions on land 
              use and building regulations of coastal areas subjected to the  risk of
              hurricanes.  The project will:  assemble macrogeographic  and fiscal
              information of federal assistance in the major recent  hurricane disasters;
              analyze relevant statutes and case law  including the United States Supreme
              Court decision in Lucas vs.  South Carolina Coastal Council to determine the
              scope of federal  legal authority in hazards mitigation; and examine the
              influence  of federal actions on the recovery process.  The objective of the 
              study is to identify areas of mutual reinforcement, areas of  contradiction and
              of opportunities for better use of federal  resources in hazards mitigation vis
              a vis coastal development.  The results of this research, with specific
              recommendations for  policy improvements, will benefit other researchers, and
              the  public and private sectors involved in natural hazards  mitigation.  ***
