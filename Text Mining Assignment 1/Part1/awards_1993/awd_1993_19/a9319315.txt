              of the species, the young must be cared for until they can subsist on their
              own.  Until recently, little research has been directed towards the elucidation
              of the neural mechanisms underlying parental behavior.  It is now known that
              the preoptic area is involved in the regulation  of maternal responsiveness. 
              Destruction of this brain region prevents the display of maternal behavior, and
              direct local application of hormones to this region can stimulate maternal
              behavior.  Although it is recognized that the preoptic area is important, the
              way in which it produces its influence over the behavior is still not known. 
              Dr. Numan's research is directed at providing this answer.  Using
              neuroanatomical and neurochemical techniques, he will examine the larger neural
              circuitry within which the preoptic area operates to mediate maternal behavior.
               Dr. Numan will determine the areas in the brain that project to the preoptic
              region, and where the preoptic area, in turn, projects to influence maternal
              behavior.  Moreover, he will determine the neurochemicals used in the
              identified neural circuits.  This basic research forms the beginning of our
              understanding of the neural substrates of maternal responsiveness.  Once the
              biological underpinnings of normal behavior are defined, it will be possible to
              identify what might go wrong in the brain during abnormal parenting.  It is
              this typ e of basic research that will eventually lead to uncovering of some of
              the biological causes of poor mothering such as child abuse and neglect, and
              disorders such as postpartum depression. ***
