              9319952 Walsh "Water Cycle Variations in North High Latitudes"           This
              project will serve as a bridge between global climate modeling and regionally
              focussed hydrologic studies of northern high latitudes.  It will mesh with both
              the Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment (GEWEX) and the Atmospheric Model
              Intercomparison Project (AMIP).  The first task will be the compilation of a
              climatological database, including monthly fields as well as spatial and
              temporal variances, for use in (a) validating climate model simulations of the
              high latitude hydrologic cycle and its variability, and (b) quantifying the low
              frequency variability in high latitude hydrologic quantities.  The database
              compilation will focus on precipitation and runoff fields, supplemented by
              computations of atmospheric moisture flux convergence, which will be used to
              estimate the net P E (precipitation minus evapotranspiration) on a regional
              basis.  The second task will be to diagnose quantitatively the high latitude
              hydrologic cycle of the AMIP simulations in order to determine the reasons for
              the model overestimation of arctic precipitation.  The last task involves the
              use of a regional atmospheric model to determine what resolution is required to
              realistically simulate the spatial and temporal variability of precipitation
              over topographically complex areas in high latitudes.  All three tasks are
              interdependent and each is an important contribution to efforts to increase our
               ability to estimate the potential for global climate change. ***
