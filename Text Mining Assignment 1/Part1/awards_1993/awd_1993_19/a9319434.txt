Abstract    :
              9319434  Krawinkler  This project is concerned with the development of basic 
              concepts and fundamental information needed to formalize a  deformation based
              methodology for the evaluation and  strengthening of existing structures.  This
              methodology is  intended to (1) permit an assessment of the expected seismic 
              performance of existing structures and the identification of  basic
              strengthening needs, (2) facilitate the development of  an effective
              strengthening scheme and provide target values  for the required strength and
              deformation capacities of the  components of the strengthening scheme, (3)
              permit a  verification of the seismic performance of the strengthened 
              structure and provide information for fine-tuning of the  elements of the
              strengthening scheme, and (4) provide  information on the deformation demands
              that will govern  requirements for detailing of the elements of the 
              strengthening scheme.    There have been knowledge gaps in deformation base 
              evaluation/strengthening which reflects the physical  phenomena that control
              seismic performance and this research  is intended to fill most of these gaps. 
              Research is  conducted on the following three topics:  (1) Quantification  of
              seismic strength and displacement demands for Single-  Degree-of-Freedom and
              Multiple-Degree-Of-Freedom systems,  (2) development of procedures and criteria
              for the execution  and evaluation of a "push-over" analysis that is to be 
              employed as part of the evaluation/verification process, and  (3) formalization
              of the concepts of the deformation method  to the extent that it can become a
              feasible and attractive  tool for the engineering profession.    A successful
              completion of  this research will make it  possible to implement an approach to
              repairing and  strengthening of seismically vulnerable structures.  It 
              represents a unique opportunity to advance the state of the  practice and
              introduce deformation control as an accepted  part of the design process.   
              This is an award under NSF-Initiative "Repair and   Rehabilitation Research for
              Seismic Resistance of  Structures."  ***
