Abstract    :
              This award provides funding for a workshop to convene experts and  scientists to
              assess the unique needs educators have for the rapid  prototyping of integrated
              circuits and to suggest potential  solutions for continuously improving the
              state-of-the-art in U.S.  universities.  User data indicates that in some cases
              resources are  not being used in the most effective manner.  This workshop
              focuses  on the prototyping facilities offered by MOSIS and how these 
              facilities can be most effectively utilized by the education  community.  The
              workshop discusses and makes recommendations in the  areas of:  new
              technologies; design methodologies; testing; and  policies, procedures, and
              information dissemination.  Invited  participants from universities, government
              agencies, and industry  seek to determine how universities can improve their
              capabilities  in the rapid prototyping of integrated circuits.  A report will
              be  produced and distributed to microelectronics educators as well as  selected
              government and industry leaders.
