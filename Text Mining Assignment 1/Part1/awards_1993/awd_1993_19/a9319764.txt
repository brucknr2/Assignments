Abstract    :
              9319764 Yao          The American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) proposes to
              conduct, during FY 1994 96, a cooperatively funded Education Improvement
              Project, including an Evaluation, three Workshops, a Conference, and
              preparation of Reports to disseminate findings, relative to past, current, and
              future changes in education affecting civil engineering and related
              specialties/disciplines.  The project will have the following purposes:        
               1.  ` `    Evaluate the outcomes of recommendations made over the past fifteen
              years at ASCE education conferences.          2.  ` `    Prepare a Baseline
              Assessment and Evaluation Report, communicating the findings to the
              organizations funding this Project and to participants in the Workshops and
              Conference described below, for their use during deliberations.          3.  `
              `    Conduct Workshops on curriculum innovation, quality management, and the
              interface between education and practice, bringing together limited numbers of
              highly qualified practitioners and educators so as to:            ` `    o     
                 Review, evaluate and improve the civil (and civil related) engineering
              curriculum.            ` `    o         Propose strategies to strengthen
              interaction among educators, students, and practitioners.            ` `    o  
                    Forecast characteristics of civil engineering leaders of the future and
              suggest ways to educate young engineers in developing these characteristics.   
                      ` `    o          Review and evaluate the potential for a continuous
              quality improvement process within civil engineering education.            ` ` 
                o         Propose alternative strategies for implementation of
              recommendations.          4.  ` `    Prepare a workshop report, an "Agenda for
              Implementation," highlighting key issues and presenting alternatives, options,
              and implementation strategies, so as to provide the funding organizations with
              insightful evaluations of current proposals in engineering education, while
              also facilitating discussion by a larger audience at the subsequent Conference.
                       5.  ` `    Conduct a National Conference, (funding for which is not
              part of this proposal), using the deliberations and reports above, which will
              bring together a large number of leaders in civil engineering education, from
              both academia and practice, to learn, advise, and subsequently assist in
              implementing the alternatives and options under discussion.          6.  ` `   
              Prepare and disseminate widely a succinct concluding Project Report and
              Implementation Strategies, with recommendations and alternative implementation
              strategies. ***
