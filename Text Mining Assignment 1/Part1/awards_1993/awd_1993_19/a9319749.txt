Abstract    :
                   A principal objective of  this mathematical sciences project  is  the 
              development  of  methods for the  systematic  design  of  feedback  laws 
              leading  to the ability to  shape,  or  at  least  influence,  the  steady 
              state  response  of  systems  exhibiting  complex  dynamical behavior. In
              particular, the research  program  focuses  on  feedback design methods for
              problems  of  asymptotic  tracking,  disturbance  rejection,  and  output 
              regulation   for  nonlinear distributed parameter systems.          A  primary
              objective of  this mathematical sciences project  is  the  development of a
              methodology to systematically   control  or  influence  nonlinear effects which
               arise  in  a  variety  of  physical  phenomena.  This goal is motivated  in
              part by problems  in  combustion  control,  where nonlinear  effects  actually 
              can  improve  mixing and hence can , in principle, improve the  engine 
              performance of automobiles, for example. Another example of   the  potential
              impact of nonlinear control in flluid flow problems  is  in  the  control  of 
              instabilities in aerodynamic  applications,  which  have been experimentally
              shown to greatly influence  stall  and  lift  behavior of aircraft and which
              are known  to  lead  to  reduction   in   the  life  cycle  of  aircraft  
              parts.    Other  applications are to active noise control of various devises,
              such  as compressors.
