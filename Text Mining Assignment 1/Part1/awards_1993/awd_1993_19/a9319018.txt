Abstract    :
              This award is for support for a program of borehole studies to  resolve
              fundamental questions about the mechanisms responsible for  the rapid movement
              (~1 m per day) of the West Antarctic ice stream.   Basal "lubrication" by
              deformation of soft glacial till underlying  the ice is often given as the
              mechanism responsible for this rapid  movement, however, efforts to observe
              this bed deformation directly  by measurements in boreholes drilled to the bed
              have not given a  definite indication of it.  Borehole observations have shown
              that  soft subglacial till is present and that physical conditions favor 
              either till-deformation or basal-sliding as the rapid-flow  mechanism. 
              Improved borehole techniques for measuring separately  the basal-sliding
              component of ice movement and the bed-deformation  component will be developed
              and should help to provide insight into  what controls ice stream motion.
