Abstract    :
              9319339  Bielak  The 1985 Mexico earthquake focused attention on the
              amplification  of strong ground motions when propagating from bedrock through 
              the overlying sedimentary deposits.  Similar situations may exist  with regard
              to major cities in the United States, such as with  the Los Angeles basin.   
              The main objective of this research program is to investigate, by  computer
              simulation, the effect of the shape of the bottom of the  basin, as defined by
              the bedrock-sedimentary layer boundary, on  the spatial and temporal
              distribution of surface ground motion  during earthquakes.  Practically all
              studies to date have  considered the bottom of a basin to be concave.  A recent
               scientific article suggests that a bottom surface which includes  both concave
              and convex sections can cause ground surface motions  which are chaotic.  The
              effect of such a chaotic motion on the  level of ground motion experienced by
              engineered structures is  unknown, but it is likely to be beneficial.  This
              will be  explored in the context of two-dimensional sedimentary valleys 
              subjected to seismic excitation in the form of incident plane SH  waves. 
              Parametric studies will determine the difference in the  surface ground motion
              above a convex bottom surface as compared  to that above the usual concave
              shape.    This study will also consider whether small changes in valley 
              geometry and seismic excitation, such as the angle of incidence  of the
              incoming wave, can produce significant changes in the  spatial and temporal
              distribution of the valley response.  Such  large variations would have
              important implications for seismic  hazard assessment and the seismic design of
              structures.    ***
