Abstract    :
              9319128  Bechtel    A combination of theoretical and experimental research is to
              be  carried out to determine certain properties of liquids, such as  surface
              tension and extensional viscosity, which are relevant to  very rapid changes in
              manufacturing and materials processing.  These dynamic, process-dependent
              properties will be extracted  from an inverse method built on a theoretical
              model which  predicts the shape of a free liquid jet as a function of liquid 
              properties. This predictive direct model has been developed by  the
              investigators and is to be extended into the non-Newtonian  regime and
              inverted.    Liquid properties are normally determined rheologically under 
              equilibrium conditions, which often are not relevant to a  rapidly changing
              process environment. The present method  overcomes this limitation.     ***
