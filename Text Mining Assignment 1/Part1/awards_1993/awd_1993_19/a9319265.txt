Abstract    :
              9319265  HINTZMAN    This project will study how information is retrieved from
              human memory; it will focus on the detailed time course of retrieval of
              different kinds of information about single items in memory.  The experiments
              will require people to make a dichotomous decision about a test item (a word or
              picture); the method will manipulate the amount of time the person is allowed
              before being required to make a response.  By varying that amount of time, it
              is possible to determine the earliest point in the retrieval episode at which
              an individual's decision accuracy rises above chance (the intercept).  Previous
              research has suggested that different kinds of information may be characterized
              by different intercepts, in the range of 300-550 ms.  These experiments will
              explore intercepts for a range of memory-based judgments, including judgments
              of generic information (knowledge acquired before the experiment began) and
              episodic information (acquired in the experimental context).  They will also
              examine effects on intercepts of such fundamental experimental variables as
              repetition, recency, and similarity.  The research will include the development
              of computer simulation models, as an aid in interpreting the results.  The
              findings will help shape theories of memory systems, memory representation,
              retrieval, and memory-based decision making, and thereby contribute more
              generally to our understanding of the role of memory in cognition.  The work
              should contribute in the long run to applications in such areas as education
              and training, brain damage and amnesia, and biases in human judgment and
              decision making.    ***
