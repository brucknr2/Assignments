Abstract    :
                During development, the brain must lay down an incredibly  complex system of
              connections between nerve cells that  number in the billions.  Central issues
              for this development  include how nerve cells are directed to form proper 
              connections, and to what extent nerve cell activity is  necessary for
              connections to form normally.  The visual  system of mammals has been
              extensively studied to approach  these issues, and the basic wiring patterns
              are well known.  This project uses an important area, called the lateral 
              geniculate nucleus, where the fibers of the optic nerve in  the eye terminate
              on cells that project to the visual  cortex.  Electrophysiological recordings,
              optical recordings  using special dyes, and pharmacological manipulations will 
              be used to explore how cellular activity, and in particular  activity
              correlated among particular cells, is important  during prenatal development
              before full vision is  established.  Results will be important for
              understanding  how functioning of nerve cells is important to establishing 
              connections, and forming a bridge between a systems-level  description of
              mammalian visual development and the  formulation of cellular mechanisms to
              account for the  process of activity-dependent development.  The results may 
              have important applicability in understanding the changes  that occur in
              learning and memory, as well as being  important for developmental biology and
              sensory  neuroscience.
