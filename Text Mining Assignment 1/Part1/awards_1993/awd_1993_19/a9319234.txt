Abstract    :
              9319234  Campbell  Accurate thermodynamic information about adsorption processes
               is essential to developing a mechanistic understanding of  surface reactions. 
              This information is not available, for the  most part, for adsorption of
              reactive molecular species on well  characterized solid surfaces.  This
              research project, supported  in the Analytical and Suface Chemistry Program, is
              designed to  obtain this sort of information for a number of catalytically 
              important systems.  This information will be obtained by  careful
              microcalorimetry measurements on well characterized  thin metal and metal oxide
              single crystal specimens under ultra  high vacuum conditions.  The work will
              emphasize systems which  can not be studied by more traditional methods such as
              thermal  desorption spectroscopy.  Detailed information about adsorption  bond
              strengths, and the effect of surface structure and  composition on these
              thermodynamic properties will be obtained.  %%%  A basic understanding of the
              strength of bonding between an  adsorbed molecule and a catalytic surface is
              needed in order to  develop and probe reaction mechanisms for these
              technologically  important processes.  This research project is designed to 
              develop and apply a technique for the direct measurement of  this adsorption
              strength on well characterized catalytic  surfaces.  The thermodynamic
              information obtained will be very  useful for evaluating possible surface
              reaction mechanisms and  developing a basic understanding of catalytically
              important  processes.  ***
