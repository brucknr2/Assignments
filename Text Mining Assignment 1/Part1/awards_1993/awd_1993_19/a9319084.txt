Abstract    :
              9319084  Poon  It is proposed to study the electronic properties of a new class
              of  metallic alloys that exhibits non-metallic behavior ranging from  that of a
              semimetal to semiconductor to insulator.  Chemically  designed icosahedral and
              decagonal quasicrystalline alloys, as well  as crystalline alloys of high
              structural quality and thermal  stability, will be synthesized and measured in
              order to evaluate  the effects of quasiperiodicity and strength of atomic
              potential on  the electronic and optical properties.  Experiments to be
              performed  include magneto-transport, heat capacity, thermopower, optical 
              conductivity, NMR, x-ray spectroscopy, and neutron scattering.   Several of
              these studies will be performed jointly with other  groups.  Other goals of the
              study will be to understand the bandgap  and nature of localized and itinerant
              states in these novel  metallic alloys, as well as to explore possible new
              electronic and  magnetic phenomena in these materials.  %%%  The electronic
              alloys to be studied are new and unusual in the  sense that they are
              semiconductors and insulators composed entirely  of elemental metals, in
              contrast to the traditionally studied  covalent or ionic non-metals such as
              silicon and gallium arsenide.   Some of these materials have structures not
              describable by text-  book crystallography; the atoms in these solids order in
              a "quasi-  periodic fashion, hence the name quasi-crystal.  Because of their 
              quasi-crystallinity, a number of novel physical properties have  been predicted
              and these will be investigated in this proposal.   Current commercial
              applications of quasicrystalline materials are  where materials are required
              which have low sticking coefficients,  have a high thermal stability and have
              low surface sticking  coefficients.  ***
