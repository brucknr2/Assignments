Abstract    :
              9319086  Lau       This award provides partial support for a conference on 
              wavelets and fractals to be held at the University of Pittsburgh,  May 20-22,
              1994.  The conference will present studies on various  aspects and connections
              of wavelets and fractals; wavelet  decomposition, reconstruction and sampling
              of functions and  fractal measures; existence and regularity of the two-scale 
              dilation equations; self-similarity in harmonic analysis;  multifractal
              structure of measures and multi-dimensional wavelets  and self-similar tilings.
                     Wavelets is a recently new development in the  mathematical area of
              harmonic analysis.  It combines traditional  Hilbert space methods with new
              constructions of bases from  dilations and translations of a single function
              (the wavelet).   In addition to computational advantages in this approach, it
              has  been found that wavelets can be found which are local in both  time and
              frequency making their application to signal processing  particularly
              effective.   ***
