Abstract    :
              9319139  Schmidt       It has been shown recently that nucleic acid molecules
              can  fold into a variety of shapes, capable of specific interaction with  small
              molecule or protein ligands.  This application proposes to  synthesize a
              complex population of RNA species from a library of  DNA templates containing
              approximately 10 (exp13) random sequences.   The RNAs will be selected by
              affinity to a column-bound RNA stem-  loop structure.  RNA species recognizing
              the stem-loop ("aptamers")  will be eluted from the column, reverse
              transcribed, amplified, and  re-selected to obtain a population of high
              affinity to the stem-  loop.  The domain (epitope) recognized by selected
              aptamer(s) will  be determined.  The successful completion of this research
              will  allow the development of an RNA-based "immunochemistry" capable of 
              recognizing homologous or analogous three-dimensional structures in  RNA, much
              as conventional antibodies recognize structures in other  molecules.  This
              would be valuable, since RNA is a poor antigen in  vivo.  %%%  RNA molecules
              function in part by assuming three-dimensional  structures in solution.  In an
              effort to develop new tools for  analyzing RNA three-dimensional structure, RNA
              molecules will be  selected which recognize the three-dimensional structures of
              other  RNAs.  Eventually, RNAs will be tested for their ability to  recognize
              structurally similar domains in two RNA enzymes which are  hypothesized to have
              similar three-dimensional (tertiary)  structures even though they do not have
              obvious primary sequence  similarities.  ***
