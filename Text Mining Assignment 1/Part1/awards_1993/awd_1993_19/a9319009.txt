Abstract    :
              Jahn  9319009  The proposed experiments aim to understand how chromatin
              structural  changes influence in DNA rearrangements during macronuclear 
              development and include the following.  The timing of replication, 
              transcription and appearance of major histone and non-histone  proteins will be
              determined by labeling studies.  Chromatin  proteins whose synthesis and
              deposition in the developing  macronucleus correlate with excision will be
              identified.   Relationships to Tec excision will be determined by nuclease 
              digestion to identify alterations in the Tec element chromatin  structure.  The
              extrachromosomal circular forms of Tec elements  will be purified as chromatin
              to determine whether proteins  involved in excision remain associated. 
              Specific non-nucleosomal  protein interactions will be further identified by
              footprinting.  %%%  Ciliated protozoa contain two types of nuclei, the
              micronucleus  which serves as a transcriptionally inert germline nucleus and
              the  macronucleus which transcriptionally directs cell functions.  A  variety
              of DNA rearrangements and DNA processing events are  involved in the formation
              of the macronuclear genome from the  micronuclear genome during the sexual
              phase of the ciliate life  cycle. This project has as its goal an understanding
              of how  chromatin structural changes influence the DNA rearrangements  during
              macronuclear development.  ***
