Abstract    :
              9319623  Sehgal    All organisms display biological rhythms that are controlled 
              by endogenous clocks.  These endogenous oscillators often  have a period of 
              about 24 hours, i.e. they are "circadian",  and they control important
              functions such as sleep-wake  cycles, maintenance of body temperature, and
              secretion of  hormones.    In this proposal Dr. Sehgal will investigate the
              molecular  mechanisms underlying rhythmic behavior.  The organism  studied will
              be the fruit fly, where genetic technology has  already been used to dissect
              some components of the  circadian clock.  One regulator of activity rhythms in
              the  fruit fly is the period (per) gene.  When this gene  undergoes mutation,
              the period of circadian rhythms may  lengthen, shorten or even be abolished. 
              Dr. Sehgal's group  will study a gene called timeless (tim) which appears to 
              operate by influencing the products of the per gene.  A  combinmation of
              molecular biological and genetic methods  will be used to isolate and
              characterize tim and to  determine how it interacts with per.    Recent
              findings suggest that genes such as per are present  in the brains of many
              animals.  Therefore studying per and  tim in this system may yield important
              insights into the  molecular architecture of the clock that times all living 
              organisms.***
