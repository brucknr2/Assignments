Abstract    :
              Howard Reiss is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and   Computational
              Chemistry program to continue his theoretical research in   the area of
              vapor-phase nucleation.  He will extend and improve his   "modified liquid drop
              model" for nucleation in several ways in an attempt   to develop a fully
              molecular rate theory for this important process.     Although the theory has
              provided excellent agreement with experimental   data on nucleation of Argon,
              it needs to be extended to more complex   systems for further verification.  
              Reiss will develop a suitable   intermolecular potential for treating carbon
              tetrachloride which will   provide a more challenging test of the theory. 
              Computer simulations   using Monte Carlo methods will accompany the theoretical
              developments,   and attempts will be made to improve existing density
              functional theories   for nucleation which have been developed by others.   
              Nucleation is an extremely important physical process which has   implications
              in the area of weather modification and environmental   remediation.  At the
              current time there is no fully molecular "first   principles" theory for
              predicting the rate of such processes.  The   research being performed by Reiss
              is a first and significant step in the   direction of such a theoretical
              development.
