Abstract    :
              9319807  Cochrane  The large question that drives four fifths of this proposal
              is,  "what are the underlying sources of macroeconomic risks?" Asset  returns
              are sensitive indicators of macroeconomic events, and so  are used to help
              uncover the important risks. There are four  segments to the project.    1) An
              investigation of how firms alter their production plans to  take account of
              risk. With this information, we can use firm  behavior to understand the link
              between stock returns and  economic fluctuations. For example, if market prices
              of oil-  related stocks are high, firms ought to "insure" against oil  price
              shocks by investing in machinery that is easily convertible  to other fuels.   
              2) Tests of linear factor models. A toolkit of simple techniques  will be
              developed for assessing standard asset pricing models,  with a special focus on
              models that capture macroeconomic sources  of risk.    3) Historical asset
              prices. Stock market data will be  investigated back to 1700 on a few British
              companies, focusing on  what happened to their returns through centuries of
              wars,  government financing crunches and real fluctuations.    4) Real business
              cycles and asset prices. To date, standard  models of business cycles generate
              predictions for stock prices  that are just way off the mark. These models will
              be modified to  incorporate interesting and realistic stock price behavior.   
              5) An unrelated project: Time-consistent health insurance. Can  private health
              insurance contracts be structured so that no one  is denied coverage, or is
              "job-locked". The answer is "yes." and  this research describes and discusses
              practical implementation of  such contracts.  ***
