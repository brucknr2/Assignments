Abstract    :
              9319505  Collins  Carnegie Mellon Univ.  Dr. Terrence J. Collins, Chemistry
              Department, Carnegie  Mellon University, is supported by the Inorganic,
              Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program for  research into the
              development and chemistry of stable high valent mid- and late- transition metal
              complexes. Through ligand modification, alkane soluble oxidants will be
              prepared. A series of water soluble or polymer attached high valent cobalt,
              copper, and nickel oxidants will be developed as potential replacements for
              commercially used, but toxic, Cr(VI) reagents. As there is evidence that Cr(V)
              will induce DNA damage, the role of this species as a carcinogen and mutagen
              will be evaluated. Finally, a  series of Cu(IV) and Ni(IV) complexes will be
              developed as two electron reductant and the feasibility of producing Cu(V) and
              Ni(V) species will be explored.  A wide variety of oxidants, compounds which
              transfer one or more electrons to another species in a chemical reaction, are
              used routinely in all areas of chemistry. In this project new oxidants will be
              developed which will be more efficient, easier to use, and environmentally more
              friendly than the ones which are currently employed. As chromium is commonly
              used in oxidations, the interactions of DNA with one important form of this
              element will be evaluated. Overall this project will contribute to design of
              new reagents which are easier to use, not as toxic, and less polluting than
              those which are now being used.
