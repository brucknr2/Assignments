Abstract    :
              9319949  University of Texas-Austin  Thomas F. Edgar      ABSTRACT    The
              purpose of this award is to help support travel costs and registration fees of
              academic participants from the United States at two international conferences
              on control and computer-aided process design, modeling, and manufacturing. 
              These meetings are ADCHEM '94 (Kyoto, Japan) and PSE '94 (Kyongju, Korea) to be
              held on successive weeks at the end of May and beginning of June in 1994. 
              Twenty four U. S. academic program participants will receive a minimum
              allocation of $500, with travel support also going to other U.S. faculty and,
              particularly, young faculty.  A maximum of 40 academic researchers will receive
              assistance with support increasing proportionately if fewer letters of
              application are submitted to Professor Thomas Edgar at the University of Texas.
               Advertisements are to announce the availability of travel grants after both
              conference programs are finalized.    Process control in the chemical industry
              helps to ensure consistent product quality and to reduce production costs so
              that this sector of American industry and others which depend on the chemical
              industry may be more economically competitive.        `        IBMDOS  COM'
