Abstract    :
              9319517  Linker    The investigators will study the stability and evolution of 
              magnetic arcades on the sun that can lead to coronal mass ejections  (CME's). 
              CME's provide a spectacular manifestation of solar  activity.  The plasma and
              magnetic flux ejected into the solar wind  by CME's subsequently interacts with
              the Earth's magnetic field to  produce geomagnetic disturbances.  The
              underlying mechanism which  is responsible for the initiation of CME's is not
              well understood.   The investigators will continue a line of research that they
              have  conducted over the past three years by studying the effect of 
              photospheric shear flows on 2-D and 3-D helmet streamers.  They  will also
              consider the  effect of shear on 3-D arcades and 3-D  helmet streamers.  They
              will develop a model of coronal magnetic  fields based on observed fields and
              direct comparison between  theory and white-light coronal observations.  The
              main emphasis  will be to investigate the stability and evolution of more 
              realistic magnetic field configurations.  ***
