Abstract    :
              9319062  Rosenberg  Montana  Dr. Edward Rosenberg, Chemistry Department,
              University of Montana, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and
              Organometallic Chemistry Program  for research into the chemistry of
              trimetallia clusters. These studies will address fundamental questions relating
              to the types of molecular transformations which occur when more than one metal
              is involved in ligand activation. Specific topics to be investigated are: (1)
              the mechanism by which triosmium clusters promote low temperature
              transamination, (2) the regio-reactivity and reaction kinetics of   a number of
              reactions of imidoyl complexes, (3) the aqueous coordination chemistry
              trimetallic clusters, and (4) the mechanism of metal-ligand hydrogen transfer
              reactions in polynuclear hydride complexes.     Many important chemical
              processes are facilitated by the use of metal catalysts. In order to
              understand, and improve, such catalysts the ways in which chemical species
              interact with metals  must be known. This project aims at determining the types
              of transformations which are possible when a small molecule interacts with two
              or more metal atoms. These will serve as models for the complex transformations
              which occur in a number of metal catalyzed reactions.
