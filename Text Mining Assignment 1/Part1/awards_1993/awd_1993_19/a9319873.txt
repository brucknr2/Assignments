Abstract    :
              9319873  Lingle  This award is for support of a small grant for exploratory
              research  (SGER) to measure surface velocities on Bering Glacier, Alaska,  with
              synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery, which began surging  between March and
              June, 1993.  Use of satellite imagery is an  appropriate approach to this
              problem because of the scale of Bering  Glacier, which is the largest in North
              America, with width and  length dimensions of about 15 km and 200 km,
              respectively, and a  total area, including tributaries of about 5,800 km2.  The
              results  of this work will bear on the questions of (i) the seasonal timing  of
              the onset and cessation of glacier surges in Alaska and the  Yukon Territory,
              (ii) whether surges necessarily begin in accumu-  lation areas then propagate
              downstream into ablation areas, and  (iii) the temporal evolution of the
              2-dimensional surface velocity  field, which is a reflection of basal
              processes, as the surge  progresses.  ***
