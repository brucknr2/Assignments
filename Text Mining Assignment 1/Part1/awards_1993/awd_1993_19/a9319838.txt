                                       9319838 Bahram Shahrooz This project conducts basic
              research examining fundamental behavior of structures employing mixed steel
              concrete construction which has been lagging.  The existing knowledge base,
              particularly for seismic performance of a large class of mixed constructions
              needs to be expanded before comprehensive design provisions can be established
              to advance engineering practice.  Concrete walls or cores have been frequently
              coupled by steel beams, and steel perimeter frames are commonly attached to
              central concrete cores through outrigger beams.  A major concern is the
              transfer of forces from steel coupling beams or outrigger beams into the walls
              or cores, particularly beyond the serviceability limit state.  An experimental
              and analytical study of the fundamental seismic performance of concrete walls
              coupled through steel or composite beams is undertaken.  The experimental phase
              of the research includes testing of six isolated connections representing half
              scale subassemblies.  The specimens comprise a portion of a reinforced concrete
              wall and stub steel beams (either encased or unencased) simulating one half of
              a coupling beam.  The parameters that will be investigated include:  (a)
              effects of construction joints above and below coupling beams; (b) boundary
              element transverse reinforcement in the connection region; (c) addition of face
              bearing plates to the coupling beam as an effort to mobilize      h)         
              0*0*0*         compression struts in the connection region; (d) philosophies
              for sizing steel coupling beams, i.e. design as link beams in eccentrically
              braced frames or as "regular flexural" members such that web yielding will be
              prevented prior to development of plastic moment capacity; (e) performance of
              encased versus unencased steel coupling beams; and (f) requirements for
              preventing premature flange and web buckling.  The pr oject will provide basic
              input for developing appropriate design model and  seismic guidelines for such
              coupled structural systems.
