Abstract    :
              In this project, supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry  Program, a
              method for the characterization of ligand binding  systems using a continuous
              affinity distribution will be developed.   A local solution to the adsorption
              integral equation is used to  calculate proton affinity distributions for high
              surface area oxide  materials.  A detailed knowledge of proton binding sites
              and  distributions will be useful for the a priori design and synthesis  of
              oxide supported metal catalysts.  This methodology should also  find use in the
              characterization of various complex  substrate/liquid interfaces, including
              systems encountered in  immunology, drug design, and the transport and
              sequestering of  metals in aquatic and soil systems.    The very complex
              solid/liquid interface environment will be  examined in the research of this
              project.  A method for the  quantitative description of the adsorption of
              protons on complex  oxide substrates will be developed, which will allow the de
              novo  design of oxide supported catalysts.  If this work, supported  by the
              Chemistry Division, is fully successful, the approach should  also impact
              environmentally important areas such as heavy metal and  halocarbon transport
              in soil and aquatic systems.  A more complete  understanding of the complex
              liquid/solid interface should result  from this work.
