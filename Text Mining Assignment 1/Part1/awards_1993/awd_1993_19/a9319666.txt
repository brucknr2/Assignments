Abstract    :
              9319666  Ackerman  This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and 
              Facilities Program will assist the Department of Chemistry at  Washington
              University in the purchase of a modern replacement  console and
              reverse-detection probe for an existing 300 MHz  multinuclear NMR Spectrometer.
               This equipment will be used in  the following areas of research:  (1)
              Synthetic Ribozymes,  Hydrolytic Chemical Nucleases, and Catalytic Antisense
              Agents  for the Control of Gene Expression; (2) Extended Organic  Chemistry and
              the Study of Highly Reactive Intermediates,  Frontier Orbital Control of Very
              Fast Reactions, Gas-Phase  Rearrangements of Germylenes, New Routes to
              Stannylenes, and  the Molecular Design of Triplet Silylenes, Germylenes, and 
              Stannylenes; (3) Synthesis and Reactivity of Aromatic  Metallacycles; and (4)
              Solution-Phase Materials Processing.    Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)
              spectroscopy is the most  powerful tool available to chemists for the
              elucidation of the  structure of molecules.  It is used to identify unknown 
              substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within  molecules, and
              to study the dynamics of interactions between  molecules in solution.  Access
              to state-of-the-art NMR  spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying
              out  frontier research.
