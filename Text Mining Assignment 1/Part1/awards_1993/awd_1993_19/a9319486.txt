Abstract    :
                    9319486  Zeigler    It is a major challenge to the study of brain and
              behavior  to understand how complex movements are generated, and  further, to
              understand how the control systems for movement  are put in place during an
              organisms development.  Grasping  in the pigeon is functionally analogous to
              the prehensile  behavior of humans, but is mediated by a somewhat simpler 
              neuromotor system -- the jaw.   Dr. Zeigler's group will  examine the ontogeny
              of grasping  behavior in pigeons and  determine its relation to the development
              of the orosensory  tactile system of the jaw.  These studies will greatly 
              expand current ideas about how sensory information is used  to guide movement. 
               The findings will have significance for  our understanding of the evolution of
              neural control, and  have practical payoffs by identifying control strategies
              for  the guidance of motoric systems.  ***
