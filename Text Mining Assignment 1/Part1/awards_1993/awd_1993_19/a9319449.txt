Abstract    :
              9319449  Bishop    Recent studies have shown that cells within the brain do not 
              always respond in the same way to a particular stimulus.  One factor which
              determines how brain cells respond is  chemicals that are released from special
              fibers that  modulate ongoing signaling.  One of these chemicals is  called
              serotonin.  The intent of this study is to determine  the anatomical
              organization and physiological effects of  serotonin on cells located in the
              mammalian cerebellum,  which is a part of the brain that is essential for 
              coordinating movement.  Deficiencies in levels of serotonin  have been
              implicated in several movement disorders.  We must  first define the basic
              organization and mechanisms of action  of serotonin  in cerebellar circuits
              before we can  understand how deficiencies can cause disorganization of 
              movement.    ***
