Abstract    :
              9319332  ANDERSON  This award supports a workshop on shallow stratigraphic
              drilling on  the continental margin of the Antarctic Peninsula.  The workshop 
              will focus on identification of drilling targets for pre-  Pleistocene climate
              and glacial records, particularly in areas of  the Weddell Sea which might
              yield early Tertiary cores that would  record the transition of the region from
              mid to high latitudes.  It  will also address technical problems associated
              with penetrating  the cohesive Pleistocene till so that shallow drilling on the
               continental margin can reach older stratigraphic records.  This is  a major
              technical problem that limits or prevents recovery of  stratigraphic records by
              pistons cores.  Resolution of this  technical problem is very important to the
              acquisition of better  and more complete records of the climatic and glacial
              history of  the Antarctic.  ***
