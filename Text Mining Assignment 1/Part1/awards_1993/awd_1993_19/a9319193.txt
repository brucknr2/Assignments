Abstract    :
                    ABSTRACT    P.I. John Fleagle  SBR-9319193    The origins of monkeys and
              apes in Africa are not well understood.  The best finds for the earliest
              "higher primates" come from Egypt (the Fayum Depression) during the Oligocene,
              but they are very primitive indeed, and may well not lead to the clearly
              "African" monkey and ape fossils that appear about 10 million years later, from
              the Miocene deposits across East Africa.      This Exploratory Grant in
              Anthropological Research will examine very promising sediments in northern
              Kenya, on the northern edge of East Africa, from the Oligocene and Miocene
              period.  It is very likely they will find primate and mammalian fossils
              connecting the times and geographic areas already known, and may well
              dramatically change our understanding of those ancestral forms leading to the
              flourescence of monkeys and apes in Africa.    ***  P\anthro\jfried\9319193.abs
