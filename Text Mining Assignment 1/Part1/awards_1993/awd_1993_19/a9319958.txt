Abstract    :
              In this project of the Experimental Physical  Chemistry Program in the  
              Chemistry Division, Prof. D.H. Levy of the Chemistry Department of the  
              University of Chicago will conduct a series of investigations on the  
              photochemistry of molecules and weakly bound molecular complexes of  
              biochemical interest.   Studies of van der Waals systems involving   complexes
              of  amino tetrazine, proton transfer reactions in organic   dimers, and
              investigations of porphyrin dimers will be undertaken.    The   structures of
              amino acids and peptides in the gaseous phase, the charge   and energy transfer
              in bi-chromophoric molecules, and laser desorption of   fragile organic
              molecules will be investigated by spectroscopic   techniques.      The
              underlying goal of this research program is to obtain a better   understanding
              of the  properties of large biomolcules.  The relationship   between the
              structure and function of biomolcules is to be determined   through the
              spectroscopic investigations of simple amino acids, peptides   and other
              building blocks of  the larger  biomolecular complexes.  Not   only the
              structures, but also the rate at which protons can transfer from   one molecule
              to another, as well as the rate at which electric charge and   energy move or
              are localized within a complex are also important for this   understanding . 
              Special techniques are being developed to vaporize    weakly bound biomolecular
              complexes without at the same time dissociating   them into their component
              molecules.
