Abstract    :
              9319656  Green    Central to the mechanisms that underlie central nervous system
              function are the different neurotransmitter receptors responsible for the rapid
              signaling between neurons and between nerve and muscle.  These different
              neurotransmitter receptors are membrane proteins composed of several subunits,
              which are structurally similar and form a single large molecular family.  While
              much is known about how these receptors function, little is known about how the
              subunits fold into the correct conformation and assemble together to form the
              receptors.  To address these questions, the research will focus on the best
              characterized member of this receptor family, the nicotinic acetylcholine
              receptor.  A series of experiments will identify specific chemical processes
              that are part of subunit assembly and identify specific regions on the subunits
              responsible for interactions between subunits.    ***
