Abstract    :
              9318003  Power     This project investigates the effect of stream   disturbance
              on the length of aquatic food chains.    Ecological theory indicates that food
              chains should be   shortened by disturbance, but preliminary observations  
              suggest that periodic winter scouring in northern California   rivers may
              actually lengthen food chains.  The interplay of   disturbance and trophic
              dynamics is investigated by   laboratory trials to establish susceptibility of
              key   invertebrate taxa to predation, field experiments to assess   the effect
              of disturbance on the strength of species   interactions and of artificial
              scouring on the benthos and   feeding rates of predatory fish, and field
              surveys comparing   the trophic structure of regulated (low disturbance) and  
              natural (high-disturbance) rivers.    %%%  This research is important for
              several reasons.  First, this   is an ideal system for testing (and revising)
              fundamental   theories on the stucture of food webs and the role of  
              disturbance in community structure.  The results of this   study have important
              implications for the effects of dam-  release schedules and flood control
              projects on the   biodiversity and community ecology of rivers.  Results from  
              this research will provide important information for stream   and river
              management and restoration.  ***
