Abstract    :
              9319760  Jayaram  The third Austin Spring Meeting addresses the genetics and 
              biochemistry of intra-cellular communication and intra- and extra-  cellular
              signal transduction in prokaryotes, yeast, and higher  organisms.  The central
              theme is the role of the  phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cascades that
              regulate the  pathways of information processing.  Unifying principles among
              the  diverse systems dealt with will be elaborated.   The meeting will  have
              about 20 invited speakers.  In addition, about 25 young  faculty, postdoctoral,
              graduate and undergraduate students from  areas outside of Austin will
              participate.  The meeting will be  small enough to foster strong interactions
              among the conferees.  %%%  This meeting is on an important topic in cell and
              molecular  biology.  In addition, it will benefit young scientists and 
              students whose attendance will be supported.  ***
