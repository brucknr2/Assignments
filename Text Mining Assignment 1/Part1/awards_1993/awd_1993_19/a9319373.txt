Abstract    :
              9319373  Cooper    The  goal  of  this  work is to understand  how  the 
              connections between nerve cells (call synapses) in the  visual cortex  of  the
              brain  change  during  maturation  from  newborn to adult.  Dr. Cooper has
              developed a theory  that during  the critical period in development when the 
              brain must receive visual input  to develop  properly, it is  a  change  in 
              the  neuronal circuits  with the brain that  is critical for proper 
              development rather than changes in  the properties of the synapses,  as  has
              been  proposed by  others. The experiments that will  be  done  by this  team 
              of  investigators will  test  this  theory by doing  experiments on neurons in 
              in vitro brain slices  from  rat  visual cortex at different times during
              development and from  rats raised in  different visual environments.  If this 
              theory is proven to be true, the work outlined  in  this  proposal will change
              significantly the way in which we view  the developing brain.
