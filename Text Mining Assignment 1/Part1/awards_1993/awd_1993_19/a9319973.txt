              9319973  Gollub    Technical Abstract:    This program of experimental research
              is aimed at extending their  understanding of nonlinear phenomena involving
              macroscopic  interfacial patterns.  First, statistical methods will be used to 
              gain a deeper understanding of disordered patterns that are  evolving
              chaotically in time.  Physical systems to be investigated  include interfacial
              waves and liquid crystal layers.  Second, the  dynamics and defects of
              quasicrystalline patterns patterns will be  studied in a fluid system where the
              various excitations, e.g.  phasons, can be studied directly by optical imaging.
               Finally, the  dynamics of crack patterns and networks in polymeric films will
              be  investigated as time allows.  This RUI project involves the pairing  of
              graduate and undergraduate researchers, which has been shown to  be a
              remarkably effective training strategy.      NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT:    This
              program of experimental research is aimed at understanding the  ordered and
              disordered patterns that arise via instability as a  fluid or solid is driven
              away from equilibrium.  Systems to be  studied include waves on fluid
              interfaces, flows in liquid  crystals, and cracking patterns in polymeric
              materials.  Complex  and chaotic dynamics generally prevent exact prediction of
              the  pattern development, but a statistical approach can lead to limited  but
              useful predictability.  The methodology involves significant  technological
              innovation, mainly centered on digital analysis of  complex patterns.  This RUI
              project involves the pairing of  graduate and undergraduate researchers, which
              has been shown to be  a remarkably effective training strategy.  ***
