Abstract    :
              9319221  Molnia  This award is for support of a six month Small Grant for
              Explor-  atory Research (SGER) to document and analyze a surge, which is in 
              progress, on the Bering Glacier in Alaska.  Surging is defined as  periodic,
              very rapid movements of large quantities of ice within a  glacier, alternating
              with much longer periods of near stagnation.   The Bering Glacier is the
              longest (191 kilometers) and largest  (5,173.5 square kilometers) glacier in
              North America.  This work is  part of an on-going program of the United States
              Geological Survey  to monitor the Bering Glacier (the Bering Glacier Research
              Project  (BGRP)) and involves analysis of synthetic aperture radar imagery, 
              vertical aerial photography, time-lapse photography, and stream  gauge
              monitoring.  ***
