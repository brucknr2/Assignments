Abstract    :
                                             ABSTRACT    CHE-9319400                PI:
              Trogler                Inst: U of Cal San Diego      With this grant, the
              Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program supports 
              research on reactions of carbon disulfide and carbonyl sulfide relevant to
              their behavior in the  atmospheric sulfur cycle by Dr. William C. Trogler of
              the Chemistry Department, University  of California at San Diego.  Photoinduced
              oxidation with molecular oxygen, solution hydrolysis  reactions including
              photochemistry, and catalytic oxidation by metal oxide components of  aerosols
              will be investigated.    Carbonyl sulfide, a regulated emission product, is an
              impurity in refinery and synthesis gas  which can cause technical problems as a
              catalyst poison.  Carbon disulfide is a neurotoxic  byproduct of the production
              of rayon and carbon black.  The fundamental chemistry of these  atmospheric
              gases will be better characterized in order to understand the atmospheric
              sulfur  cycle.  In addition, their role in the production of stratospheric
              sulfate aerosols, which effect  solar reflectivity and have been linked to
              global ozone depletion, will be examined.
