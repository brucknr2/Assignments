Abstract    :
                                          Abstract  9319068  Fritts  This project will measure
              the dynamics of the mesosphere and lower  thermosphere (MLT) at high time and
              spatial resolution (2 minutes  and 2 kilometers) using two medium frequency
              (MF) radars.  The  first radar will be built near McMurdo and the second either
              at  Palmer Station or, if it is logistically more convenient, at the  nearby
              Peruvian station on King George Island.  These instruments  will allow detailed
              studies of large and small scale motion fields  and their latitudinal and
              temporal variability.  When the data are  compared to similar products from
              Northern Hemisphere radars it  will be possible to study inter-hemispheric
              differences in the  behavior of the MLT, which preliminary studies indicate are
              quite  substantial.  ***
