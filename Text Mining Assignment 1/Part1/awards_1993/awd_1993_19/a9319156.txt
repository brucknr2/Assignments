              Abstract  ATM-9319156  Stahle, David W.  Cleveland, Malcolm K.  University of
              Arkansas  Title: Denchronology in East Africa    Tree-ring chronologies are a
              proven paleoclimatic proxy in the  middle latitudes where winter temperatures
              include the formation of  unequivocally annual growth rings in many species of
              trees.  The  absence of strong temperature seasonality has severely constrained
               the application of denchronology to tropical forests.   Nevertheless, there
              are a number of climatic mechanisms in the  tropics (seasonal precipitation)
              which can induce seasonal growth  rhythms in trees.  This award supports an
              international  collaboration in East Africa to develop dendrochronologic 
              techniques for paleoclimatic reconstruction in tropical regions.
