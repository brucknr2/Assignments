Abstract    :
              9319344  Rollag    Exposure of cultured Xenopus tailfin melanophores to light
              causes  intracellular pigment granules to migrate from a homogeneous 
              cytoplasmic distribution to a perinuclear aggregate.  This direct  photic
              response, which is independent of the visual system,  provides a convenient
              model system for study of the mechanisms by  which light directly modifies
              cellular function.  The proposed  research will identify molecular components
              of the  phototransduction pathway in cultured melanophores, compare the 
              molecular cascades elicited by light and melatonin (a hormone which  causes
              similar morphological changes), and define experimental  paradigms that induce
              the photosensitive phenotype.   Immunocytochemical, molecular biological,
              radioimmunochemical, and  videomicroscopic techniques will be employed.  It is
              expected that  this research will 1) provide an important precedent for 
              understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying extra-retinal  photoreception
              in vertebrate cells (a biological response that is  not only used during
              camouflage, but also for regulation of  seasonal reproductive phenomena in a
              variety of vertebrate  species), 2) expand upon the use of the amphibian
              melanophore as a  model system for study of the molecular mechanism of both
              melatonin  and light signal transduction, and 3) provide a method for reliably 
              inducing the photosensitive phenotype in nonphotosensitive  melanophores (a
              necessary preliminary to studies that seek to  determine the chemical identity
              of photosensitizing inductive  factors and their mechanisms of action).  ***
