Abstract    :
                The processes extending from nerve cells are called axons and  dendrites. 
              Dendrites receive messages from other cells, while the  axon conducts messages
              often over long distances.  Compared to  axons, we know far less about
              dendrites, and little about how the  distinctions between the two arise during
              development.  This  project extends studies on the molecular identity of a
              compound  believed to be a protein that appears to act specifically as a 
              dendrite-promoting factor.  A novel neuronal culture system has  been
              established to test the effects of this compound on isolated  growing cells. 
              Microscopic analysis of cells along with protein  chemistry will be used to
              assay and isolate the purified molecule.   The purification of such a unique
              factor will have a great impact  on developmental neuroscience, and the
              potential opportunity for  further biotechnological development of such a
              product is very  high.
