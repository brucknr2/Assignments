                                        ABSTRACT                                  Rayner, J.T.
               9319039    This project will construct a 0.9-5.5 um medium cross-  dispersed
              spectrograph for use as a facility instrument at  the 3-meter NASA Infrared
              Telescope Facility (IRTF) on Mauna  Kea.  In conjunction with a fast tip-tilt
              secondary at the  IRTF, the spectrograph will accommodate 0.25-0.30" images at 
              1-2.5 um and diffraction-limited a spectral resolution of  R=1200, through a
              0.3"x5" slit.  The instrument will use a  512x512 Insb focal plane array.  The
              major innovation in  this instrument over existing spectrographs is the 
              capability of observing over the entire near infrared range  at high
              sensitivity and at very high angular resolution,  making it an ideal instrument
              for a number of key  astronomical projects.  These include spectroscopic
              surveys  of small bodies in the solar system to enhance studies of  how our
              solar system formed, spectroscopic surveys of young  stellar objects in the
              most nearby molecular clouds to probe  sites of possible planet formation,
              spectroscopic surveys of  star forming regions to spectrally type young
              embedded stars  to provide new insights into star formation, investigation  of
              galaxy formation and early evolution, and distinguishing  starbursts and
              monsters in powerful infrared galaxies.  ***
