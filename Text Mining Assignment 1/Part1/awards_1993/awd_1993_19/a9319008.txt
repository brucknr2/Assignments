Abstract    :
              9319008  Sheehan    This research is a collaborative investigation between the 
              University of  Colorado and the University of Nevada-Reno.  It is  an
              integrated study of the lithospheric  structure of the western  United States,
              extending from the Great Basin of Nevada to the High   Plains of Kansas.  The
              project will involve both analysis of  existing seismic data and a field 
              experiment to collect three-  component broadband seismic data in the Colorado
              Plateau and   eastern Basin and Range.  The shear velocity structure of these 
              regions will be examined  through combined analyses of teleseismic  receiver
              functions and surface waves, and through  examination of  shear-wave splitting
              of teleseismic S phases.  The analysis will  include gravity  and topography
              data in order to investigate the  dynamics and buoyancy of the region, possible
               mantle flow, and  transitions between the various physiographic provinces.
