Abstract    :
                      9319970  Klypin         This is a grant for theoretical research of the
              formation of  various types of astronomical objects in modern cosmological 
              models.  The main goal is to make detailed theoretical predictions  for objects
              and structures for a very wide range of scales and to  confront these
              predictions with observational data.  Basically all  possible cosmologically
              relevant scales will be considered:  from  the fluctuations of the microwave
              background, which probe scales  larger then, say 100 Mpc, to superclusters and
              clusters of galaxies  on 10-100 Mpc scales to galaxy clustering at 1-10 Mpc and
              to  submegaparsec scales, which are important for the epoch of galaxy 
              formation.  Comprehensive analysis of cosmological models and  confrontation of
              the models with observational results, which also  cover a vast range of sizes
              and different types of objects, are the  key points of the research.
