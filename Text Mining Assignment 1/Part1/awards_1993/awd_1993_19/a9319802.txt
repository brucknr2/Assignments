Abstract    :
              9319802  Nanni      This  project  will investigate the feasibility of using 
              several  different types of fibers to increase the ductility of the  group 
              acting as a pretressing strands for use in concrete construction.  The  carbon 
              fiber  may also be used as a monitor  for  permanent  damage  in  the concrete.
               Fibers to be considered are:   carbon,  aramid,  and  poly-vinyl-alchol,
              because they are stable  in  the  alkaline environment of the concrete.  ***
