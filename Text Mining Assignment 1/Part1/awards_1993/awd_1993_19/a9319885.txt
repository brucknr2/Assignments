Abstract    :
              9319885  Rao  Al, B, N, and P ion implantation will be performed in both bulk
              crystals and epitaxial layers of 6h({SYMBOL 97 \f "Symbol"})-SiC and 3C({SYMBOL
              98 \f "Symbol"})-SiC.  For each ion, variable energy and variable dose implants
              will be performed.  By analyzing the implant secondary ion mass spectrometry
              (SIMS) depth profiles in the as-implanted material, the first four moments of
              the implant depth distribution will be determined at various ion energies. 
              Using these experimentally determined moments, the implant profile will be
              reconstructed using Pearson-IV distribution and compared with the actual SIMS
              profiles.  Following annealing the redistribution of the implant will be
              checked by SIMS measurements and then the material will be thoroughly
              characterized.  To obtain high resistance regions required for interdevice
              isolation, 200 keV O+ compensation implants of various doses, accompanied by
              isochronal anneals will be tried in both n- and p- SiC of various
              conductivities.  Using the  optimum implantation/annealing conditions developed
              in this work, high-temperature/high-power p-n junction rectifiers, blue LEDs,
              and JFETs will be made SiC.    B and P ion implantations will also be performed
              into GexSi1-x alloy layers grown on (100) Si for x values in the range 0.1 to
              0.4.  The implanted material will be annealed in a halogen lamp RTA station and
              then characterized by using various techniques as mentioned above for SiC.   
              The proposed work will be performed in collaboration with the scientist at
              Naval Research Laboratory, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, National Institute of
              Standards and Technology and General Electric Research Center (Schnectady).
