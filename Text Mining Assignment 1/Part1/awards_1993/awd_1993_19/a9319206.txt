Abstract    :
              9319206  Borst    Crustaceans are economically important animals, both as 
              fishery products and as fouling agents of marine structures.  The research
              described in this application will study  hormones that affect the growth and
              reproduction of these  animals.  One such hormone is methyl farnesoate (MF), a 
              crustacean compound related to juvenile hormone, an  important regulator of
              insect growth and reproduction.  The  goal of this research is to identify
              those factors that  regulate MF production in crustaceans.  The isolation and 
              characterization of these compounds will allow us to better  understand the
              processes regulating crustacean growth and  reproduction, and may yield
              products useful in the  stimulation and/or inhibition of growth by these
              organisms.  ***
