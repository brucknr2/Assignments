Abstract    :
              9319892  DeSzoeke    The dynamics of the oceanic surface layer in the western
              Pacific  warm pool region will be investigated by means of comparing 
              observations with various parameterization of mixed layer dynamics  and a
              simplified ocean circulation model.  The main focus will be  on the effects of
              rainfall on the upper ocean response to  atmospheric forcing.  This study is a
              contribution to TOGA COARE  (Tropical Ocean Global Atmosphere Coupled Ocean
              Atmosphere Response  Experiment).
