Abstract    :
              9319928  Roberts    Living cells regularly cycle through periods of mitotic 
              activity, and recent work has suggested that this is related  to the rhythmic
              association between members of two protein  families that control the division
              process.  Interestingly,  members of these protein families have been found in
              a  tissue whose cells no longer divide:  the brain.    In this proposal Dr.
              Michael Roberts will attempt to  determine the function of these proteins in
              nervous tissue.  Dr. Roberts will test the hypothesis that circadian rhythms 
              (changes in physiological functions that have a cycle with  approximately a 24
              hour period) are generated by periodic  interactions between the same proteins
              that otherwise  regulate cell division.  The experiments will be conducted  on
              a circadian pacemaker in the marine mollusk, Bulla.  In  this model system,
              correlated physiological and biochemical  information can be obtained and the
              results should allow us  to understand the control of endogenous rhythms in a
              wide  range of living organisms.
