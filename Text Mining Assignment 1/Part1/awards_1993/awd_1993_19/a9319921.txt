Abstract    :
                    9319921  SEYFRIT  Rapid  social  and  economic changes have taken place 
              throughout  rural   Alaska,  but  relatively  little  research  has   focused 
              specifically on how these changes affect adolescents  whose  life  changes and
              beliefs about their future foreshadow the destiny  of  many  Arctic villages.
              This project is a longitudinal study based  on  the Northwest Alaska Borough,
              site of a large zinc mine,  and  the  Bristol  Bay area, where commercial
              fishing  dominates.  The  project systematically explores the progression from
              High  School  expectations  to post-High School experiences. The data  will  be
               based  on  surveys as well as ethnographic fieldwork, interviews,  employment,
               police  and  native association  records.  The  data  collected will help test
              the relationship between intentions  and  behavior,  describe  connections
              between  individual  and  social  changes   in  a  rapidly  transforming 
              environment,  and   yield  practical  insights  for  those  involved  in 
              education,  social  services  and  occupational training for Native youths  in 
              rural  Alaska.  ***
