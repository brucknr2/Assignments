Abstract    :
              9319827  Van Olst    The striped bass aquaculture industry currently is
              dependent on springtime capture and spawning of wild fish for fry production
              and subsequent pond culture of fingerlings.  Determination of the biological
              requirements needed to spawn domesticated striped bass year-round and to raise
              fingerlings in intensive tank culture systems is a key issue to the expansion
              of the striped bass culture industry.  The proposed research will focus on 1)
              defining the biological cures of photoperiod, temperature, and hormonal
              treatments needed to induce spawning in adult broodstock, and 2) developing the
              techniques necessary to raise striped bass from fry to fingerling stage in
              tanks without using ponds.  ***
