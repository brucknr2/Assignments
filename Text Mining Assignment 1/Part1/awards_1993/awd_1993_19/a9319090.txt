Abstract    :
              9319090  Pederson  Montgomery College requests support from NSF for connection
              of  their campus networks to SURAnet.  SURAnet is the midlevel  network located
              in the southeastern United States.  It will  provide operations management and
              information services and it  will give Montgomery College a 56 thousand bits
              per second  connection to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per 
              second) National Backbone network.    The college has experienced a growth in
              auxiliary programs that  has added value to the basic mission that the college
              serves to  aid the education of all persons of all ages.  The networking  plan
              at Montgomery College is the foundation for uniting all the  disciplines and
              campus groups.
