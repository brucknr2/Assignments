Abstract    :
              9319944        NOLAN   This award supports a 3-day meeting of  45 recent Ph.D.
              recipients and doctoral students in statistics and probability.  The purpose of
              the meeting is to facilitate the exchange of research ideas among new
              researchers in diverse areas of statistics and probability and to assist in the
              professional development of new researchers.  Those attending will actively
              participate in the program by either presenting their research in a short talk
              or in a poster.  The program also includes overview talks on cutting-edge
              research and a panel discussion on how to initiate an active research program,
              where senior researchers will have an opportunity to shape the research
              potential of these new members of the mathematics community.  The conference is
              to be held prior to the joint annual meeting of the IMS and American
              Statistical Association (ASA) in August, 1993.  Conference attendees will be
              encouraged to participate in workshops held on writing skills, the professional
              development of new women researchers, and special topic workshops in
              probability and genetics held the weekend between this conference and the
              annual meetings of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics.
