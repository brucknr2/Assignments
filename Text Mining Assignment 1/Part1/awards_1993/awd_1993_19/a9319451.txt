Abstract    :
              9319451  Magasanik  This U.S.-Mexico award will support a workshop on 
              integrative approaches to molecular biology.  The  organizers are  Professor
              Boris Magasanik of MIT and  Professor Julio Collado of the Center for Research
              on  Nitrogen Fixation in Cuernavaca, Mexico.  The workshop  intends to bring
              together experimentalists and  theoreticians from the U.S., Mexico, Canada, and
               Europe to discuss the possibility of an integrated  approach to current and
              future problems in molecular  biology.    As progress in the field of molecular
              biology  continues, there is need for more integrated  approaches that will
              permit better use of increasing  data and results.  In this context, the
              workshop will  include discussions of artificial intelligence and  genome
              projects, theoretical and experimental  approaches to gene regulation,
              metabolism and  integration in bacteria, protein analysis, and  evolution.  An
              expected outcome will be a monograph  containing the discussions and
              conclusions of the  meeting.  ***
