Abstract    :
              9319634  Pickard    Living organism possess internal biological clocks that
              control the  timing of many different biological processes.  Jet lag, ability
              to  concentrate, the way you respond to anesthesia are all affected by  daily
              or seasonal biological cycles.  Organisms isolated without  exposure to
              day:night cycles or other environmental time cues  continue to express rhythmic
              processes but with a period only  approximating 24 hours.  One striking
              day/night rhythmicity is the  synthesis and secretion of the hormone melatonin
              by the pineal  gland.  While it is clear that the pineal gland plays a major
              role  in the control of circadian activity rhythms, a major question is 
              whether single isolated cells also exhibit these 24 hour circadian 
              oscillations.  Dr. Pickard is establishing the technology to  accurately detect
              rhythmic fluctuations in hormone secretion from  single cells.  Using an in
              vitro preparation of dissociated pineal  cells in short-term culture, he is
              developing a reverse hemolytic  plaque assay to measure melatonin secretion in
              single isolated  cells.  This technology will enable Dr. Pickard to detect
              rhythmic  hormone secretion in the attamol range (10-18mol).  With this level 
              of sensitivity, he will establish the procedures to sequentially  assay
              melatonin secretion from the same isolated cells, thus  providing an answer to
              one of the major fundamental questions  regarding the organization of
              biological clocks.  ***
