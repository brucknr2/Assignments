Abstract    :
              9319246  Haydock  This is a proposal based generically on the elctronic
              structure of  disordered materials; the disorder may be glassy, it may be in
              the  form of a disordered overlayer or it may simply be the presence of  a
              surface.  Tight binding techniques will be used to examine these  systems
              implemented primarily via the recursion method. ( 1) In  glassy systems like
              amorphous graphitic carbon, the validity of an  approximately conserved
              momentum-like quantum number, resulting  from the preservation of local
              real-space order, will be studied.  (2) The reason why metal atoms randomly
              distributed on a  semiconductor surface produce metallic contacts at low
              surface  coverage (and the degree of localization with coverage) will be 
              studied.  (3) The linear and non-linear collective response of  electrons to
              external fields (both above and below the plasmon  threshold) at metal surfaces
              will be studied to understand the  anisotropy of second harmonic generation. 
              %%%  This is a numerically intensive proposal to study several aspects  of
              disorder in solids.  The disorder may be at the level of glassy  3D structure;
              at the level of randomly placed atoms on an otherwise  ordered crystalline
              semiconductor substrate; or even at the level  of the presence of a surface in
              an crystal. In the first case, the  project looks for certain spectroscopic
              invariants due to the  glassy structure.  In the second case, the work involves
              explaining  why metal atoms deposited at low coverages on a semiconductor 
              surface give rise to conductivity.  And in the third case, the work  tries to
              understand why systems which we expect to be very  isotropic have a very
              anisotropic response when their surfaces  scatter externally impinging laser
              light.  ***
