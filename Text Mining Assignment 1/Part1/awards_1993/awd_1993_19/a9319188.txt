Abstract    :
              9319188   Alperin            This award supports research on a number of
              different  directions in group representation theory.  The principle 
              investigator will apply results which are consequences of recent  discoveries
              in topology to representation theory in work on block  equivalences.  He will
              also study the representation theory of  finite groups of Lie type using
              algebraic varieties and new ideas  associated with the complexity theory of
              modules from homological  representation theory.  Finally, he will continue his
              study of  Hecke algebras and study the blocks of such algebras with ideas  from
              the representation theory of algebras.         The research supported concerns
              the representation theory of  finite groups.  A group is an algebraic object
              used to study  transformations.  Because of this, groups are a fundamental tool
               in physics, chemistry and computer science as well as  mathematics. 
              Representation theory is an important method for  determining the structure of
              groups.
