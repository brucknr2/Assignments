Abstract    :
              9319808  Pindyck  This project consists of two parts.  The purpose of the first
              is  to extend the investigator's recent work on irreversible  investment
              decisions under uncertainty.  The second part involves  applying the ideas and
              methods developed in the first part to the  analysis and design of
              environmental policy in the presence of  irreversibilities.  Models will be
              developed that combine both  economic uncertainty and ecological uncertainty
              with two kinds of  irreversibilities that are often inherent in the adoption of
              an  environmental policy.  The first kind of irreversibility is the  sunk cost
              to society resulting from the environmental regulations  themselves.  The
              second is the sunk benefit in the form of  avoided environmental degradation
              that also results from the  regulations.  The goal of this activity is to apply
              the models to  the analysis of policies directed at the problem of global 
              warming.  ***
