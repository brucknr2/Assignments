Abstract    :
              9319436  Rous  A comprehensive theoretical description of resonance electron 
              scattering by molecules adsorbed on solid surfaces will be  developed and
              applied to understand the fundamental physics of  negative ion formation at
              surfaces.  The computational methodology  will be based upon the
              layer-Kohn-Korringa-Rostoker theory which  will fully incorporate the multiple
              scattering of the trapped  electron by the substrate and surface barrier.  Thus
              the influence  of the unoccupied electronic structure of the substrate on the 
              molecular resonance will be modelled.  The dependence of resonance  lifetime
              and energy upon the molecular adsorption height (above the  surface),
              adsorption site and molecular orientation will be  explored in order to
              elucidate the link between the adsorption  geometry of a molecule and the
              behavior of the transient  (resonance) state.  %%%  In a variety of electron
              and photon stimulated surface dynamical  processes, short lived "resonance"
              electronic states localized  mainly upon the adsorbed molecule are known to be
              important.  The  proposed work concerns itself with characterizing both the
              energy  of these states and their lifetime via computationally intensive 
              methodologies.  The work will concentrate on how the presence of  the nearby
              surface affects the resonance states of the free-space  molecule and, further,
              how these states vary as a function of the  location and orientation of the
              molecule relative to the surface.  ***
