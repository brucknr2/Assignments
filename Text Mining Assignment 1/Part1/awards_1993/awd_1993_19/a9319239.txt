Abstract    :
              9319239  Johansen  An advanced research optical microscope fitted for 
              differential interference contrast will be used in the study  of the structure
              of diatoms, a study of the ecology of algal  communities in four Lake Erie
              estuaries, genetic and  developmental biology studies of C. elegans, and
              systematic  studies of fishes using early ontogeny of the Weberian  apparatus
              and visceral arches in cyprinids.  The instrument  will be used for faculty and
              student research in an  institution dedicated to undergraduate and
              masters-level  education.
