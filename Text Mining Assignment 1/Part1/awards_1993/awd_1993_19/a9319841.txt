Abstract    :
                  9319841  Tung  The project is concerned with the design and construction of 
              break-away walls in buildings located in flood prone coastal  areas.  The
              behavior and strength of connections joining the  walls panels to buildings and
              the panels themselves will be  studied through experiments.  The results of
              these tests will be  analyzed and a model will be developed for computing the
              response  of the wall/building system to prescribe wind and water induced 
              loads.  A method for assessing the forces acting on the break-  away walls, and
              the response and failure mode of the walls will  also be developed.  The
              knowledge generated by the study will  increase the safety of coastal area's
              population and will benefit  the economy of these areas.  ***
