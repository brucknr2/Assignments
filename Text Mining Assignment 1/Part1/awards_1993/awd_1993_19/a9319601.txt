Abstract    :
              9319601  Lee    Humans can learn complex movement skills that involve 
              coordination of the entire body.  This project will study  three aspects of how
              the brain learns to coordinate a  complex action that requires standing human
              subjects to pull  accurately on a handle without losing balance.  The 
              horizontal body motions of individuals skilled at this  motion resemble those
              of an inverted pendulum controlled by  an elastic cord and a pulley.  First it
              will be determined  how subjects learn this pendulum - like coordination and if
               the pendulum model fits vertical body motion as well.  Second, it will be
              determined whether the stiffness of the  body (like the elasticity of the cord)
              decreases with  learning, and if so, whether decreased stiffness is due to 
              lower simultaneous activation of agonist and antagonist  muscles in the arms,
              legs and trunk.  Third, it will be  determined if the number of independently -
              moving joints  increases with learning, and how the brain alters muscle 
              activity patterns to mediate changes in joint movement.  The  results of this
              study will provide a basis of later studies  of the brain structures that
              contribute to the learning of  coordination.
