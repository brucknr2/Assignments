Abstract    :
              9319962  Doyle  Dirhodium(II) catalysts that possess bridging chiral  
              carboxamide ligands will be developed for highly   enantioselective metal
              carbene and other chemical   transformations. The development of effective,
              highly   enantioselective catalysts for metal carbene reactions of  
              diazoketones, for aziridination, for Lewis acid-promoted   reactions, and for
              hydroboration will be undertaken. New   polymer-supported chiral dirhodium(II)
              catalysts will be   prepared, and attention will be directed to increasing  
              catalyst turnover numbers beyond 1000. The major goal of   this project will be
              the synthesis of chiral dirhodium(II)   catalysts that have high turnover
              numbers for the formation   of single products that are enantiomerically pure. 
              %%%  This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the   continuing
              work of Professor Michael P. Doyle at Trinity   University. Most biologically
              important molecules possess   regions of chirality or handedness. In other
              words, these   regions are related as ones right hand to ones left hand.   This
              chirality is essential for biological activity. In this   research, chiral
              catalysts which incorporate rhodium will be   prepared and used to carry out
              reactions where the product   of the reaction is chiral. These reactions
              include the   addition of a CH2 unit to a carbon-carbon double bond to   give a
              chiral compound which contains three carbon in a   cyclic array.  ***
