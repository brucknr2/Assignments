              This award provides travel support to allow a number of U.S.  graduate students
              to attend the International Symposium on the Life Cycle of Extratropical
              Cycles, an event marking the 75th anniversary of the publication of the first
              scientific paper dealing with the concept of extratropical frontal cyclones. 
              The symposium will be held in Bergen, Norway, the home of the so called
              Norwegian school of polar front theory.  The students will not only attend the
              sessions and, if appropriate, present papers, but also assist in writing the
              summaries of the sessions. ***
