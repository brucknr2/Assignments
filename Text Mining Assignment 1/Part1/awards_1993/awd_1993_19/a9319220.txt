Abstract    :
              9319220  Cooper  This award supports participation of US investigators in the 
              ANTOSTRAT Symposium which will bring together seismic  stratigraphers,
              sedimentologists, glacial geologists, and  paleontologists to develop a
              state-of-the-art picture of the  continental margin stratigraphy of Antarctica.
               Investigators  sponsored by the United States Antarctic Program have been
              major  contributors to geologic models for the evolution of the Antarctic 
              continental margins.  This symposium is the culmination of  scientific
              collaborations that have been developed under the aegis  of the Scientific
              Committee on Antarctic Research and that have  been realized through several
              ANTOSTRAT Regional Working Groups.   This symposium is expected to produce a
              comprehensive atlas of  seismic stratigraphy accompanied by interpretations of
              the glacial  and marine geology several large segments of the Antarctic 
              continental margin.  ***
