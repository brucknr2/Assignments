Abstract    :
              9319341  Hung    This research project is aimed at a comprehensive investigation
               on the dynamic interaction between a concrete gravity dam and the  reservoir
              during earthquakes when the depth and capacity of the  reservoir are seriously
              altered and reduced by reservoir  sediment.  The dam/reservoir system will be
              further studied when  the effect of foundation rock is included in the
              analysis.  The  sediment will be modeled as a poroelastic medium.  The momentum
               equations for the solid phase in the porous medium and those for  the fluid
              phase will be solved simultaneously with the pressure  wave equations for
              sediment and the impounded water, the  vibration of the dam, and the response
              of the foundation rock.  The effects of sediment thickness, material
              properties, and the  bulk modulus of water will be investigated.  Since the
              inertial  force and the Stokes drag in the sediment have been identified to 
              increase hydrodynamics forces over 50 or 100%, a special  computational
              procedure will be developed and used for dam safety  analysis and design.  ***
