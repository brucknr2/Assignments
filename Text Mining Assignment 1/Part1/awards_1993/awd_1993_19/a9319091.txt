Abstract    :
              9319091  Hwa    The primary purpose of this U.S.-Slovak research project between
               Dr. Rudolph Hwa of the University of Oregon, Eugene, and Dr. Jan  Pisut of
              Comenius University, Bratislava, is to study the  possible formation of
              quark-gluon plasmas in relativistic heavy-  ion collisions.  In doing so, the
              researchers will focus on  describing the pre-equilibrium thermalization
              process in order to  understand: 1) the suppression mechanism causing an
              anomalous  ratio of J particles to Psi particles and 2) dilepton and multi- 
              particle production.  Results are expected to improve our  understanding of
              strong interaction in dense media nuclear  matter.    This project in high
              energy physics fulfills the program  objectives of advancing science by
              enabling leading experts in  the U.S. and Eastern Europe to combine
              complementary talents and  pool research resources in areas of strong mutual
              interest and  competence.
