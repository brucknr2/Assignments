Abstract    :
                 9319153  Zhang    This research studies an approach to perceptual grouping in
               computer vision, using as a basis a theory of position-frequency  analysis. 
              Perceptual grouping organizes local features of an input  image, such as
              pixels, line-segments, and regions, into  perceptually salient structures.
              Successful perceptual grouping can  lead to a drastic reduction of the search
              space and significant  performance improvements for various computer vision and
              image  processing applications, such as object recognition, image  analysis,
              and active vision.  The main difficulty in perceptual  grouping, however, lies
              in the lack of understanding of how  perceptual grouping should be formulated
              as a computational problem  under a proper data representation.     The recent
              success of time-frequency analysis in signal processing  has motivated the use
              of its extension, position-frequency  analysis, in computer vision.
              Position-frequency representations  can be used to model a wide range of image
              features, local and  global.  It also provides new insights on how perceptual
              grouping  can be formulated as a computational problem.  The objectives of 
              this research project are to:    1.) Develop a general mathematical framework
              for perceptual  grouping based on the theory of position-frequency analysis,   
              2.) Investigate a number of fundamental problems in perceptual  grouping using
              this framework and developing grouping algorithms,    3.) Test these algorithms
              in practical (e.g., industrial)  applications.
