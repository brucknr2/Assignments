Abstract    :
                  ABSTRACT -- CTS-9319323  Pitz      The PI has proposed a very ambitious
              experimental program to use non-intrusive laser diagnostic techniques to
              investigate the effects of stretch and flame curvature on the structure and
              extinction of 2D laminar partially premixed flames.  This will be carried out
              in collaboration with Prof. Mitch Smooke of Yale University who will be
              concerned with the numerical modeling of these flames; this latter effort will
              be supported by the Gas Research Institute.  Three flame configurations will be
              investigated: (1) an axisymmetric opposed flow flame in the absence of flame
              curvature, (2) a cylindrical flame undergoing pure curvature, and (3) a
              co-flowing axisymmetric jet undergoing both stretch and curvature.  Effects of
              gas reformation and radiation on the structure and emissions will be studied by
              adding H2 and CO to the methane fuel or infrared radiating gases such as CO2 to
              the fuel or air.  The objective of this experimental investigation is to
              produce a flamelet library of stretched cylindrical and stretched co-flowing
              flames for input to more complex transitional and turbulent flamelet models
              found in practical combustors.
