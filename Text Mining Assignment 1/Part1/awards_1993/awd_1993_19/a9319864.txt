Abstract    :
              9319864  Ashcroft  Theoretical research will be conducted on fluctuational
              physics and  its manifestations in electronic and structural order in both 
              quantal and classical systems. Motivated by experiment, three  research thrusts
              are planned: many-body theory, correlated  classical systems, and electronic
              structure.  Under many-body  theory a fundamental two-component theory of
              condensed matter will  be developed using coherent-state functional integral
              methods.   Under correlated classical systems, a theory of structured matter 
              will be developed which parallels the theory of the homogeneous  counterpart. 
              The electronic structure thrust will examine by both  single-particle and
              many-body methods the range of orderings seen  experimentally in dense
              assemblies of electrons and protons where  fast and slow degrees of freedom in
              a dual fermion system are  evident.  The theories developed will be applied to
              problems of  high current interest such as superconductivity, quasicrystals and
               the metal-insulator transition.  %%%  Theoretical research will be conducted
              on relatively simple models  of many-body systems in order to gain an
              understanding of  fluctuation physics as it arises in order, structure and
              transport.   This work will provide insight into similar behavior in more 
              complex systems.  The research not only addresses fundamental  issues in
              condensed matter physics, but also applies the models  developed to real
              materials of current interest.  ***
