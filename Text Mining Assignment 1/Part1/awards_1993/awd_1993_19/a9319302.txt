Abstract    :
                During development of the brain, nerve cells become organized into  functional
              units for appropriately connected circuits.  Patterns of  layers or clustering
              in the adult brain develop by mechanisms still  unclear.  There is evidence
              from many studies that cell-cell  interactions and extracellular factors such
              as cell adhesion  molecules play a significant role in organizing such regions
              before  the neuronal connections themselves are established.  This project 
              exploits the development of forebrain organization, where novel  molecular
              antibodies have been found to demonstrate formation of a  boundary of the
              region where olfactory inputs terminate.   Experimental manipulations utilize
              the well-established  developmental model system of the frog Xenopus.  Cell
              grafting,  molecular probes for antibodies and gene expression are used to 
              identify the molecules involved and their relative contributions to  defining
              this regional border.  Results will provide an important  basis to proceed with
              analyzing the molecular mechanisms of  boundary formation, and so will be
              important beyond understanding  the development of olfactory circuits to
              understanding the biology  of pattern formation in general.
