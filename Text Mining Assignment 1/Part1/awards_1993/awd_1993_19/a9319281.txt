Abstract    :
              9319281  Goodman       This grant supports the research of a senior faculty
              member,  an Associate Research Scientist and a Postdoctoral Research  Associate
              and students at the University of Maryland.  They, with  colleagues from the
              University of California at Irvine,  University of California at Santa Cruz and
              at the Los Alamos  National Laboratory study characteristics of high energy
              cosmic  rays, especially those produced by primary photons.  The goals  are to
              establish the identity of as yet unknown sources and  explicate still unknown
              acceleration mechanisms.  Those are  subjects of intense current interest and
              activity.  A major  thrust of the program is the development of a new
              air-shower  detector - MILAGRO - makes use of Cerenkov radiation produced by 
              shower particles in a large pool of water.  ***
