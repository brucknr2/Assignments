Abstract    :
              9319166  Dean  This award will provide partial support for the Third Circumpolar
               Symposium on Remote Sensing of Arctic Environments, to be convened  in
              Fairbanks, Alaska, in May 1994.    The symposium will provide a forum for the
              presentation and  discussion of current results of original research in the
              remote  sensing of physical and biological phenomena and processes in the 
              terrestrial and marine polar regions.    The first two symposia, held in 1990
              and 1992, pointed out that  satellite and airborne remote sensing systems are
              one of the most  valuable sources of environmental data for the study of the
              polar  regions.  Since then the successful launching of the ERS-1 and  JERS-1
              satellites is beginning to provide a massive amount of  synthetic aperture
              radar (SAR) data of the polar regions through  the Alaska SAR Facility, located
              on the campus of the University of  Alaska, and has greatly expanded the scope
              of processes that can be  studied remotely.  ***
