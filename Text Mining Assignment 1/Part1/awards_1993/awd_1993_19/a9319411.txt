Abstract    :
              9319411  Mullen       This is a collaborative project between Dr. Steven Mullen
              of  the University of Arizona and Dr. Frederick Sanders (ATM-9318751).   The
              goal is to understand the impact of initial data uncertainty in  short-range
              (1-2 day) and extended range (3-5 day) forecasts of  explosive cyclogenesis. 
              This will be accomplished through  diagnostic studies and forecast experiments.
               Both a global  spectral model and a limited-area mesoscale model will be used
              to  produce model simulations of cyclone cases.  Analyses of observed  cases
              will be examined as well.  In addition, the PIs plan to  conduct Monte-Carlo
              ensemble forecasts to evaluate the efficacy of  this technique in minimizing
              the negative impact of forecast  variability.         Explosive cyclogenesis
              events, whether over land or ocean,  represent potentially dangerous storms in
              terms of both economics  and safety.  The principal investigators hope to
              provide insights  into the most promising ways to improve the forecasts of such
               storms.  ***
