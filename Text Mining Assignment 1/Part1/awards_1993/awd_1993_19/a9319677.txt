Abstract    :
              9319677  Knutson       This project will meet the urgent need for the library 
              communities to identify national policy issues, questions, and  principles in
              the areas of telecommunications and information  infrastructure, and to share
              information on recent projects or work  in progress in the various library
              associations.       A structured policy issue forum (with about forty
              attendees)  will bring together representatives of the American Library 
              Association (ALA) and several other library and related  associations, with
              special attention to representation from all  sizes and types of libraries.  A
              set of principles will be  developed to identify commonalities, to inform and
              guide  associations activities, and to enable individual librarians and 
              libraries to make decision in an informed context.  ***
