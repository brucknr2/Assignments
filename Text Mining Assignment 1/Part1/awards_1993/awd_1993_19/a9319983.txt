Abstract    :
              9319983  Gorman  This project will develop a course module that can be used in a
               wide variety of classes to illustrate how environmental ethics can  be
              integrated into the invention and design process.  The module  will begin with
              a case study of an inventor of solar heating  systems who is motivated both by
              environmental and market concerns.   Students will then be given a chance to
              design their own technology  that meets the criteria of environmentally
              sustainable development;  they will have to evaluate their design both for its
              ecological  soundness and from a practical economic perspective, demonstrating 
              how their technology could be marketed.  Afterwards, students will  analyze and
              compare their own design processes, focusing especially  on the role of ethical
              concerns in making design decisions.  To  determine its effectiveness, this
              module will be piloted and  evaluated in a special course on invention and
              design intended for  students from both engineering and the liberal arts.  It
              will then  be prepared for dissemination to instructors nationwide.  ***
