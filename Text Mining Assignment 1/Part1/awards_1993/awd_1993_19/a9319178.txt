Abstract    :
              9319178  Etkin    The function of many nuclear proteins is regulated by 
              selective nuclear localization.  Xenopus nuclear factor 7  (xnf7), a putative
              transcription factor, is a member of a  novel zinc finger gene family whose
              members consist  primarily of transcription factors and protooncogenes.  Xnf7 
              is first detected in the oocyte nucleus and is retained in  the cytoplasm until
              the mid blastula stage of development  when it reenters the nucleus.  Recent
              evidence showed that a  22 amino acid sequence in xnf7 called the cytoplasmic 
              retention domain (CRD) is required for cytoplasmic retention  prior to the mid
              blastula stage and that phosphorylation of  two sites within the protein is
              necessary for proper CRD  function.  Dr. Etkin's laboratory has shown that xnf7
              is  retained in the cytoplasm through an anchor mechanism most  likely
              involving the tethering to a ctyoplasmic anchor  protein.  The hypothesis being
              tested in this project is  that phosphorylation induces a structural change in
              xnf7  resulting in the binding of the CRD sequence to an anchor  protein.  Dr.
              Etkin will test this hypothesis by  accomplishing the following specific aims: 
              (1) He will  further determine the role of phosphorylation in the  retention of
              xnf7 in the cytoplasm.  (2) He will analyze and  identify the proteins that
              interact with the CRD sequence  and function in cytoplasmic retention of xnf7
              and will clone  the cDNAs for these proteins.  In addition to gaining an 
              insight into an important regulatory process during  amphibian development, the
              analysis of the mechanism of  selective nuclear localization of xnf7 will
              provide  information necessary to understand this phenomenon in other  systems.
