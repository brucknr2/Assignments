Abstract    :
              9319006  Costain    This research is a Small Grant for Exploratory Research that
              is  under the category of "research having a severe urgency with regard  to
              availability of or access to data,...".  Three seismic industry  speculation
              lines, acquired about 20 years ago, SEISDATA 4, 6, and  8, cross the
              Appalachian orogen from the Blue Ridge province,  across the Inner Peidmont,
              the Central Piedmont Suture, Piedmont,  and Atlantic Coastal Plain.  These data
              have never been reprocessed  or published in a format other than line drawings
              of tracings fo  the reflections from brute stacks.  These data apparently 
              disappeared during the last decade and were believed lost.  They  have
              resurfaced once again and a copy can be obtained for  scientific use for a
              fraction of the original cost.  These seismic  data cross important structural
              features on the eastern coast of  the U.S. and extend previous seismic work
              related to an NSF funded  deep core drill hole project, ADCOH.    ***
