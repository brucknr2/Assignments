Abstract    :
              9319597  Beddor                                ABSTRACT    Cross-language data
              on speech production and perception gathered  over the past 25 years show that
              languages may systematically  differ in both coarticulatory patterns and
              perceptual organization.  The central question addressed by this proposal is
              whether language  differences in speech perception are linked to language
              differences  in coarticulatory structure. The specific hypothesis to be tested 
              is that language-specific patterns of coarticulation give rise to  listener
              expectations concerning the acoustic consequences of  coarticulation; such
              expectations in turn lead to language-specific  patterns of perceptual
              accommodation to coarticulated speech. The  cross-language acoustic and
              perceptual data to be collected here  are relevant to theoretical issues in
              speech perception and  language acquisition. Current models of speech
              perception differ in  whether the primatives of perception are auditory events
              or vocal-  tract gestures. A finding that compensatory context effects are 
              language-specific (and in turn linked to language-specific  coarticulatory
              patterns) would constrain possible models. It would  be argued against a purely
              auditory source for these effects, but  also against articulatory-gesture
              approaches which propose that the  acoustic signal provides sufficient
              information for the listener to  disentangle coarticulatory influences.
              Developmental models of  speech perception are more centrally concerned with
              the language-  specific reorganization of initial perceptual capabilities. Even
              if  the specific hypotheses concerning a coarticulation-perception link  are
              not upheld, the data will broaden knowledge of which perceptual  capabilities
              can be modified through linguistic experience and the  nature of the relevant
              experience.  ***
