Abstract    :
              9319726  Butler    This project addresses the use of legacy cost in an
              engineering  context.  Researchers in the business and engineering schools of 
              the University of Missouri have combined forces to address  methods of
              accounting for the costs of such things as pollutants  and physical hazards in
              the design process of innovative  products.***
