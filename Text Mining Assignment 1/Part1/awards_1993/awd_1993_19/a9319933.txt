Abstract    :
                        9319933  Berridge    In this project Dr. Kent Berridge will study how
              a specific  circuit within the brain integrates behavior into  coordinated
              sequences of movement.  This part of the brain,  the striatum, is a "high-level
              modulator"  of action in a  wide range of mammals.  In humans, it may control
              the  sequencing of overt movements, words and thoughts.   Dr.  Berridge will
              study the striatum in rodents, where it  appears to coordinate the sequencing
              of instinctive grooming  movements.    Previous indirect evidence suggested
              that the striatum  allocates control among various lower-level action 
              generating systems.  Presumably, some of these action  systems express
              programmed movements, while others may use  sensory input to guide the form of
              movements.   In the work  proposed here,  Dr. Berridge's group will first map
              the  specific areas of the striatum controlling particular  functions.  Then
              they will use deactivation techniques and  tests of sensorimotor thresholds to
              determine if  the  contribution of the striatum to the sequencing of movement 
              does indeed depend upon modulation of sensory processing.  These results will
              provide a better understanding of how the  brain produces complex behavioral
              sequences.  It may also  provide insights into the nature of the processes that
              are  disturbed in human striatal syndromes characterized by  abnormal sequences
              of movement or thought.  ***
