Abstract    :
                This research investigates a technique which allows  computer  programs to be
              constructed which are more easily and efficiently  tested and which can be
              incorporated into a design methodology  for producing  efficiently testable and
              fault tolerant software  systems.  The  technique is to modify a primary 
              applications program so that, with essentially  negligible  overhead, the
              primary program not only produces its required  output  but also generates
              additional data, referred to as a  ``certification trail.'' The  certification
              trail allows the  correctness of the primary program's output to  be completely
              and  efficiently certified by means of a second, simpler and more  efficiently
              executed program, referred to as a ``certifier'' which  uses the  certification
              trail to also produce the output so that a  subsequent comparison  operation
              can take place.  The relative  simplicity of the certifier has  significant
              advantages beyond  that of speed of execution.  For example, the  certifier
              program  can be formally verified for correctness in cases where doing  so  for
              the primary program is much more complicated --- perhaps  prohibitively  so. 
              In general, this project develops a formal,  theoritical framework for the 
              certification trail technique, as well as for  building upon proof-of-concept
              performance experimentation by means of  implementing the  technique and
              generating performance data for primary programs  implementing a variety of
              well-known algorithms.
