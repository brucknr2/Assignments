Abstract    :
              Cheng  9319817  Abstract  Zebra fish have many advantages as an experimental
              organism for  developmental studies. However, its use is limited unless it can
              be  developed as a genetic system also. It is proposed that this  project will
              demonstrate the feasibility of using zebra fish as  experimental genetic
              organisms. Mutations that increase genomic  instability, e.g. by increasing the
              rate of chromosome loss or  mutation, are expected to increase the frequency of
              loss of  heterozygosity. That loss can be used as a phenotypic screen in  that
              a recessive pigment mutation which can be quantitatively  assessed by screening
              the number of nonpigmented cells in an  otherwise pigmented retinal epithelium
              of three-day old unhatched  embryos can be used as a tracer. The mutant
              candidates can be  generated as the progeny of mutagenized gol-1+ males and
              non-  mutagenized gol-1(b1) females. The recessive mutant screen proposed 
              involves inspection under a dissecting microscope of the progeny.  Clutches of
              progeny yielding a potential aggregate of more than  100,000 cells will be
              scored in situ under a dissecting microscope  at three days. A simpler dominant
              screen will be evaluated in  parallel primarily with males after standard
              crosses.  When  possible, complementation analysis of recessive mutations, 
              outcrosses and quantitation of the effect of mutations will be  begun.   %%% 
              The feasibility of developing zebra fish as useful genetic  organisms will be
              determined. The strains necessary for the  projected screen for mutant progeny
              will be generated. Genomic  instability mutants, both dominant and recessive,
              will be  generated. When possible, the mutants will be characterized and 
              karyotyping will be attempted.  ***
