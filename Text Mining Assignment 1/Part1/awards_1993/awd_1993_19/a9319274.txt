Abstract    :
              9319274   Gajewski  Thermally induced reactions involving 1, 1-, 1, 3-, and 3,  
              3-sigmatropic shifts, polar solvent effects, and additions   to aldehydes will
              be studied. Stereochemistry, deuterium   kinetic isotope effects, and
              temperature dependence will be   used to probe the course of these reactions.
              The 1, 3-shift   study will focus on the vinylcyclopropane rearrangement,  
              isomerizations of alpha-pinene, alkoxy-substituted   vinycyclopropane and
              vinylcyclobutanes, and the   methylenecyclopropane degenerate rearrangement.
              The 3, 3-  shift studies will focus on heteroatom substituted 1,5-  dienes and
              the 1, 1-shift studies will pursue the extent of   double bond rotation in the
              geometric isomerization of   trans-1,2-dideuteriospiropentane. Further
              development of a   multi-parameter equation to correlate solvolysis rates,  
              Claisen rearrangements, and Diels-Alder reactions will be   pursued.
              Nucleophilic additions to aldehydes will be studied   by means of deuterium
              isotope effects in order to determine   the amount of bond formation in the
              transition state.  %%%  This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports
              the   continuing work of Professor Joseph J. Gajewski at Indiana   University.
              The results of this research will provide   fundamental understanding about the
              reaction paths that are   selected in the thermal rearrangement of organic
              molecules.   This is an important topic, since such thermal   rearrangements
              find applications in various areas from   processing of petroleum to synthesis
              of organic molecules.   The intricacies of these reactions will be probed by
              using   deuterium labeled compounds and the unique three-dimensional  
              structure of selected molecules. The effect of solvent on   rates of reactions
              and additions to carbon-oxygen double   bonds will be explored as well.  ***
