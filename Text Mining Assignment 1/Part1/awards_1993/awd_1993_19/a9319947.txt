Abstract    :
              9319947 Ogden  This Americas award will support a group of approximately 25 U.S.
              and Caribbean scientists representing 19 regional marine laboratories, to
              participate in a workshop organized by Professor John Ogden of the University
              of South Florida and collaborators.  The workshop, which will take place in
              Keys Marine Laboratories, Florida, will consider the application of the
              region-wide ecosystem and physical time series measurements being made at
              present, to remote sensing of sea surface temperature and ocean color.  This
              project builds on the Caribbean Coastal Marine Productivity (CARICOMP) program,
              a network of marine laboratories in the Western Tropical Atlantic region,
              developed under the support of UNESCO and NSF and currently supported by the
              MacArthur Foundation. CARICOMP monitors the state of coastal oceans in reef,
              mangrove and seagrass ecosystems.    The present program will promote the
              development of regional ground truth measurements for current and future remote
              sensing capabilities in the U.S. and will develop potential collaborators and
              users of remote sensing data within research institutions in 15 countries
              bordering the Caribbean sea.  The regional data to be developed under this
              project will contribute fundamentally to our understanding of the impact of
              global change on the biologically diverse ecosystems of the tropical coastal
              zone.   ***
