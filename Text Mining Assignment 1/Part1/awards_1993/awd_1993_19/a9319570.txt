Abstract    :
              9319570  SWANN                                ABSTRACT    Recent research
              suggests that people's self-concepts lead them to  behave in ways that make
              their self-concepts very resistant to  change.  For example, people seem to
              prefer and choose  relationship partners who confirm and validate their
              self-views.  This occur seven if their self-views are negative: in one study, 
              married people with negative self-views committed themselves to  spouses who
              held them in low esteem. Their behaviors, then, are  reminiscent of Groucho
              Marz's quip, "I'd never join a club that  would have me as a member." The
              investigators have studied these  processes with emphasis on specifying why
              people with negative  self-views behave as they do. They have also considered
              how these  activities may make it difficult to change people's self-views.  One
              remaining puzzle concerns the conflicted feelings people with  negative
              self-views have about the evaluations they receive. On  the one hand, such
              persons prefer and seek unfavorable  evaluations. Nevertheless,they feel
              terrible when they actually  receive such evaluations! The investigators hope
              to find out why  people with negative self-views routinely behave in ways that 
              generate such ambivalence. They will also try to determine the  conditions
              under which they will break out of such vicious  cycles. This research is
              designed to provide a deeper  understanding of the feelings and thoughts that
              underlie the  self-defeating behaviors of people with negative self-views. As 
              such, it is likely to provide a perspective on these behaviors  that is
              ultimately useful in developing strategies of prevention.
