Abstract    :
              9319455  Arritt       Small lakes are commonplace geographical features.  The 
              atmospheric effects of lakes are important to many practical  problems such as
              water resources, air pollution dispersion and  modification of the local
              microclimate.  There is also evidence  that small lakes can substantially
              affect the development of  daytime convective clouds.  In some cased the lake
              breeze induced  convergence provides a trigger for deep convection while in
              other  cases small lakes have been observed to suppress convective  cloudiness.
               Such effects have implications for feedbacks to the  larger scale weather
              environment.       The objective of this research is to develop a comprehensive
               physical understanding of the atmospheric effects of small lakes.  
              Specifically, the Principal Investigators will study the magnitude  of the
              small lake effects on the atmosphere, the temporal and  spatial extent of such
              effects, and the fundamental physical  processes that produce the measured
              effects.  The Principal  Investigators will use a combination of analytical
              scaling,  numerical simulations and a small, well-focussed observational  study
              to accomplish their objective.  ***
