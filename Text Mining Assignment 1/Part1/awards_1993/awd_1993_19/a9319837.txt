Abstract    :
              9319837  Frances    This is a request for an Individual International Travel
              Grant  to visit several German Universities in February of 1994.  The  goals of
              the trip are the following:  (i) to discuss mutual  exchanges of students
              between Purdue School of Chemical  Engineering and German Universities; and
              (ii) to discuss  research interactions between the universities.  The ultimate 
              target is to involve U.S. undergraduate students for coursework  or research,
              graduate students for coursework or research, and  post-doctoral students. 
              U.S. students are expected to benefit  from the high level of chemistry and
              chemical engineering  education and research in German universities and from
              their  strong industry-university interactions.  Moreover, students  will
              acquire a better international perspective and be better  prepared for tackling
              globalization of U.S. industry.  A  report  will be provided to NSF.  ***
