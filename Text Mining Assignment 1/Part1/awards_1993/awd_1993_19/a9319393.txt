Abstract    :
               Benchmarks have been used to test everything from the speed of a  processor to
              the access time of a memory system.  The computing  community  relies on them
              heavily to assess how fast a given  hardware or software system  operates. 
              They are of fundamental  importance in everyday computing.  However,  up until
              now, the  study of the art of designing a good benchmark has focused on  making
              the benchmark ``realistic'' in predicting how well it will  perform for the 
              intended applications; the issue of making  benchmark results trustworthy has 
              been relegated to ``trusted'' or  third party agents, and little attention has 
              been paid to the  question of making benchmarks themselves ``uncheatable.'' 
              The  project studies the problem of how to make benchmarks resistant  to 
              tampering and hence more trustworthy.  The plan is to use  modern cryptography 
              and complexity theory to make this possible.  Basically the trust in
              individuals  and organizations is replaced by trust in the impossibility of
              breaking  certain  computational problems.  The advantage of this new approach
              is  clear:  the new schemes will be scientifically trustworthy.    There is a
              whole array  of problems that need to be formulated  and solved, which are
              important in  making uncheatable benchmarks;  some are practical issues, some
              are theoretical.
