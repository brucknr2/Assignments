Abstract    :
                    ABSTRACT    P.I. Maryellen Ruvolo  SBR-9319021    The molecular DNA
              sequence data obtained in this study will make several important contributions
              to primate systematics and to our understanding of molecular evolution.     
              First, this study will evaluate several alternative hypotheses about the
              relationships of two major primate groups, the New World and Old World monkeys.
               Combining molecular data from several unlinked gene loci, as this study will
              do, will increase confidence in any emerging molecular consensus phylogeny -
              there are a number of unresolved issues at this level.      Second, this study
              will contribute to an extensive molecular evolutionary survey of a
              mitochondrial gene throughout the mammalian radiation.  This will mean that we
              can analyze the molecular evolution of a mitochondrial gene over a grat time
              depth in diverse organisms, uncovering patterns which might not otherwise be
              ovservable.    Third, this research will study an example of molecular
              adaptation in detail - particularly the rate of increase in the COII gene
              change in higher primates.      Fourth, the research will contribute to testing
              three general theories determining rates of molecular evolution - a) "male
              driven molecular evolution,"  b) the "nucleotide generation hypothesis" of
              mutation rates, and c) the "metabolic rate hypothesis."    The project also has
              a strong training component for young professionals in molecular biology and
              anthropology.  ***  P\anthro\jfried\9319021.abs
