Abstract    :
              9319141  Marwitz       Observations of the atmosphere through remote sensing and
               in-situ measurement are necessary for advancement in atmospheric  science. 
              Instrumented research aircraft have been invaluable in  providing these
              observations over the last four decades.  The need  for such aircraft will be
              great over the next few years for  research covering a broad range of research
              problems including  atmospheric chemistry, mesoscale meteorology and cloud
              physics.  These areas of atmospheric science are high priority research areas 
              for the next decade.       This award makes available to  the entire
              atmospheric sciences  community the University of Wyoming King Air research
              aircraft. The  Wyoming King Air will be treated as all other atmospheric
              sciences  community facilities with allocation being made by an NSF Facility 
              Advisory Council based on a community peer-review process. The  University of
              Wyoming personnel are experienced in airborne  research and the King Air is a
              state-of-the-technology research  platform.  During a previous three year
              award, the University  demonstrated exceptional performance in servicing the
              community  needs.  This award also helps maintain an active program in 
              airborne research at the University of Wyoming and extends this  educational
              benefit to other institutions through emerging  agreements with other
              universities.  The University of Wyoming  produced many excellent airborne
              research scientists over the last  three years.     ***
