Abstract    :
              This award is for support for an airborne radar sounding survey over the central
              and downstream  portions of ice stream D, West Antarctica during the 1995-96
              austral summer field season using the  CASERTZ aerogeophysics  facility.  Ice
              stream D has been selected for study by glaciologists working  on the West
              Antarctic Ice Sheet project as the most appropriate for concentrated study. 
              This radar  suvey is supposed to complement the one being carried out by the
              CASERTZ group in the catchment  area of ice stream D.  By employing the GPS
              navigational control of the CASERTZ facility, high  precision maps of surface
              and bed elevation, ice thickness, and hydrologic potential will be produced.  
              Knowledge of these parameters will lead to a better understanding of the
              dynamics of the ice stream.   The timing of the field work in the second year
              of the award will allow for effective integration of the  CASERTZ system with
              the existing equipment and techniques used by the University of Wisconsin 
              group.
