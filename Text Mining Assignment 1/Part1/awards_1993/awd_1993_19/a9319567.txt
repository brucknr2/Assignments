Abstract    :
              9319567  Weinreich  The present proposal is for work that generally continues
              our  highly successful investigation  of physical phenomena that  underlie the
              functioning of musical instruments, with important  ramifications for vibrating
              systems in general, sound production  and control, wave propagation in
              irregular spaces, computer  modeling, and nonlinear mechanics.  A new feature
              is the emphasis  on the dynamics of the driving mechanism of wind instruments,
              an  example of nonlinear coupling between separate oscillators with  many
              implications for the vibration of systems subject to  nonlinear dynamical laws.
