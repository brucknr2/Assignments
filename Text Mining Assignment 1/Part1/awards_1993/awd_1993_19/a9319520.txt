Abstract    :
              The PIs propose to investigate "decoy effects," which are the influences that a
              new alternative has when it is added to a set of options from which a person
              has to make a choice.  Occasionally such decoys have quite paradoxical effects,
              such as increasing the likelihood of choosing an original member of the set. 
              The investigators will use techniques which assess the information- gathering
              processes used by persons in such decoy effect experiments.  Eye movement
              monitoring will also be done.  A total of twelve experiments are proposed.
