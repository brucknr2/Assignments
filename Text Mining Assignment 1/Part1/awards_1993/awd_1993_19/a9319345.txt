Abstract    :
              9319345  Koch       Mesoscale atmospheric gravity waves can have a significant 
              effect upon the weather.  Cases have been documented where solitary  waves were
              accompanied by localized pressure falls of 11 mb, winds  in excess of 30 m/sec
              and blizzard type conditions.         The first objective of the Principal
              Investigator is to  construct a climatology of mesoscale gravity waves using
              data  collected during the Stormscale-Fronts Experiment, Systems Test.   The
              research will consist of cross spectral and other statistical  analyses to
              reveal the environmental circumstances under which  mesoscale gravity waves
              develop in wintertime baroclinic systems.       The second objective is to use
              a case study approach to  investigate the vertical structure of mesoscale
              gravity waves.  The  evolving wave structure will be related to changes in the 
              surrounding environment, in particular wave ducting properties.    ***
