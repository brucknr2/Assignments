Abstract    :
              Manteuffel            The researcher and his colleagues organize a conference 
              devoted to iterative methods for the solution of linear and  nonlinear systems
              of equations.  Particular themes are  nonsymmetric linear systems, globally
              convergent algorithms for  nonlinear systems, algorithms of optimal order of
              work, and  applications on multiprocessor computer architectures.           
              The mathematical description of real-world problems  leads inevitably to
              equations to solve.  Many times the equations  are nonlinear ones, arising
              because the underlying problem is  nonlinear.  Often, however, the original
              problem is linear and  the mathematical equations are too.  Such problems arise
              in all  areas of science and technology, and are of special interest in 
              biology, materials, environmental studies, and manufacturing.    Progress in
              these areas requires solution of more comprehensive  modeling equations, or
              more accurate solution of existing models.  In either case, these needs
              increase the size of the equations or  their nonlinearity. The conference
              addresses advances in  algorithms to deal with the bigger size of the
              equations,  nonlinearities, the amount of time and work needed to get a 
              solution, and the possible use of multiprocessor computers. ***
