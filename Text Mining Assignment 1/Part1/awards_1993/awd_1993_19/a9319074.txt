Abstract    :
              9319074  Botts   Theoretical studies have argued that the spatial and temporal
              arrangement of habitat patches may have a strong influence on population size
              and persistence in environments that are heterogeneous and/or disturbed. Few
              experimental studies have addressed the interactive effects of spatial
              arrangement and patch age on local population dynamics. In this research, the
              PI's will conduct a set of experiments to determine how the distance between
              patches and patch age influence the abundances and distributions of
              patch-dwelling organisms. The test organisms will be stream invertebrates
              within experimental patches of woody/leafy debris. First, the PI's will
              determine the spatial scale over which fauna potentially can respond to patch
              arrangement by measuring species-specific dispersal distances in the field.
              Next, experiments will be designed to manipulate the distance among patches and
              patch age, followed by monitoring species responses based on population
              abundance and distribution.   %%%   This research is broadly relevant to both
              theoretical and empirical investigations of patch dynamics and it is of
              particular interest to lotic ecologists because it addresses how habitat
              heterogeneity and faunal dispersal in streams interact to ensure population
              persistence in highly variable environments. in addition, this work will
              provide one of the first empirical applications of theoretical models which
              suggest using dispersal ability as a scaling function when studying spatial
              habitat heterogeneity.
