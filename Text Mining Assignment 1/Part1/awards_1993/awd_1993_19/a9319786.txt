Abstract    :
              9319786  Manghnani           The German super-deep continental bore-hole (KTB)
              project  offers an excellent opportunity to study the seismic and 
              petrophysical properties of crustal rocks.  Laboratory studies of  the
              bore-hole samples, combined with field seismic surveys in the  Bavarian
              Oberfalz and well-log data, will enable fine-tuning and  enhancement of
              interpretations of seismic reflection data and other  geophysical signatures in
              terms of the crustal lithology,  composition, microstructure, fabric, and
              presence of pore fluids.         This project involves laboratory studies on
              the frequency,  pore pressure, and temperature dependences of the attenuation 
              properties of the KTB samples which are aimed at securing a vital  linkage in
              interpreting seismic and well-log data.  The results  will also complement
              existing velocity data.  The data to be  collected are essential for
              understanding wave propagation in  intensely foliated and cracked rocks
              encountered in this region.   A systematic study of the attenuation properties
              of KTB samples  from varying depths under simulated in-situ fluid content,
              fluid  pressure, and temperature conditions will help in  relating the 
              laboratory results to subsurface crack modeling and in estimating  in-situ
              stress.  ***
