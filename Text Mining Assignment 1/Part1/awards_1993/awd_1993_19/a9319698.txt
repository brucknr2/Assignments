Abstract    :
              9319698  Humphrey  This award is for support of a Small Grant for Exploratory
              Research  (SGER) to document and analyze a surge, which is in progress, on  the
              Bering Glacier in Alaska.  Surging is defined as periodic, very  rapid
              movements of large quantities of ice within a glacier,  alternating with much
              longer periods of near stagnation.  The  Bering Glacier is the longest (191
              kilometers) and largest (5,173.5  square kilometers) glacier in North America. 
              This study will  monitor the basal hydrology of the surge, by monitoring outlet
               streams that emerge from the glacier at different elevations.   Automated
              observations of water, suspended, and dissolved loads  from glacial outlets
              will monitor the subglacial hydraulics which,  according to present
              understanding, control the propagation of  surges.    ***
