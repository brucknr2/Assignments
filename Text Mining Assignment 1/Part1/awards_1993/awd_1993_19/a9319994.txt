Abstract    :
              9319994  Berliant  The location of consumers, producers and marketplaces is in 
              a state of transition. We need tools, models and conceptual  frameworks to
              address the most important questions  concerning the economic role of cities.
              Why do cities form  where they do? What are the driving forces behind the 
              formation and growth of cities? The answers to these  questions are clearly
              relevant to urban policy decisions,  but before these applications can be made,
              relevant theories  that answer these basic questions must be developed. This 
              research attempts to fill part of this need by extending two  basic models of
              location to the point of obtaining a  conceptual framework for analysis and
              then using this  framework to answer some of the critical questions.The 
              analysis treats prices and quantities of goods produced and  consumed as
              endogenously determined. The endogenous location  of consumers, producers, and
              especially marketplaces will be  highlighted. After obtaining existence of a
              stable  (equilibrium) state of the system and studying its  efficiency
              properties for each model, the work is extended  to analyse the effects of
              changes in policy variables.  The  empirical part of the study uses simulation
              exercises to  find equilibrium for special cases.  ***
