Abstract    :
              9319196  Aronson  The  central  objective of the proposed work is to delineate 
              the  occurrence  and stability of Charge Density Waves (CDWs)  in  the  layered
               rare earth polychalcogenides. This approach  combines  a  synthetic  
              solid-state   chemistry   component   with   physical  measurements  of 
              crystal  structure, electrical  transport,  and  magnetic susceptibility and
              theoretical analyses of observed  and  predicted  structural distortions in the
              CDW  phase.  By  varying  temperature,   pressure,  composition,  and 
              stoichiometry,   the  overall electron count and covalency in this nearly
              isostructural  family  of  compounds can be controlled in a  continuous 
              manner,  accessing  the  complete  range  of  CDW  stability.  Of  central 
              interest  is  the identification and description of compounds  in  which  the 
              CDW  is  marginally stable, for here  the  underlying  forces  responsible  for
               the CDW instability  are  most  readily  identified  and ultimately can be
              used to predict new classes  of  CDW materials.  ***
