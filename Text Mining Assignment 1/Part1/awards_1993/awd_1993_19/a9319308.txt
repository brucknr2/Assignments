Abstract    :
              9319308  Mijovic    This grant provides partial funding for the purchase of
              equipment  for dielectric measurements.  Three departments will be represented 
              in research which requires the use of this equipment:     Chemical Engineering,
              Chemistry, and Electrical Engineering.  No  similar equipment is available at
              Polytechnic University, which  will be used in a variety of research
              activities.  ***
