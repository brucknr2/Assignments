Abstract    :
              9319119  Lamb       Atmospheric trace gases frequently contact the surfaces of
              ice  in many clouds, as well as the earth's surface in cold climatic  regions. 
              The nature of such heterogenous gas-ice interactions is  still largely unknown,
              so specific experiments have been designed  to gain insight into the
              corresponding molecular-scale mechanisms  and to provide quantitative estimates
              of parameters used in  atmospheric models.  These experiments will acquire both
              kinetic  and thermodynamic data as inorganic gases in the nitrogen, sulfur  and
              chlorine families are allowed to contact ice particles under  controlled
              conditions.  The primary tool for this research will be  a new, virtually
              wall-less, continuous flow reactor with an  atmospheric pressure
              ionization-mass spectrometer interfaced to the  reactor for on-line analysis of
              the gaseous reaction products.  The  chemical systems which will be studied
              include SO2 (sulfur dioxide)  - O3 (ozone) - ice aerosols, HNO3 (nitric acid
              vapor) - ice or H2SO4  interpreted in ways that permit multiphase chemical
              phenomena in  the atmosphere to be quantified and understood in terns of
              nature's  fundamental processes.
