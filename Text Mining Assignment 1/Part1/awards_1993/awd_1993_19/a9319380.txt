Abstract    :
              9319380  Srienc  This project is to study the interaction of ciliate populations
               with their environment.  Flow cytometry is the main tool for  quantifying
              particulate materials, ciliate populations, and  ciliate metabolic responses. 
              The objectives include: (1) the  kinetics of feeding, growth, and reproduction
              of the organism  Tetrahymena pyriformis GL with extensions to concentrated 
              particle suspensions, particles with modified surface  chemistries, and
              suspensions of non-viable fluorescent bacteria;  (2) the quantification of
              growth dynamics of ciliates under  transient nutritional shifts in batch and
              continuous culture; and  (3) modeling of ciliate population dynamics during the
              different  stages of the ciliate cell cycle.  ***
