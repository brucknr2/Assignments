Abstract    :
              9319209  Momoh  The Howard University Center for Energy Systems and Controls 
              (CESaC) within the Department of Electrical Engineering will  conduct a 2nd
              International Workshop on Power Systems Operations  and Planning.  The first
              workshop was held in Lagos during 1992  and focused on voltage regulation.  The
              activities of this  workshop are documented in our proceedings   
              "International Workshop on Voltage Collapse and Voltage       Regulation '92"
              (IWVCVR '92)  The need for increased collaboration and exchange of technical 
              information in planning and operation is timely for both the U.S.  and
              SubSaharan Africa.  Some of the planning and operational  problems include
              development of strategies for handling small and  large disturbance modeling
              problems, and inefficient and  uneconomic operations and reliability issues. 
              The participants  of this workshop will include countries from SubSaharan
              Africa  and the United States.  Power engineers from Ghana, Kenya,  Cameroon,
              Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zaire, Mozambique and Zimbabwe  will be invited to
              participate in tutorials, lectures,  discussions and recommendations.  ***
