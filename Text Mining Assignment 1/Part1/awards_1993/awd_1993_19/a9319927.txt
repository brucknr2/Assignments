Abstract    :
              9319927  Satterlie    Behavioral arousal in animals and humans occurs when there
               is  a  change  in  several  independent behaviors so  that  the  overall 
              behavioral  output  is  more focussed  or  efficient.  Behavioral  arousal is
              an important issue that is not well-understood at  the  cellular level. In the
              marine mollusc Clione when prey is nearby,  a  feeding  arousal response occurs
              in which there is a decreased  threshold  for  starting  the feeding behavior, 
              an  increase  in  swimming  speed for more efficient prey capture, an  increase
               in  heart  rate  and  an inhibition of the withdrawal response.  This  work 
              will  investigate the cellular mechanisms  in  the  nervous  system  that  give
               rise to this change in behavioral  state  and  examine  the  role  of  the 
              brain  chemical  serotonin  in  this  behavior.   Clione  is  an excellent
              animal  in  which  to  study  behavioral arousal because the neural circuits
              that underlie  the  component  behaviors  (feeding, swimming,  and  withdrawal)
               have  already  been worked out and the level of individual nerve  cells  by 
              the  PI  and others. The PI has also shown that injection  of  serotonin into
              the animal results in feeding arousal behavior and  that  there  are cells in
              the Clione nervous system that  contain  serotonin. ***
