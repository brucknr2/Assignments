Abstract    :
              9319404  Maradudin  This proposal concerns several aspects of materials theory; 
              anharmonic interactions in crystals, optical properties of solids  and the
              doping of semiconductor systems.  (1a) First principles  calculations of the
              anharmonic force constants and phonon  linewidths in Al and Cu will be
              performed.  (1b) Calculations of  the ultrasonic attenuation in Si will be
              attempted.  (2a) The  nonreciprocal photonic band structure effects in n-type 
              semiconductors in magnetic fields will be investigated.  (2b) Light 
              localization in infinite periodic arrays of dielectric rods will be  studied. 
              (3a) The stability of ternary alloys of III-V  semiconductors deposited on
              semiconductor substrates will be  examined from the point of view of elastic
              energy effects.  (3b)  The equilibrium doping of boron in silicon will be
              studied taking  special account of vibrational contributions to the free
              energy.  %%%  This proposal concerns the calculation of a wide variety of 
              materials properties in specific systems.  It is divided into three  broad
              areas.  The first concerns vibrational properties of metals  and semiconductors
              - specifically how sound is attenuated in  silicon and how harmonic are the
              vibrations in simple metals.  The  second involves how light may be trapped or
              may be manipulated in  carefully constructed periodic materials.  The third
              studies the  stability of semiconductor alloys that are adsorbed on other 
              semiconductors and why it is difficult to dope silicon with boron  (a useful
              dopant if it could be achieved).  ***
