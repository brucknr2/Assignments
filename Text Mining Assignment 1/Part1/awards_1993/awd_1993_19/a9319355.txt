Abstract    :
                The growth, differentiation and survival of nerve cells, or neurons, depend
              upon signals exchanged between them and the structures they innervate with
              synaptic contacts.  A protein that is believed to be important in synapse
              formation is agrin.  This project exploits a well-known neuromuscular synapse
              in the eye, and a novel technique for molecular analysis of single neurons to
              examine the control of the expression of the genes which produce agrin. 
              Molecular and cellular biological techniques allow examining changes in agrin
              expression during development, and the origins within single cells of the four
              alternatively spliced messenger-RNA sequences involved in the expression. 
              Results will be important to understanding cell-cell interactions that direct
              synapse formation during development, which is fundamental to organization of
              the nervous system.
