Abstract    :
              9319462  Hebert    The response of turbulent mixing in the upper tropical ocean
              to  strong surface forcing, namely westerly wind bursts and rain  squalls, will
              be studied through a hierarchy of numerical  simulations and model comparisons
              to observations.  This study is  a contribution to TOGA COARE (Tropical Ocean
              Global Atmosphere  Coupled Ocean Atmosphere Response Experiment).
