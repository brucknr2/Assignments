Abstract    :
              9319799  Kurz  This award is for support to convene a workshop on the Pliocene 
              history of the East Antarctic ice sheet.  Recent evidence from  glacial
              geologic studies of the Sirius Formation (a deposit of a  variety of glacial
              sediments which is found at high elevations  throughout the Transantarctic
              Mountains) has suggested that the  East Antarctic ice sheet may have been
              significantly smaller during  the Pliocene, thus challenging the prevailing
              view that it has  remained stable over long time periods.  Understanding the
              timing  and causes of variations in the Antarctic ice sheet is critical to 
              global climate and sea level models.  The result of this workshop  will be a
              concise summary of the existing information, a review of  glacial geologic
              models, and identification of the critical data  that must be obtained to
              better constrain the models of the East  Antarctic ice sheet.   ***
