Abstract    :
              9319198  Dawson       Computer simulation of plasma accelerators, light sources 
              and solar/astrophysical phenomena are used to study a broad class  of basic
              plasma processess.  The simulations are performed on  supercomputers,
              workstations and PC's.  Recent studies have  successfully explored the
              application of parallel computers to  plasma physics and have provided a model
              for advanced scientific  computing for the community.  Training of students in
              the use of  the most advanced computing techniques is a significant aspect of 
              the research.  ***
