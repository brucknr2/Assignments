Abstract    :
              9319447  Kaler    In the first two-year research period, electron microscopy,
              light, X-ray and neutron scattering, time resolved fluorescence quenching, and
              NM self-diffusion measurements were used to discover and chartreuse a menagerie
              of novel microstructures in synthetic and biological surfactant systems.  The
              key to enlarging the realm of surfactant solution microstructure (from the
              limits of simple micelles and lamellar phases) has been the "physical
              synthesis" of new materials by mixing surfactants to achieve a desired set of
              properties.  This has been most clearly  the demonstrated in the catanionic
              vesicle systems we discovered and investigated during the first research
              period.  The cationic surfactant cetyl trimethylammonium tosylate (CTAT) and
              the anionic surfactant sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate (SDBS) associate in
              solution to form a quasi-double-tailed surfactant that forms bilayers rather
              than micelles.  The bilayers of the catanionic mixture have different
              properties than do covalently bound zwitterionic double-tailed surfactants; the
              catanionic mixture forms unilamellar vesicles while the covalent zwitterionic
              surfactants form multilamellar phases. It is hypothesized that new
              microstructures are produces in mixtures because the intermolecular and
              interaggregate forces are altered in ways impossible in single component
              surfactant solutions.  In this renewal, experimental and theoretical efforts
              are used to design new microstructures of mixed surfactant systems by
              understanding how the components of the surfactant mixtures alter the
              intermolecular and inter-aggregate forces.  ***
