Abstract    :
                 This research concentrates on algorithms that discover  information about
              graphs.  To discover almost anything  interesting about a  graph it is
              necessary to look at the  whole graph.  On the other hand, there are  important
               sequential algorithms whose running time is proportional to  the size  of the
              input graph.  Two of these algorithms solve the problems (a) of   finding a
              depth-first spanning tree and (b) of finding a breadth-first   spanning tree. 
              This  research seeks to answer two questions:  (1) How quickly and efficiently 
              can the problems that these algorithms solve be solved in  parallel?  (2)  Can
              several instances of these problems, on the same graph,   but with different
              starting vertices, be solved by a much more efficient   technique than just
              solving  each instance separately?    An affirmative answer to the second 
              question will result in a faster algorithm that finds    the diameter of a
              graph, an important problem in network design.
