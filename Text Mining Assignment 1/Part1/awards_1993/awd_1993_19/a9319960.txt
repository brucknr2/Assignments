Abstract    :
              9319960  WHITE  This project seeks to develop a better scientific understanding 
              of the factors that lead people to file for personal bankruptcy.   About
              900,000 individuals and married couples filed for personal  bankruptcy in 1992,
              a three-fold increase since 1984.  There are  about 10 personal bankruptcies
              for each corporate bankruptcy and  lenders lose more in personal bankruptcies
              than in corporate  bankruptcies.  But while corporate bankruptcy has received 
              extensive attention from researchers in several fields, there has  been little
              research by economists on personal bankruptcy.  This  project has several aims:
              to increase understanding of personal  bankruptcy by modeling individuals'
              decisions to file for  bankruptcy, by testing whether credit markets are
              responsive to  specific features of personal bankruptcy law, and by analyzing 
              possible reforms to U.S. personal bankruptcy law.    One part of this project
              involves constructing a theoretical  model of individual households' bankruptcy
              decisions.  It will be  combined with a model of lenders' behavior to produce a
              model of  the credit market that can be used to analyze current U.S. 
              bankruptcy policy from an economic efficiency standpoint.  A  second part of
              the project involves empirically testing whether  borrowers' demand for credit
              and lenders' willingness to lend  vary depending on specific features of
              personal bankruptcy law in  the state where the borrower lives.  Data for the
              studies will  come from the Survey of Consumer Finance, supplemented with 
              information concerning each state's bankruptcy exemptions.  The  theoretical
              model and the empirical study will be combined and  used to analyze possible
              reforms to U.S. personal bankruptcy law.  ***
