Abstract    :
              In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry program of the  
              Chemistry Division Paul Devlin of Oklahoma State University will use  
              vibrational spectroscopy to characterize molecular behavior at the   surface of
              various water ice forms including cubic ice, amorphous ice,   acid hydrates,
              and clathrate hydrates.  One focus of the proposed work is   on the behavior of
              "dangling" hydrogen bonds at the surfaces as well as   of various types of
              adsorbed small molecules.  Adsorbates of interest   include H2, CO2, SO3, HCl,
              ethyne, benzene, and CO and N2.  The nature of   structural defects in ice and
              their importance in the properties and   phase transitions of ice and
              clathrates will also be investigated.    Devlin will collaborate with a
              theoretician who will simulate his   experimental data in order to learn more
              about the adsorption process.    This project entails in part a fundamental
              laboratory study of processes   which take place on ice surfaces, many of which
              are involved in natural   phenomena of considerable current interest.  Among
              these are the   environmentally urgent issues of the formation of the ozone
              hole, acid   rain, and smog.  In addition, these experiments will help
              elucidate such   areas of astrophysical interest as the mechanism of the
              formation of   molecules in interstellar space and the composition of cometary
              tails.
