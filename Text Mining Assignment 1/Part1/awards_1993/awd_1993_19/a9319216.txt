Abstract    :
              9319216  Abolins       This grant supports a program of research in elementary- 
              particle physics with an international collaboration that studies  properties
              of proton-antiproton interactions produced in the  Fermilab Tevatron
              colliding-beams accelerator complex.  Topics of  interest include a continuing
              search for the elusive top quark,  precision measurement of parameters
              important for detailed  investigation of the validity of the "standard model"
              theoretical  framework.  Included is support for further instrumentation 
              development to improve the capability of the detection apparatus.  ***
