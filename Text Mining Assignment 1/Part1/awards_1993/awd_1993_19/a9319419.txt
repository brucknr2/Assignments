Abstract    :
              9319419  Bentrude  New free radical and photochemical reactions of tri- and  
              penta-coordinate phosphorous molecules will be studied with   attention
              directed to reaction mechanisms and synthetic   applications. The reactions
              will include the use of   organophosphorous molecules as free radical trapping
              agents   and the chemistry of cation radicals produced from tri-  coordinate
              phosphorous derivatives by single-electron   transfer. Photochemical studies
              will include   photorearrangements of allyl phosphite triesters and photo- 
              Abruzov rearrangements of benzyl phosphites. Questions of   1,3-biradical
              intermediates in the allylic rearrangement and   of singlet or triplet excited
              states in the photo-Abruzov   rearrangement will be explored.  %%%  This grant
              from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the   continuing work of Professor
              Wesley G. Bentrude at the   University of Utah. New reactions of molecules
              containing   phosphorous atoms with three and four other atoms or groups  
              attached will be studied. The groups will contain carbon,   hydrogen, oxygen,
              and other atoms. The reactions will   include trapping of carbon free radicals
              (e.g., carbon   bonding to three other atoms and possessing one non-bonded  
              electron) and ultraviolet-light induced reactions. Attention   will be given to
              the detailed steps in these reactions and   synthetic applications. This work
              provides potential impact   in areas such as antitumor and antiviral agents,
              fuel   additives, pesticides, and key biochemical intermediates.  ***
