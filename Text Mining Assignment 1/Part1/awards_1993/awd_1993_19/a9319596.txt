Abstract    :
                                        ABSTRACT                                  AST-9319596 
              Appleton & Struck-Marcell    This project will concentrate on a rare but
              important class  of colliding and merging galaxies, namely the colliding 
              "ring" galaxies.  The rings are thought to form from a head-  on collision
              between two galaxies, one of which passed down  the spin-axis of the other. 
              These galaxies are ideal  laboratories for exploring the effects of
              density-waves on  the star formation properties of the host disk galaxy as 
              well as providing information about the form of the  potential in which the gas
              disk resides  ***.
