Abstract    :
                    9319977  Hamilton    Peculiar velocities distort the pattern of clustering
              of galaxies  observed in redshift space.  Analysis of these distortions offers 
              an exciting and powerful tool for understanding the large scale  distribution
              of matter and its velocity in the Universe.  Dr.  Hamilton has recently been
              developing new methods of measuring  these subtle distortions, and with this
              award he will continue this  work and pursue its various ramifications.  He has
              introduced the  idea of measuring redshift distortions from the harmonics of
              the  correlation function, and has suggested improved techniques to  allow
              these harmonics and their uncertainties to be measured  reliably from
              observations.  The study of redshift distortions on  large scales should become
              an increasingly important tool as  redshift surveys increase in depth and
              reliability.
