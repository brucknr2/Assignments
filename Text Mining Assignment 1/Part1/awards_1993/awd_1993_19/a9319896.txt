Abstract    :
              9319896  Bauer    The effects of temperature, internal strain, current density,
              and  applied stress on the stability of fine microstructures in thin  films are
              investigated using a combination of theoretical,  computational, and
              experimental methods.  The theoretical and  computational methods involve
              evaluation of transport processes  induced by capillarity, mechanical stress,
              and/or electric field in  polycrystalline thin films.  The experimental methods
              involve  application of continuous, alternating, or pulsed electric and/or 
              mechanical fields to mono, bi, tri, or polycrystalline thin films  of either
              aluminum or gold, and dilute alloys thereof, measurement  of electrical
              resistance, and characterization of corresponding  microstructure by optical,
              scanning electron, transmission  electron, scanning force, and scanning auger
              microscopy.  These  methods are combined to investigate the degradation and
              eventual  breakup of polycrystalline thin films by capillarity, mechanical 
              stress, electric field, and combinations thereof.    %%%  This study is
              expected to clarify the origin and behavior of many  microstructural features
              associated with degradation and eventual  failure of thin films.  Improved
              fundamental understanding of the  stability of fine microstructures in thin
              films is essential for  effective production of sub-micrometer devices required
              for  advanced technological applications.  ***
