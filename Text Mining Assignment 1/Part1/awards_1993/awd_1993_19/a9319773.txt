Abstract    :
              9319773  Granato     Ultrasonic measurements are applied to two different
              topics.  In  the first case the effect of viscosity on dislocation tunneling 
              through impurity pinning points is determined by comparing the  ultrasonically
              found microyield stress in the normal and  superconducting state in dilute
              aluminum alloys.  The measurements  build on results from a previous grant that
              showed dislocation  tunneling occurring below , but not above, 0.5 degrees
              Kelvin. The  second case involves a critical test of the interstitialcy model
              of  condensed matter states by measuring the temperature dependence of  the
              elastic constants of aluminum and other crystals just below the  melting
              temperature by an electromagnetic acoustic transformation  technique (EMAT). 
              Positive results for an unusual and unexpected  effect would confirm a simple,
              quantitative easily visualized model  according to which liquids and amorphous
              materials are crystals  containing a few percent of self-interstitials.  %%% 
              Knowledge obtained from this research is important to the  understanding of
              material properties in superconductors, amorphous  materials and glasses.  ***
