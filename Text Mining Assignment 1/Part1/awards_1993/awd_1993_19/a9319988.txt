Abstract    :
              9319988  Peckham  This proposal from Case Western Reserve University requests 
              partial support to conduct a symposium entitled Neural  Prostheses: Motor
              Systems IV Conference.    The symposium focuses on integration of engineering
              and  clinical expertise in developing devices that restore  function for
              individuals with motor impairments; to expedite  the transference of neural
              prostheses from the engineering  laboratory to the clinic and manufacturing
              industry; and to  educate young researchers.  The international scientific 
              meeting is the fourth in a series of conferences held every  three years. 
              Sessions to be held include neural prostheses  for lower extremity, upper
              extremity, bladder, and  respiratory; electrodes, leads, and connectors; muscle
              and  muscle properties; feedback control strategies; command  control; and
              technology transfer.    Presenter participants in the symposium are world
              leaders in  neural prostheses for motor control.  Funding requested from  the
              NSF would provide partial support for invited  participants.  Four papers will
              be submitted for peer  reviewed journal publication by symposium participants, 
              thereby making symposium results available to a large  audience.  ***
