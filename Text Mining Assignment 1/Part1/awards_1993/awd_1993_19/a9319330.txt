Abstract    :
              9319330  Bradshaw  Support is provided for two international workshops that will
               develop work plans for defining the causes and effects of global  scale
              environmental change.  The workshops are to he held under the  auspices of the
              Inter-American Institute for Global Change (IAI).   IAI scientists have
              determined that studying temperate terrestrial  ecosystems is a high priority
              because of their ecological,  economic, and sociological importance. 
              Environmental research is  needed to define similarities and differences
              between North and  South America temperate terrestrial ecosystems with regard
              to  global change patterns and processes.  An existing IAI working  group known
              as America's Interhemisphere Geo-biosphere Organization  (AMIGO) will conduct
              an initial workshop to develop a work plan for  studying these ecosystems, and
              a second workshop will focus on  implementation of the workplan.  This project
              is being run in  cooperation with NOAA's Global Change Research Program.   ***
