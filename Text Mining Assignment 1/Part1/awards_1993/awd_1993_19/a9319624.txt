Abstract    :
              Adenosine is a naturally-occurring substance which serves as  a
              neurotransmitter, thereby helping cells to communicate.  Target cells which are
              responsive to adenosine bear specific  receptors for adenosine.  These
              receptors transmit the  adenosine signal from outside of the cell to the
              interior,  and the function of the target cell can be regulated.  The 
              preliminary data for this project demonstrates that the  adenosine receptor
              subtype 2a  A2a receptor  is subject to  regulation by adenosine itself and
              potentially by other  neurotransmitters.  The adenosine receptor protein has 
              structural features which are potential targets for  regulatory mechanisms,
              such as the addition of phosphate  groups.  The proposed work will use
              molecular biology and  pharmacology methods in a laboratory cell culture system
              to  analyze the structural features of the A2a adenosine  receptor which confer
              regulation of the receptor protein.
