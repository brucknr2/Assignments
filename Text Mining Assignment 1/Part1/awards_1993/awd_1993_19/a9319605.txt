Abstract    :
              9319605  Fehn           This project is a continuation of the Principal
              Investigator's  work on the determination of cosmogenic isotopes in fluids from
              the  KTB deep drill hole in Germany.  Initial results suggest that 36  Cl/Cl
              ratios in waters collected from the pilot hole and from the  main borehole
              reflect the subsurface production of these isotopes.   The results can
              therefore be used for the determination of  residence times and source
              formations of these waters.         The Principal Investigator has made good
              progress with modest  initial funding to demonstrate the feasibility of using
              the  chlorine isotope systematics to determine the residence times and  sources
              of deep fluids found in the KTB boreholes.  The results of  this project should
              lead to a much better understanding of fluid  flow, origin, and residence time
              of deep crustal fluids.  ***
