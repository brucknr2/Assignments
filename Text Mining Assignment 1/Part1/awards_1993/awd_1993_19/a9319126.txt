Abstract    :
                                      Abstract         The UAB-Georgia Tech International
              Conference on Differential    Equations and Mathematical Physics is devoted to
              topics in the general    area of linear and nonlinear partial differential
              equations and their    relation to  mathematical physics. This will include
              topics such as the    analysis of multiparticle Schroedinger operators,
              stability of matter,    relativity theory, quantum field theory, spectral and
              scattering theory    including spectral geometry, inverse problems, Korteweg-de
              Vries    equations, as well as related topics.         This conference series
              has been very successful in bringing together    scholars from around the world
              for fruitful scientific exchange in an    active area in which modern
              mathematical analysis comes to grips with    problems of scientific importance.
              Typically, the conference will    attract participants from over twenty
              different countries. Since 1992,    it is now a joint project between The
              University of Alabama at Birmingham    and The Georgia Institute of Technology.
              The next conference in this    series will take place at The University of
              Alabama at Birmingham, 13-17    March 1994. On March 11-12, the University of
              Alabama, Tuscaloosa, will    hold a workshop supported by NSF EPSCoR in Alabama
              on ordinary differential    equations, which was planned for participants who
              will arrive early before    the beginning of the UAB-Georgia Tech International
              Conference. On March    18-19, a regional meeting of the American Mathematical
              Society will take    place at the University of Kentucky with special sessions
              in differential    equations and mathematical quantum theory. Many people have
              planned to    participate in two or three of these conferences.
