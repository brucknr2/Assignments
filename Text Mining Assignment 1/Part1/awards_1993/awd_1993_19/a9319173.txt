Abstract    :
              This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program supports
              the work of  Dr. Clifford Kubiak of the Chemistry Department, Purdue
              University, on reduction of carbon  dioxide.  Organometallic cluster compounds
              containing three nickel atoms and bridging  bis(diphenylphosphino)methane
              bridging groups have been found to act as photocatalysts for the  addition of
              carbon dioxide to alkenes, and as electrocatalysts for the reduction of carbon
              dioxide  to oxalate.  These, as well as newly synthesized, photocatalytic and
              electrocatalytic systems will  be investigated using low temperature
              photochemistry in matrices, kinetics by laser transient  absorption methods,
              infrared spectroelectrochemistry, and rapid scan voltammetry.  Another goal  of
              the project is to elucidate the role of electronic coupling between
              interconnected metal  clusters, and new cluster assemblies in which ligand bond
              length and electronic properties are  systematically varied will be prepared.  
               This research is focused on reactions of carbon dioxide with transition metal
              complexes.   Chemical, photochemical, and electrochemical means will be
              employed to promote the reduction  of carbon dioxide, including reactions in
              which carbon from this source is bonded to other  carbon atoms to form longer
              carbon chains.  These studies are relevant to the problem of finding  good uses
              for carbon dioxide that might be obtained from an atmospheric oversupply.
