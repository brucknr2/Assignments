Abstract    :
                         IRI-9319969  Myers    This is the first year of a three year
              continuing award to  investigate architectures for script-based and
              object-based  demonstrational programming interfaces and their use in 
              visualization.  The overall concept of demonstrational interfaces  is to allow
              the user to operate on example values from which the  system generalizes.  The
              approach of script-based interfaces, as  contrasted with object-based
              approaches, lends itself to  generalization when a specifically given script
              trace is extended  to other cases.  The object-based approach is investigated
              as it  relates to data visualization by generalizing the properties of the 
              data and the typical graphics used in the domain.  The ultimate  goal is to
              make the design of a custom interface as simple as  sketching a picture on a
              napkin.
