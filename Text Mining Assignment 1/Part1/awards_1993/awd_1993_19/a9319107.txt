Abstract    :
              9319107  DeLyser     The equipment purchased through this grant will be
              dedicated to support research in the Departments of Engineering and Chemistry
              in computer and information science and engineering.  The equipment will be
              used for several research projects, including: (1) Investigation of slotline to
              microstrip and coaxial transitions and passive devices that incorporate those
              transitions, (2) Microwave field calculations to support electron paramagnetic
              resonance instrumentation development and measurements, (3) Speech enhancement
              and noisy speech processing, (4) Gas turbine heat transfer and particle
              deposition in gas turbine engines, and (5) Robust Wigner-Ville signal analysis.
               The equipment consists of two IBM RS6000 model 370 Powerstations, each with a
              two Gigabyte internal fixed disk, 128 Megabytes of RAM, and a 19-inch color
              display monitor.  They will be networked with three existing X-Terminals, an
              8mm tape drive, and a Hewlett Packard LaserJet Printer.  The software, in
              addition to the pre-loaded IBM software consists of the Hewlett Packard High
              Frequency Design System and Microwave Design System, Entropic Signal Processing
              Software xwaves+, Fluid Dynamics International Fluid Dynamics Analysis Package,
              and MATLAB from the MathWorks, Inc.  The Department of Engineering has no
              computational facilities dedicated to research.  Furthermore, the department's
              workstations lack the fixed disk space and RAM required by the researchers.
