Abstract    :
              9319280  Keating    This  is  a  study to find out about how the brain  controls
               the  movement of our eyes during voluntary visually guided tracking of  a 
              moving  target. The experiments in this study are designed  to  determine  what
              role a part of the forebrain called  the  frontal  eye  field  pursuit  area
              plays in the control  of  these  smooth  pursuit movements of the eyes. To do
              this, parts of the forebrain  will  be  inactivated  by either cooling or 
              anesthesia  and  the  effects  on  visually  guided tracking  movements 
              measured.  The  changes  in the eye movements that result from inactivation 
              will  be compared to some of the different scientific models of how eye 
              movements   are  controlled.  The  work  will  make   significant 
              contributions to our understanding of the frontal eye  fields  in  the control
              of voluntary eye movements.
