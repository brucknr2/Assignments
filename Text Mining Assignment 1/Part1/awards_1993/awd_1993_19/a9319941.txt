Abstract    :
              9319941  Harris  This award supports the Chlamydomonas Genetics Center at Duke 
              University. The Chlamydomonas Genetics Center serves as a central  repository
              to receive, catalogue, preserve and distribute wild  type and mutant cultures
              of the green alga Chlamydomonas  reinhardtii and other chlamydomonas species in
              which extensive  genetic analysis has been done.  The Center also maintains and
               distributes gnomic and cDNA clones of Chlamydomonas nuclear,  chloroplast and
              mitochondrial genes.  Information on culture  methods, genetic analysis, and
              other aspects of Chlamydomonas  research is also provided, and an extensive
              bibliography of  references on Chlamydomonas, and a DNA sequence database are 
              available.  Descriptions of strains and plasmids in the  Chlamydomonas Genetics
              Center are directly accessible to the  public on the Duke University gopher
              server, and will in the  future be part of a comprehensive public database now
              being  created.
