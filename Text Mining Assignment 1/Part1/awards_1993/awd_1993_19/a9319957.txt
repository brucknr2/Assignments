Abstract    :
               Algorithms for symbolic and numeric manipulation of   systems are needed for
              basic symbolic, numeric and geometric    computations and  their application to
              problems in graphics,  geometric   modeling, robotics, vision  and engineering.
               This  research takes a three-fold approach   to these problems  using 
              multipolynomial resultants:  (1) Develop better   algorithms for  symbolic 
              resultant computation and solving nonlinear polynomial    equations using 
              resultants and matrix computations.  Algorithms  are being   developed in the 
              context of exact arithmetic as well as  floating point   arithmetic.  It
              involves  better formulations of  resultants in terms of matrices and  
              determinants and use  of  symbolic and numeric algorithms making use of the
              matrix    formulation.  (2)  Specialize these algorithms to applications in 
              computer   graphics, geometric  modeling and robotics by making use  of the
              specific   polynomial systems arising  in these applications.  (3)  Develop a
              library of routines,   ELIMPACK, for  symbolic  resultant computation and
              finding roots of   polynomial equations  (in  exact and floating point
              arithmetic).  This package is of   great utility to  symbolic computation,
              numerical computation,  geometric   applications and the  engineering
              community.  The  results also help in   understanding the  complexity of 
              geometric problems described in terms of   polynomial equations.
