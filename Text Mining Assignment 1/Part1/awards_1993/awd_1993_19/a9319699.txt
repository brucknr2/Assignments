Abstract    :
              9319699  Kapp    This is a proposal to continue the PI's studies of the 
              circuits in the brain that give rise to learned arousal, a  behavioral state
              characterized by vigilance or enhanced  readiness to process sensory 
              information from  one's  environment.  The proposed research tests the
              hypothesis  that the central nucleus of the amygdala, a structure-long 
              implicated in emotional arousal, contributes to a learned  increase in arousal
              by exerting a modulatory influence on  the activity of two groups of brain
              cells which enhance the  impact of sensory events on the animal.  The analysis
              of  anatomical substrates for conditioned arousal is interesting  and
              important.  The results will provide important  information concerning brain
              circuits that provide the  optimal conditions for detecting and processing
              sensory  information.
