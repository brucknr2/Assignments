Abstract    :
              9319211  Poon  This proposal requests for a research program on the study of the
              basic and applied aspects of scanning holography and 3-D image coding.  The
              projects is a continuation of the principal investigator's previous work along
              the line of real-time holographic recording technique using optical heterodyne
              scanning.  Briefly, in the technique, two optical beams of different temporal
              frequencies are use to scan an object to extract the holographic information
              for the object.    In the present proposed research we investigate and compare
              the coherent, partial coherent and incoherent nature of the scanning
              holographic information reduction techniques, 3-D coding and multiple-exposure
              holography are explored and extended to multiple holographic information of the
              object simultaneously.  Advantages of multiple-beam scanning includes real-time
              operation and large multiplexing capability. The integration of an
              electron-beam-addressed spatial light modulator for coherent reconstruction
              with the scanning holographic recording system also is investigated in the
              context of real time holography in video rate.  The results of the proposed
              work could lead to better 3-D information processing and coding such as in the
              areas of real-time 3-D  image processing, microscopy, data storage and
              acquisition and optical remote sensing.
