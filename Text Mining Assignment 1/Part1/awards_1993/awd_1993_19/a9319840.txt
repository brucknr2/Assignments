Abstract    :
              9319840  Szeto  This award will help fund a workshop that will be held in 
              conjunction with the 15th Annual International Conference of  the IEEE
              Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society  meeting.  The workshop is entitled
              "Non-Stationary Signal  Analysis and Applications in Biomedical Signal
              Processing"  and it will be held in San Diego, California on October 27-  31,
              1993.  The award will provide support for the three  workshop instructors,
              allow the registration fee for the  participants to be reduced from the normal
              amount, and  provide funding for some administration.  The workshop is 
              important since it will focus on advanced signal processing  techniques that
              could be used in the study of biomedical  systems.  ***
