Abstract    :
                  9319712  Dean  This award provides continued support for the operation of
              the Bacillus  Genetic Stock Center (BGSC) located at Ohio State University. The
              BGSC  houses a public collection devoted to Bacillus, maintains 1300 highly 
              characterized strains and a warehouse of 2500 other interesting strains. The 
              BGSC serves the researchers in academic as well as industrial institutions all 
              over the world.  During the past five years, BGSC has continued to update its 
              collection to meet the changing needs of the research community, distributed 
              8200 cultures to users, published the strain catalog and newsletters, and has 
              published the revised B. subtilis genetic map.  Under this new grant, the  BGSC
              will continue distributing its resources.  In addition, it plans to: (1) 
              publish new editions of the strain catalog in both hard copy and computerized 
              formats; (2) continue publication of the newsletter; (3) add a DNA collection 
              and gene and mutant libraries; (4) confirm phenotypes for every item in the 
              collection; and (5) expand the BGSC Data Center to include bibliographic, 
              genetic map, and methods databases.  The genus Bacillus includes B. subtilis, 
              a species more thoroughly characterized than any other bacterium outside the 
              enterics, and organisms utilized to produce biopesticides, food additives, 
              antibiotics, and enzymes.  The usefulness of BGSC is expected to increase as 
              research on and application of Bacillus is increasing world-wide.    ***
