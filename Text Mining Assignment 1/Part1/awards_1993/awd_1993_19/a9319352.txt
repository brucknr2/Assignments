Abstract    :
              9319352  Michel  We propose to investigate the applicability of robust control 
              theoretic results in the qualitative analysis of power systems.   Thus far,
              only a few isolated applications of robust control  theoretic results to power
              systems have appeared in the literature.    The proposed work consists of two
              principal areas of inquiry:   (a) modeling of power systems, and (b) robust
              stability properties  of an equilibrium of a power system.    We will develop
              models for contemporary power systems which include  some of the latest devices
              and some of the most current  technologies (e.g., flexible 'AC transmission
              systems (FACTS),  static VAR compensators (SVC), and so forth).  This research
              will  build on previous NSF supported work by the principal  investigators.   
              The second part of the proposed work consists of two segments.  In  the first
              segment we intend to conduct robust stability analysis  investigations of
              linear models of power systems in the state  space.  Among other areas, results
              of this kind are important in  synthesis procedures (such as stabilizer
              design).  Our approach  will rely on Hurwitz stability investigations of
              interval matrices  which arise in the modeling of power systems subjected to
              parameter  perturbations.  In the second segment we extend that above proposed 
              work to nonlinear models of power systems in a state space setting.  The work
              proposed above (in both segments) will rely on stability  results developed by
              the principal investigators and their co-  workers with prior NSF support.  ***
