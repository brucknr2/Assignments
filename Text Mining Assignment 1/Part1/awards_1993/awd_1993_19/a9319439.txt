Abstract    :
              9319439  Hook    Cell-cell communication in neuroendocrine systems utilizes
              small,  potent, peptide hormones and neurotransmitters that are secreted  from
              nerve cells.  These peptide hormones and peptide  neurotransmitters are
              synthesized as large protein precursors or  prohormones that require specific
              proteolytic processing to yield  the smaller physiologically active peptides. 
              The prohormone  processing enzymes represent an important point of regulation
              since  it is this step where the inactive prohormone is converted to the 
              smaller active forms.  Active processing enzymes are prerequisite  for the
              formation of potent functionally relevant neuropeptides.   Dr. Hook i examining
              the role of a 70 kDa aspartyl protease in  manufacturing enkephalin and
              neuropeptide Y peptides from its  larger precursor products.  These two
              peptides serve very important  functions.  Enkephalin is an endogenous opiate
              that plays a  critical role in controlling pain and Neuropeptide Y is shown to
              be  involved in feeding, shifting of biological rhythms, hypotension  and
              reproduction.  Dr. Hook will use state-of- the-art technologies  to purify and
              characterize this enzyme.  She will then generate  large quantities of the
              prohormone to establish that the newly  purified protease produces enkephalin
              and neuropeptide Y.  Finally,  Dr. Hook will use a technique called directed
              mutagenesis to  determine the specific sites of action of the 70 kDa aspartyl 
              protease.  The results from this work is fundamental for  understanding  the
              molecular basis of precursor processing in  generating active neuropeptides as
              well as contributing to a more  general understanding about the control of
              biologically important  messengers.  The greatest promise of this basic
              research on how  peptides are normally regulated may be in ultimate treatment
              of  drug addiction since it appears that the regulation of the levels  and
              activities of enkephalin may be involved.  ***
