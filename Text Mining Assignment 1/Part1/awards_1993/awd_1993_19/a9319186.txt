Abstract    :
              9319186  Sides    This is an investigation of the kinetics of organometallic
              vapor-  phase epitaxy (OMVPE) of homoepitaxial cadmium telluride at both  the
              macroscopic and microscopic levels.  Macroscopic experiments  explore the
              effect of misorientation of substrates on the  morphology of OMVPE-deposited
              material.  Rate laws for step growth  and for hillock growth are developed in
              order to test the  hypothesis that steps are critical sites of reactions of the
               commonly used sources dimethlycadmium and diisopropyltellurium.    A
              methodology will be developed to use rate laws to predict  conditions under
              which high-quality epitaxial films can be grown.   The effect of substrate
              surface microstructure on the elementary  reactions in the deposition mechanism
              is also investigated.   Scanning tunneling microscopy, low-energy electron
              diffraction, and  other surface science techniques are employed.    Thin films
              of cadmium telluride and related compounds are  attractive for fabrication of
              devices involving light emitters,  radiation detectors, and optical switching. 
              At present, they are  prepared by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), a method that
              is slow,  cumbersome, and expensive.  Perfection of OMVPE techniques should 
              permit higher-volume, lower-cost production of these films, making  them
              acceptable for consumer applications.  It is to this end that  this effort is
              ultimately directed.  ***
