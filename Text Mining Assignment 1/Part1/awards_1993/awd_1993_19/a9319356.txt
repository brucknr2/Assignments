Abstract    :
              93119356  Egeth    This project is designed to examine the temporal and spatial
              aspects of attentional selectivity.  In the spatial domain, the research is
              designed to clarify how preattentive and focal attentive processes cooperate in
              the performance of tasks.  In the temporal domain, the focus is on early
              facilitation and later inhibition following an uninformative cue, with a goal
              of clarifying when processing is retinocentric, environmentally based, object
              based, or object centered.    The first set of proposed experiments is designed
              to determine the efficiency with which subjects can avoid distracting material
              as they search through complicated displays looking for relevant information. 
              Existing work has led to conflicting theoretical explanations of performance in
              such tasks; and the proposed research should help decide among these competing
              alternatives.  A second set of experiments explores the aftermath of a cue
              (e.g., the brief brightening of a dim light) that directs attention to a
              specific location.  Such a cue improves the ability to detect targets presented
              at the cued location.  However, what is surprising is that such improvement is
              short-lived (about 1/2 sec), and is followed by a longer lasting performance
              decrement.  The proposed experiments are an effort to explain the factors that
              cause this performance decrement.  In addition to their theoretical
              significance, both sets of experiments have significance in the world outside
              the laboratory.  Such work is pertinent to many settings in the work place and
              may lead to the discovery of methods to reduce the sometimes catastrophic
              consequences of a failure to pay attention.    ****
