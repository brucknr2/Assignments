Abstract    :
                  The nervous system must develop more intricate functional  connections
              between its cells that any of the other systems of the  body.  To understand
              mechanisms providing such specificity, model  subsystems of the brain often are
              used.  The fruit fly, Drosophila,  has large compound eyes that provide an
              excellent model for  development because classical and molecular genetic
              analysis can be  used, and certain cell types are easy to identify.  Within
              this  compound eyes are repeating subunits containing eight photoreceptor 
              cells, labelled R1 to R8.  The first one to appear differentiated  during
              normal development is R8, and it is thought to play a  critical role in the
              subsequent specification of the remaining 7  photoreceptor cells.  A mutant has
              been found that produces a  retina aberrant in pattern, so named "rap" gene,
              including cloning  and sequencing.  Results will clarify how inductive
              interactions  can regulate cellular specificity, and will have impact on 
              developmental biology as well as neuroscience and visual science.
