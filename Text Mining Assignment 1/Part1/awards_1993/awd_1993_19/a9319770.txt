Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9319770  James Edgar    Localized, confined-area epitaxy is
              developed to reduce the defect density of silicon-carbide (SiC) films on
              silicon (Si) substrates.  The hypothesis is to eliminate defect propagation
              through the necking process, in which defects terminate on the side planes of
              the SiC; epitaxial silicon carbide deposited after the necking process should
              contain fewer defects.  Both selective silicon carbide growth on silica-masked
              silicon and anisotropic growth on nonplanar patterned silicon are examined as
              methods of confining epitaxy to small areas.  New source chemistries using
              chlorinated hydrocarbons and silanes with helium as a carrier  gas are explored
              in attempts to selective epitaxial growth at reduced temperatures and to
              increase growth anisotropy on various crystal planes.  The shape  and
              orientation of the window  pattern, the chlorine content of the source
              materials, the    operating pressure, and temperature are varied to minimize
              the propagation of  defects.    Silicon carbide is an attractive semiconductor
              for many electronic and optoelectronic applications, including high-speed,
              high-power devices, devices that must operate at elevated temperatures,
              microelectromechanical sensors, and solar-blind ultraviolet detectors. 
              However, such applications are hampered by the difficulty of obtaining
              low-defect silicon-carbide films on other semiconductors.  It is this issue
              that is addressed in this research.
