Abstract    :
              9319051  de la Mora    It is proposed to investigate the physics of the
              formation of  ultrafine aerosol particles from electrosprays, and ion emission 
              from droplets.  The experimental and theoretical study on particle  formation
              is well documented, and has relevance in an area of focus  of the Fluid,
              Particulate and Hydraulic Systems programs related to  advanced materials
              research.  The second part on ion emission seems  difficult to be performed as
              described.  The P.I. has a good track  record in his previous grant.    Four
              referees have rated this proposal with 3 Very Good and 1 Good.   The P.I. is a
              creative researcher, who has the expertise as well as  most of the experimental
              facilities to conduct the research.  The  first topic of the project, on the
              generation of monodispered  submicron and nanometer particles, is highly
              recommended for  funding.  Several comments were made on improving the
              experimental  approach (control of the residence time of the fluid in the
              Taylor  cone during measurements) and a suggestion was made on using  numerical
              simulations for data interpretation.  It is expected that  the P.I. will
              address a range of fundamental issues, with a  reasonable chance of success. 
              The second topic of the project has  a lower chance of generating new,
              significant results as compared  on the first topic, and has lowered the
              overall rating of this  proposal.  That area should be de-emphasized in the
              project.  By  considering the goal and quality of this proposal relevant to 
              ultrafine particle synthesis and the unique theoretical-  experimental
              background of the P.I., a standard three-year award of  $225,000 with starting 
              date on March 1, 1994, is recommended, with  the following suggestions:        
              (i)  The main focus of the project will be on ultrafine                 
              particle production       (ii) Numerical modeling of droplet formation should
              be            investigated in order to better understand the mechanisms        
                  and to generalized the results.  ***
