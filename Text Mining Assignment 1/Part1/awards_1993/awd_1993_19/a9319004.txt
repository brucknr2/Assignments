Abstract    :
                        9319004  Roddier    Adaptive optics (AO) is a technique to compensate
              in real-time  image degradation produced by the turbulent atmosphere.  Funds
              are  provided for development of a science-grade instrument that can be 
              mounted at the Cassegrain focus of different telescopes on Mauna  Kea.  The
              system is expected to routinely produce stellar images  with a full width at
              half maximum of the order of 0.1 arc-second,  from 0.8 to 2.2 um.  Although the
              instrument will still require  trained operators, service observation will be
              offered to all IfA  astronomers.  To achieve good performance, the system will
              require  the use of a 16th magnitude guide star or brighter within 20 arc- 
              second of the object to be observed.  The system is to be used  primarily for
              the study of stellar environments.  In this case a  relatively bright central
              star will be used as a guide star,  ensuring optimum system performance.  The
              main scientific goal will  be the detection, mapping, photometry, and
              polarimetry of the light  scattered by dust in the very close circumstellar
              environment.  The   sensitivity of the system should be high enough to detect
              proto-  planetary disks in already advanced stages of condensation and even 
              detect a Jupiter-like planet around a nearby star.
