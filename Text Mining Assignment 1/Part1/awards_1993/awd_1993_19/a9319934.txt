Abstract    :
              9319934  Saladin       Several experimental investigations on the behavior of 
              nuclei at high angular velocity (i.e. high spin) are proposed.   The interest
              in such studies lies in the fact that, as the  angular velocity of a nucleus is
              increased, its internal  structure changes due to the influence of the coriolis
              and  centrifugal interaction.  The proposed experimental program will  be
              carried out with the Pitt array at Notre Dame, the Pitt-FSU  array at FSU and
              at Gammasphere.  In the A=70 to 80 region a  search for theoretically predicted
              superdeformed bands is  proposed.  It is furthermore proposed to study odd A
              nuclei in  the A=70 to 90 region and in particular the odd-odd nucleus Br-  78.
               A series of lifetime studies on Ac-219 by means of DSAM and  the plunger
              method are proposed.  A series of experiments are  proposed. which are based on
              conversion electron spectroscopy  which can provide crucial information on the
              multipolarity of  transitions.  Specifically it is proposed to study the origin
              of  "surplus" electrons that were observed by the Pitt group in Ce-  130. 
              Experiments are planned in neighboring nuclei in the A=130  nuclei and for
              different target and projectile combinations.  It  is furthermore proposed to
              confirm the M1-character of the  recently found so-called M1-bands in the light
              Hg and Pb region.
