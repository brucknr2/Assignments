Abstract    :
              9319708  Schmidt  Lake Vanda is an ice-covered, permanently stratified lake. 
              The    water column, 69-meter deep, presents a wide range of geochemical  and
              microbiological environments.  The lake's 1200-year  stratification history and
              its water column stability make it a  model system for exploring the
              relationship between chemical  processes and microbial diversity and activity. 
              Of special  interest is the relationship between successive reductive and 
              oxidative zones and the microbial and chemical characteristics of  those zones.
               Dr. Green and colleague plan the first simultaneous  study of chemical and
              microbial community structure using a  combination of measurements, including
              determinations of  microbial biomass and diversity as estimated by microscopy
              and  nucleic acid extraction and identification.  Central to this work  is the
              role played by manganese-reducing organisms in metal  cycling in the Vanda
              water column.  The capacity for microbially  mediated manganese cycling will be
              assessed by determining the  abundance of manganese reducers and the mechanisms
              involved in Mn  reduction. In addition, a detailed study of metal transport 
              mechanisms is planned along the 27-km course of the Onyx River,  the lake's
              sole inflow. Determination of metal loadings and  residences times in the lake
              will be made.   ***
