Abstract    :
              9319366  Bentley  This project is to evaluate environmental conditions and
              specific  mechanisms which influence the in vivo stability of recombinant 
              proteins in E. coli.  Attempts are to be made to characterize, at  the
              molecular level, changes occurring within the cell due to  perturbations
              imposed by the overexpression of cloned-proteins.   New techniques to increase
              product yield and reactor productivity  by minimizing product degradation are
              to be developed.  These  include the construction of new expression vectors
              employing  antisense RNA, the genetic modification of host cell metabolism, 
              the development of advanced model-based feeding policies for  bioreactor
              operation, and the development of a new assay for  monitoring proteolytic
              activity.  ***
