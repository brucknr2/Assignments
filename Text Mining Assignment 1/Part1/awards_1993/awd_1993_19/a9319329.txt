Abstract    :
              9319329  Cook         This award is made under the program for Small Grants for 
              Exploratory Reserch (SGER).  The southern Himalayan Mountains in  Nepal are
              strongly affected by the Asian monsoon.  Yet, virtually  no dendroclimatic
              research as been conducted there for the purpose  of reconstructing past
              monsoonal activity, even though there are  numerous native tree species there
              that ar likely to produce  climatically-sensitive tree-ring chronologies.  This
              project is  designed to critically evaluate the regional dendroclimatic 
              potential and establish tree-ring sites in two diverse regions  affected
              differentially by the monsoon.
