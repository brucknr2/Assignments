Abstract    :
              9319788  Dine    This award provides funds to permit Dr. Michael Dine,
              Department  of Physics, University of California, Santa Cruz, to pursue with 
              Dr. Soo-Jong Rey, Department of Physics, Seoul National  University, Korea, for
              36 months, a program of cooperative  research on supersymmetry phenomenology
              and superstrings.   In  particular, this research seeks to provide a
              theoretical and  phenomenological understanding of low-energy supersymmetry and
               superstring theories.    Theoretical arguments suggest that nature may be
              supersymmetric.   If this is so, it must be described by a supergravity theory,
              and  supergravity must be embedded in a more fundamental theory such  as the
              heterotic string.  The collaborators will use this theory  to investigate
              several aspects of low energy supersymmetry  phenomenology.  The PI is
              respected as a leader in the field of  elementary particle physics whose work
              has had a major influence  on numerous subdisciplines including supersymmetry,
              supergravity,  and superstring theory.  His Korean collaborator also is an 
              active string theorist.  This project is relevant to the  objectives of the
              U.S.-Korea Cooperative Science Program which  seeks to increase the level of
              cooperation between U.S. and  Korean scientists and engineers through the
              exchange of  scientific information, ideas, skills, and techniques and through 
              collaboration on problems of mutual benefit.  Korean  participation in the
              project is supported by the Korea Science  and Engineering Foundation (KOSEF).
