Abstract    :
              9319229  Zinn    Recent investigations have indicated that the flattening of the
              galactic halo  and the morphology of the horizontal branch (i.e. the relative
              frequencies of  red and blue HB stars) of the halo vary with distance from the
              galactic  center.  The work of Dr. Zinn and other astronomers on the system of 
              globular clusters suggests that this is due to the composite nature of the 
              halo. The globular clusters of the inner halo have characteristics that are 
              indicative of very old ages.  While this Old halo population extends into the 
              outer halo, at large galactocentric distances, the majority of clusters belong 
              to a separate population, termed the Young halo.  The properties of the Old 
              halo clusters suggests that this system is a relic of the collapse of the
              Galaxy  that ultimately produced the galactic disk and bulge, while those of
              the  Young halo suggest that it is the debris of one or more large satellite
              galaxy  (similar to the Large Magellanic Cloud) that merged with the Milky Way
              and  was tidally disrupted in the process.      The research carried out with
              this award is designed to test this hypothesis  for the structure and formation
              of the galactic halo and to provide valuable  information on the inner halo
              even if the hypothesis needs to be discarded.   Observations of a selected
              sample of RR Lyrae variable stars will indicate if  the stellar population of
              the inner halo is kinematically similar to the Old halo  globular clusters. 
              Samples of halo stars near the Sun will be examined for  evidence that they are
              a mixture of the Old and Young halos.  The results  obtained by these
              investigations will provide a more detailed picture of the  inner halo and the
              relationship between the globular cluster system and the  stellar halo. They
              will therefore further our understanding of the evolution of  our galaxy.
