Abstract    :
              9319833  Schmandt    This U.S.-Mexico award will support a workshop on  
              sustainable development for the Rio Grande/Rio Bravo  basin, organized by Dr.
              Jurgen Schmandt, director of  the Center for Global Studies, Houston Advanced 
              Research Center and Professor Salvador Contreras, of  the Universidad Autonoma
              de Nuevo Leon.  The workshop  will help to implement a sustainable development 
              initiative for the Rio Grande/Rio Bravo Basin (SDI).   The SDI project involves
              five U.S. and Mexican basin  institutions seeking to encourage improved
              management  of the region's water resources and development  options by
              establishing a network of regional groups  responsible for water management and
              economic  development.  The objective of the workshop is to  develop a detailed
              plan of action for implementing the  findings and recommendations resulting
              from previous  work of the participants.  The planned document should  serve as
              the foundation for the future establishment  of a coordinated research and
              policy development  program for the basin.       A key problem in the region is
              the frequency of  drought and other stressful water-related events.   With the
              worsening depletion of ground water,  pollution from mining activity, transfers
              of water  rights from irrigation to municipalities and  accelerating industrial
              development, water problems  are likely to become more severe.  A basin wide 
              community-based approach to these challenges is vital  for the creation of
              sustainable responses to growth  and change.  The SDI project aims to provide a
              long-  lasting agenda for this approach.      ***
