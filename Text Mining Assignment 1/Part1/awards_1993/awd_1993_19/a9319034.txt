Abstract    :
              9319034  Ferland    Emission line regions define the end points of stellar
              evolution and are present in the most luminous   objects in the universe (the
              distant quasars).  Detailed understanding of this gas requires reference to
              large-  scale numerical simulations.  This project will continue developing a
              computer program which simulates   the physical conditions within a
              non-equilibrium plasma and predicts its spectrum.      Several broad problems
              in active galactic nuclei, H II regions, and classical novae will be
              investigated .    The emission line clouds of high redshift quasars have
              metallicities approaching 10 times solar, similar to   those found in the cores
              of massive galaxies at similar epochs, and this metallicity correlates with  
              luminosity and/or redshift.  This work will probe galactic chemical evolution
              at large redshift.  A second   area to be investigated will involve an attempt
              to understand physical conditions within galactic H II   regions and
              surrounding photodissociation regions.  This will lead to a more complete
              understanding of   measurements of galactic abundance gradients.  Another area
              will be classical novae, to better constrain the   mass and abundances of the
              ejecta, and thereby their contribution to galactic nucleosynthesis.    ******
