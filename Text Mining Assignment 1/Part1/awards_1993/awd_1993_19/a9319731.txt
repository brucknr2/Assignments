Abstract    :
                  9319731  Lave    Business is under increasing pressure to make each aspect
              of  their activities, products and packaging "environmentally  friendly." 
              Unfortunately, no one is clear about what this goal  means operationally.  We
              propose research to enhance the ability  of corporations to understand
              recycling, improve their product  and process design for the environment, and
              measure the  improvements resulting from our collaboration.  Our work consists 
              of six tasks:  1. Improve measures of the environmental  consequences of
              alternative products or designs.  Without  quantitative measures, goals are
              vague and management performance  cannot be assessed.  2.  Estimate and
              implement our measures for  a range of IBM printers.  We will collaborate with
              IBM to meet  the corporate goal of increased environmental friendliness 
              through developing and implement our measures and approach.  3.  Implement a
              system that informs the designers at IBM of the  environmental implications of
              alternative designs, materials,  choices, and other design issues.  We will
              explore both intrusive  and non-intrusive systems.  4.  Examine the ways in
              which the  tools can be designed into a company's organizational structure.  
              We seek ways to have companies meet environmental goals routinely  and
              inexpensively without excess time of top executives or  decreased produce
              quality.  5.  Investigate organizational  learning by examining the extent to
              which our tools affect  product design, particularly as measured by our
              indices, and how  the use of these tools disseminate through the organization
              and  become more valuable to designers over time.  We will explore how  to
              increase productivity while enhancing environmental  friendliness.  6. 
              Transfer our results and indices to a second  company making a quite different
              product.  The Ford Motor Company  will work with us in transferring the
              research results from IBM  to quite a different setting.***
