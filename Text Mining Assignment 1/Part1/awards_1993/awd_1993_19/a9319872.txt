Abstract    :
              9319872  Fleischer  This award is for support of a Small Grant for Exploratory
              Research  (SGER) to document and analyze a surge, which is in progress, on  the
              Bering Glacier in Alaska.  Surging is defined as periodic, very  rapid
              movements of large quantities of ice within a glacier,  alternating with much
              longer periods of near stagnation.  The  Bering Glacier is the longest (191
              kilometers) and largest (5,173.5  square kilometers) glacier in North America. 
              This work is part of  an on-going program of the Bering Glacier Research Group
              (BERG) and  will involve state-of-the-art, continuous-recording, ice 
              penetrating radar measurements of ice thickness.  The results of  this work
              should help in the understanding of the role of  subglacial water in the surge
              mechanism.  ***
