Abstract    :
              9319002  Delph       This research addresses the genetic mechanisms that may be 
              responsible for variation in the ability of offspring to survive,  for the
              alpine tundra plant, Silene acaulis. Silene acaulis has a  mating system that
              is termed "gynodioecy", in which there are two  types of individuals, females
              and hermaphrodites.  This contrasts  with the majority of flowering plant
              species, in which only  hermaphrodites occur.  It has been reported that
              offspring from the  female morph are nine times more likely to survive the
              seedling  establishment phase than are offspring whose seed-parents are 
              hermaphrodites.  This is in spite of the fact that the seeds from  the females
              are smaller and contain fewer nutrients than those from  hermaphrodites.  This
              suggests that genetic mechanisms are  involved.  Three genetically based
              hypotheses to explain the higher  quality of seeds from females will be tested
              using field and  laboratory experiments.  The work funded by this grant will
              provide  insight into (1) how genes that affect more than one trait in an 
              organism are selected for, (2) how matings between related  individuals affect
              offspring fitness,and (3) how competition among  pollen grains that differ in
              their genetic constitution can affect  offspring fitness.  Furthermore, the
              genetic basis of sex  determination will be investigated, in that the number of
               cytoplasmic types conferring male-sterility will be determined.   Plant
              species with different mating systems vary in their ability  to persist in
              natural populations, and this work promote   understanding of the mechanisms
              responsible for this difference.
