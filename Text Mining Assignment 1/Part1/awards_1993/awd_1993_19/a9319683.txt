Abstract    :
                For effective human vision, the brain must integrate the binocular input from
              the two eyes, and in turn drive the two eyes to move binocularly in appropriate
              directions.   The development of sensory binocularity appears to depend on the
              ability to align the two eyes to give visual stimulation of corresponding
              points on the retina of each eye.  This alignment is a precursor to development
              of cells in the visual cortex that are sensitive to retinal disparity, and for
              stereoscopic vision.  This project studies how oculomotor and sensory factors
              combine to contribute to the development of binocular visual functions during
              infancy in humans.  Models are outlined for possible developmental
              relationships, and a novel binocular eye-tracking technique will be used to
              measure human infant eye movements.  Data on developing motor binocularity is
              compared to data on developing sensory binocularity measured by a variety of
              behavioral and non-invasive tests, to see how sensory and motor factors are
              combined.  Results from this study will be important to visual science, and
              also to developmental human research and to human performance analysis, with
              further likely importance to understanding disorders in binocular vision.
