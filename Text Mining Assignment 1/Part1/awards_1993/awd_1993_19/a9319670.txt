Abstract    :
              9319670  Dennison    The objective of this project is to image the faint
              Balmer-alpha  emission produced by the warm, ionized, interstellar hydrogen.  
              Digital images will be obtained covering a significant fraction  of the
              northern hemisphere of the sky.  The imaging system will  consist of readily
              available components: a small focal-ratio  camera lens attached to a high
              quantum-efficiency Charge-Coupled  Device (CCD) camera; a narrow-bandpass
              interference filter placed  in front of the lens will selectively pass only the
              H alpha line  and reduce the noise contributed by the continuum sky background.
                The system will detect H alpha emission far from the plane of our  Milky Way
              galaxy, and produce images of relatively high angular  (arcminute) resolution. 
              The system will be mounted at a dark  site within easy reach of the Virginia
              Tech campus.  Ultimately  the resulting digital atlas will be made available to
              the  astronomical community.
