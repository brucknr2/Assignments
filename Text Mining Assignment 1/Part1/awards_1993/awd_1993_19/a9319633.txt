Abstract    :
              9319633  Moore    This research project focuses on the mechanisms by which
              steroid  hormones interact with peptides in the brain.  We know that  peptides
              in the vasopressin/oxytocin peptide family are potent  modulators of
              reproductive behaviors and that the behavioral  actions of these peptides
              frequently are dependent on prior  exposure to androgen.  But exactly how and
              where androgens and  these peptides interact remains largely unknown.  The
              proposed  research will use an amphibian model system to identify which 
              neurons in the brain contain androgen receptors (can respond  directly to this
              type of steroid hormone) and which neurons  synthesize these peptides and, also
              to investigate site-specific  and gender-specific effects of steroid hormones
              on the genes for  these peptides.  Information gained from these studies will
              help to  develop generalized models about the molecular control of brain 
              functions and behaviors.  ***
