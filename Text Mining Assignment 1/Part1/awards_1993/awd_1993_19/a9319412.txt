Abstract    :
              9319412  Canny    The research addresses continuing exploration of sensing and 
              manipulation strategies for simple robot hardware, in the RISC  (Reduced
              Intricacy in Sensing and Control) paradigm.  RISC  robotics, advocated by the
              author and Prof. Ken Goldberg of USC, is  an attempt to fuse automation and
              robotic technologies.  It uses  traditional automation hardware such as
              parallel-jaw grippers and  optical beam sensors, together with geometric
              planning and sensing  algorithms, to accomplish more cost-effective and
              reliable  operations that are also easy to set up and reconfigure, and 
              flexible enough to support small batch sizes and rapid changes in  part design
              needed in future flexible/agile manufacturing systems.   The research will
              address model-building algorithms for optical  beam and other sensors, accurate
              model acquisition, high-rate  recognition, grasping and fixturing with minimal
              numbers of  elements, and automatic design of RISC workcell elements.  The 
              effectiveness of the RISC approach will be tested with some  challenging case
              studies, starting with an assembly program for a  model-aircraft engine.
