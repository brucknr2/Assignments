Abstract    :
              9319223  St. Johns    In supporting the operation and development of the
              Interagency  Internet, the agencies of the Executive Committee of the Federal 
              Networking Council (FNC) incur a number of mutually chargeable  expenses.  To
              minimize funds transfers, a "book" is kept on each  agency and, when all
              potential mutual expenses are known, a single  net transfer of funds is made. 
              This proposal constitutes the  reconciliation for FY93; it shows that ARPA is
              the creditor agency  and that NSF's share of the debt is $90,000.
