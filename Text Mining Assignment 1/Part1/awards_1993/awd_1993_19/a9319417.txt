Abstract    :
              9319417  Olson  Within the last four years, and especially since the 1989 Loma 
              Prieta Earthquake, casualty estimation, long a neglected subject  in both
              research and application, has emerged in both sectors as  a key focus.  The
              long-term objective of this research effort is  to develop quantitative methods
              and techniques for estimating  earthquake-caused casualties for loss
              estimation, emergency  medical response planning, and improved design of
              structural and  nonstructural building elements.    The objective of this
              project is to maintain the momentum and  interaction between researchers and
              practitioners by organizing,  holding, and publishing proceedings from a Second
              Workshop on  Earthquake Casualty Estimation.  The workshop will further the 
              planning efforts of the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction  Program and will
              be conducted in the context of the development  of a national earthquake loss
              estimation methodology.  ***
