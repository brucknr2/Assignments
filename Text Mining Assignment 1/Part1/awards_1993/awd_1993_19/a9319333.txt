Abstract    :
              9319333  Kowalski    This supplement funds the University of Washington's 
              Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Process  Analytical
              Chemistry.  The funding is provided by the Environmental  Protection Agency
              (EPA) to augment on-going research in the area of  sensor and flow injection
              monitoring for Environmental Waste  Reduction and Prevention at the Center.   
              This project entitled "Environmental Waste Reduction and Prevention  through
              the Application of Flow Injection Analysis" is to develop  solution handling
              techniques based on the developed Flow Injection  method as a replacement of
              standard methods of water analysis.   This project is a continuation of the
              project initially supported  by the EPA.    The Program Director recommends the
              University of Washington be  awarded $40,000 for one year with funds provided
              by EPA.
