Abstract    :
                This proposal is for work to formally specify and then implement a  modular,
              extensible backend engineering database supporting data  translation between an
              open-ended set of applications.  The unique  features of the data model and its
              prototype implementation are:  (1) dynamic extensibility, allowing new
              applications to be added    throughout the process of design, and later
              throughout the    product life cycle, with expectations that new applications 
              interfaces can be implemented by users, not database  administrators, (2)
              support for the iterative nature of design, in  the form of explicit monitoring
              and management of partial  integrity, (3) a richer data model tailored to the
              needs of  engineering design,   reducing the impedance mismatch between the 
              current functionality of advanced CAD systems and current  databases. (4)  a
              new model of translation between applications,  that does not rely on a neutral
              file approach, but rather treats  translation as a set of transformations over
              a type network.  The concepts supporting these capabilities will be developed
              and  formalized.  The prototype implementation will be general,  supporting a
              variety of engineering design areas.  Applications to  be tested on top of the
              database will be drawn from civil and  mechanical engineering design research
              literature.  The prototype  implementation will be developed to be easily
              portable, and made  available to other research groups.
