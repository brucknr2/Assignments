Abstract    :
              9319120  Ortoleva    A fully coupled reaction-transport-mechanical model and
              computer code will  be developed to investigate the hydrous alteration of
              primitive Solar System  bodies.  Hypotheses regarding heating mechanisms and
              their effect on ice  melting, fluid flow, compaction, and large-scale mineral
              zonation patterns  will be tested.  Finite element and finite difference
              numerical methods and  adaptive grid techniques will be used to solve equations
              describing chemical  reaction and transport, fluid flow, heat transport by
              conduction and  advection, chemical and mechanical compaction, and poroelastic
              and plastic  deformation.  These investigations are expected to contribute to
              an  evolutionary history of alteration processes in asteroids resulting from
              the  full coupling of physical and chemical processes; and to result in a
              computer  code available for other researchers studying low temperature
              planetary  alteration/differentiation processes.
