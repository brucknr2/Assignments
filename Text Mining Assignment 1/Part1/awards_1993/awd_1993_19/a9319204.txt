Abstract    :
              9319204  Hearn    The use of a structural reliability criterion for evaluation
              of  inspection techniques can provide a rational basis for the design  of
              inspection programs; specifically the selection of inspection  techniques and
              inspection intervals to meet joint demands of  ensuring structural safety and
              of providing sufficient data to  support planning of maintenance.  A
              reliability basis for design  of inspection programs differs from the simpler
              consideration of  minimum defect size that specific inspection techniques can 
              detect.  A reliability basis recognizes critical members in a  structure and
              demands successful detection of damage in these.  The basis promotes a
              selection/evaluation/selection cycle in  which inspection programs are tailored
              to meet specific  performance goals.  An emphasis on instrument-based NDE 
              techniques and an integration with bridge management systems  (BMS) will be
              followed.  Data from instrument-based inspections  will be related to
              structural reliability and will be used to  generate parametric measures of
              structural condition.  ***
