Abstract    :
              9354427  Kappelman  This project expands and extends the reach of physical
              anthropology  by developing a first and second year curriculum for use at other
               institutions nationally. The laboratories build on current course  offerings
              and provide materials mastered by undergraduates as stand  alone modules on CD
              ROM. These electronic laboratories permit  students to work on specific
              problems using high resolution color  images, video clips, 3-dimensional
              animations, and sound. It is  also expected that the CD ROM will provide these
              materials in an  easily affordable instructional medium.
