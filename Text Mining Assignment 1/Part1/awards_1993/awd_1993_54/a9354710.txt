Abstract    :
              9354710  Nakmura  In this decade, career opportunities in the environmental 
              sciences will outpace those in many other disciplines. However,  women and
              minorities are poorly represented in the ranks of  environmental scientists.
              California State University, Los  Angeles (CSLA) has a student body over 37%
              Hispanic, 10% Black,  and 29% Asian. Entering students have little knowledge of
               environmental careers. This curriculum revision project will  magnify student
              interest in environmental sciences and give  undergraduates the necessary
              knowledge, skills and experiences  to become environmental scientists. Through
              this project,  course "modules" will be developed that fit the environmental 
              themes of aquatic pollution, atmospheric change or land use.  Under the aquatic
              pollution theme, a biology class might  collect marine fish specimens from
              sewage outfalls and look for  lesions and tumors. A chemistry class would
              measure the  concentrations of DDT in fish from contaminated and 
              uncontaminated sites. A writing course would use the shared  data to draft an
              environmental impact statement. Integrated  modules will give students hands-on
              experience with a local  problem, use of critical thinking skills and practice
              in report  writing from multidisciplinary data.
