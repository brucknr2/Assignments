Abstract    :
              9354861  Attewell    We propose a graduate research training program in the area
              of  Organizational Effectiveness, within a doctoral program in  sociology, but
              drawing upon an interdisciplinary faculty involved  in organizational studies
              within the social and behavorial  sciences.    The training program is oriented
              toward African-American and  Hispanic doctoral students, and will involve an
              initial cohort of  five trainees.  Our doctoral program has successfully
              recruited and  graduated substantial numbers of minority doctoral students in 
              sociology for two decades:  we propose building up and extending an  existing
              sub-speciality in organizational studies to focus  specially on organizational
              effectiveness.  We shall use existing  recruiting bridges to outstanding
              minority students in the senior  colleges of the City University of New York,
              as well as national  searches, detailed below.    The proposed program involves
              a sequence of courses on  organizational theory, assessment methodologies, and
              research  techniques. It includes student apprenticeships in existing faculty 
              research projects on effectiveness and restructuring efforts in  three
              organizational domains: private industry, government, and  schools.  This will
              be followed by research internships in private  and public organizations, which
              will form the bases of their  dissertation research.  ***
