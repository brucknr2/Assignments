Abstract    :
              9354630  Olivo         The Neuroscience Simulation Project will develop
              realistic,  interactive, computer-based simulations of experiments in 
              neuroscience, a field of rapid growth and increasing undergraduate  interest.
              The simulations are targeted at introductory and  intermediate courses in
              biology, psychology and neuroscience,  especially at large courses that do not
              include a laboratory.  Students in such courses often have difficulty
              understanding the  remarkably rapid and dynamic responses of neurons, because
              these  aspects are not conveyed well by static pictures in textbooks. 
              Realistic, interactive simulations in which students see and hear  neuronal
              responses as they control stimuli interactively give a  much better
              understanding of the pace and dynamics of activity in  the brain and nervous
              system.  The Neuroscience Simulation Project,  which will be extended and
              enlarged by this funding, was founded at  Smith College in 1990 with partial
              support from the New England  Consortium for Undergraduate Science Education.
              Its first software  release, MacRetina, generated strong interest in the
              neuroscience  community and won a Distinguished Natural Science Software Award
              in  1992 from EDUCOM. The pedagogical and technical challenges mastered  in
              producing MacRetina will serve as a strong foundation for the  proposed
              development of new simulation software.  ***y
