Abstract    :
              9354712  Holland           The problems we address are not unique to Baruch
              College: student  lack of interest in science; lack of problem solving skills;
              lack  of feeling of connection with science and scientists; and low  numbers of
              students going on to study science beyond the  introductory courses.  Our
              overall goals are: to increase  scientific literacy and problem solving skills
              of undergraduate  non-science majors; to stimulate students to study science
              beyond  the required courses; to encourage more students to prepare for 
              scientific careers in research, teaching, or science writing; to  provide
              teaching/learning experiences for science majors; to create  a sense of
              community among scientists, both students and faculty,  at Baruch.  We propose
              the following specific curricular changes:  (1) introduction of journalistic
              methods into introductory courses  in Biology, Chemistry, Physics, and
              Environmental Studies; (2)  development of a new interdisciplinary
              Science/Journalism course  with a laboratory component.  Our target audience is
              undergraduate  students: non-science majors in introductory courses, journalism
               students considering careers in science journalism, and science  majors who
              will serve as teaching assistants/peer mentors in this  program. During the two
              project years this will involve 800  students; when the proposed curricular
              changes are fully  institutionalized, approximately 2500 students per year will
               benefit.  The methods developed here have wide application beyond  Baruch
              College. Changes in introductory science courses, the only  science most
              undergraduates take, will have the most impact on  scientific literacy and
              problem solving skills. The  science/journalism course, a truly
              interdisciplinary course  including a laboratory component, can serve as a
              model for other  institutions.  ***y
