Abstract    :
              9354379  Felder  An evaluation is being conducted of a number of instructional 
              methods that have been shown by educational research to promote  effective
              learning, including cooperative (team-based) learning and  frequent assignment
              of open-ended problems and problem creation  exercises in class and homework.
              Two groups are being studied and  compared---an experimental group consisting
              of students who  experience the proposed approach for several semesters, and a 
              comparison group containing students who proceed through the  curriculum as
              normally taught. The objective of the research is to  demonstrate that the
              systematic and repeated use of the specified  methods can have a significant
              beneficial effect on academic  performance, retention, problem-solving ability
              and creativity, and  attitude toward chemical engineering as a curriculum and
              career  choice. The products of the research will include a body of data on 
              over 300 entering engineering sophomores relating to their  backgrounds,
              reasons for choosing engineering, academic strengths  and weaknesses, levels of
              confidence and anxiety, academic  performance, retention in engineering, and
              responsiveness to  different instructional methods.  ***y
