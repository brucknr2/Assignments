Abstract    :
              9354670  Vesilind  The purpose of this project is to develop curriculum
              materials on  academic integrity that can be used in the introductory
              engineering  course. These materials will include a video that will consists of
               scenarios, acted out by students, that describe ethical dilemmas  commonly
              faced by students. The accompanying written material will  relate these
              scenarios to actual professional engineering  situations and help the
              instructor guide the discussion toward  engineering ethics. The material will
              allow the instructor to  bridge the gap between academic dishonesty and
              engineering ethics  and to conduct a productive discussion on professional
              engineering  ethics.
