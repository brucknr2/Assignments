Abstract    :
              9354003  Parks       The University of Tennessee proposes to extend the Faculty 
              Enhancement Workshop entitled "Advanced Undergraduate  Laboratory Experiments
              Using Lasers" for two years, 1994 and  1995.  The workshop emphasizes the
              development and  implementation of experiments utilizing lasers primarily 
              suitable for advanced undergraduate physics and chemistry  laboratories.  It is
              a practical, hands-on experience where the  participants perform approximately
              ten unique laser-based  experiments.  It also features three construction
              projects,  holography, computed-aided instruction in laser safety, and  field
              trips to several nearby federal, state and private laser  labs.  ***
