Abstract    :
              9354592  Snell  CHANCE is a course designed to teach fundamental ideas of 
              probability and statistics in the context of real world questions  of current
              interest.  Such questions might include: Do basketball  players tend to shoot
              in streaks?  Do lefties die younger than  righties?  How reliable are opinion
              polls?  Do men tend to die just  before their birthdays and women just after
              them? Does lowering  your cholesterol make you more likely to die by murder,
              accident,  or suicide?  CHANCE students learn that with the help of basic 
              notions of probability and statistics, they can think critically  for
              themselves about issues such as these.  Teaching a CHANCE  course only requires
              a solid knowledge of probability and  statistics, boundless enthusiasm, the
              time and energy needed to  keep up with the news, a receptive administration, a
              good library,  and a willingness to plunge into uncharted territory.  Materials
               are being developed and online resources are available by computer  network
              that will make it significantly simpler to institute and  teach a CHANCE
              course.
