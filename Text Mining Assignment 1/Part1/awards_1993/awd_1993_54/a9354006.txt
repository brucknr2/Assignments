Abstract    :
              9354006  Feiner  This project involves the development of undergraduate faculty 
              in the new scholarship on the economics of women and  minorities. The five-day
              workshop is expected to help develop  a full curriculum for teaching and
              assessing student learning  of this scholarship. More specifically, seminar
              participants  are instructed in recent developments in the scholarship on 
              women and minorities by scholars contributing these  developments. They also
              work in teams to modify courses to  incorporate the new scholarship, critique
              and refine these  modifications, and will develop techniques to assess the
              impact  of these changes on student outcomes.   Follow-up activities  and a
              dissemination conference is scheduled, and proceedings  will be published in an
              edited volume. It is also expected that  the incorporating of this new
              scholarship will encourage  greater numbers of minority and female
              undergraduates to pursue  economics.   ***
