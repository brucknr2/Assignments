Abstract    :
              9354567  Chiang      Instructional materials in modular form are being developed
              for a  five-course interdisciplinary educational package in "Fluid/Particle 
              Processing and Separation" for all engineering and related programs. The 
              instructional materials include detailed lecture outlines and notes,  problems
              and examples, laboratory units, computer software, audio/video  recordings and
              instructor's guides. The University of Pittsburgh is  teamed with four other
              institutions, the Iowa State University, the  University of Minnesota, the
              Pennsylvania State University and the  University of Texas (Austin), to develop
              this undergraduate curriculum.  Faculty members from these five institutions,
              representing chemical,  petroleum, and mechanical engineering, and mineral
              processing, together  with a diverse group of industrial partners, are working
              as an  interdisciplinary team to ensure a balanced approach to the curriculum 
              development. A network of corporate members of major engineering  societies,
              including AFS, AlChE, AIME, ASEE, ASME, and SPE, is also  included in the
              project. The role of these professional societies is to  help promote the
              importance of the curriculum, and to assist in achieving  the ultimate goal of
              wide dissemination and adoption of the educational  materials.  ***y
