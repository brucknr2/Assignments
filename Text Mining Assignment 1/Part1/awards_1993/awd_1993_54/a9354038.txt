Abstract    :
              9354038  Cox  The primary goal of this proposal is to redesign the curriculum 
              for preparing teachers of K-12 mathematics and science.  It is  based on a
              philosophy that emphasizes the integration of  mathematics, science and teacher
              preparation using inquiry-  based, experiential learning by setting up design
              teams, which  will be linked electronically.  This is to be accomplished 
              through experiential and service learning (especially through  environmental
              service learning projects).  The project features  a summer institute in which
              prospective teachers, practicing  teachers, and science, math and education
              faculty will  participate.  The purpose of this institute for 40 students and 
              teachers, is to prepare the participants to develop integrated 
              mathematics-science service-learning approaches that will be  implemented in
              the fall of 1994.  Mentoring teams, consisting  of a scientist, mathematician,
              a teacher educator, a practicing  teacher and a pre-service teacher, will be
              formed during the  institute and will continue their discourse during the fall
              via  an electronic mail network.  Information will be shared among  the
              participants and with teams at the Partner Schools of  National Network for
              Educational Renewal (NNER) in Utah, South  Carolina and Texas.  An external
              evaluation of the pilot  project will be conducted to assess the summer
              institute and  the fall semester's activities.
