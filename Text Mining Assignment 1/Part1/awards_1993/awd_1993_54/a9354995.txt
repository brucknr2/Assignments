Abstract    :
              9354995  Fichman    Carnegie Mellon University if proposing an innovative GRT
              program  that focuses on the joint impact of groups and technology on 
              organizational effectiveness.  As the primary work unit in  organizations
              continues to move from individuals to groups,  organizational effectiveness
              increasingly depends on the effective  use of group-oriented organizational
              designs.  At the same time,  the expansion of new technologies in organizations
              both enhances  opportunities for the formation and maintenance of work groups
              and  poses new challenges for effective work group functioning.  The  ability
              of organizational scientists to contribute the  organizational effectiveness in
              the future will depend on an  understanding of groups, technology, and their
              interaction.    We propose a GRT program that is innovative in form.  It is a 
              university wide program, operated by faculty in the schools of  business,
              social sciences, and public management.  This structure  will expose students
              to a range of theoretical and methological  approaches to studying groups and
              technology in both basic and  applied settings.  Training will be
              interdisciplinary in nature.   Students will have opportunities to bridge
              theory and application  in newly designed internships and project courses.  ***
