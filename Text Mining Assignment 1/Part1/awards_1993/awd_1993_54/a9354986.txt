Abstract    :
                A graduate program is proposed to develop expertise and research  skills in
              the discipline of Environmental Sensors and  instrumentation.  The program will
              combine the science and  engineering teaching and research resources of the
              Georgia  Institute of Technology and Clark Atlanta University in an 
              interdisciplinary program leading to a career in the burgeoning  field  of
              environmental measurement.  Students will select a  primary major area (e.g.
              Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, Civil  Engineering, Chemistry, Environmental
              Engineering or Biology)  while pursuing a 24 credit-hour graduate certificate
              course.   This course will be structured around a 15 credit-hour core of  basic
              studies, with additional optional specialist topics.   Students will select
              their research projects from a wide range of  science and engineering
              disciplines, working with highly  qualified faculty members.  The program will
              heavily recruit  minorities and females, and their progress through the program
               will be monitored for maximum retention and success.  Students  with
              appropriate interests will have the opportunity for  collaborative and
              international research programs with industrial  and Government sponsors,
              primarily Hewlett-Packard Analytical  Instruments Division, Electricite de
              France, and Savannah River  Site.  An additional four traineeships beyond the
              NSF commitment  will be co-sponsored by the participating universities.
