Abstract    :
              9354089  Semper    This planning project will take advantage of the acquisition
              of the  Presidio facilities which have been transferred from the Department  of
              Defense to the Exploratorium.  One objective of the planning  activities is to
              develop a collaboration among the teacher training  institutions in the San
              Francisco Bay area and from that  collaboration develop an in-service and
              pre-service center which  will serve that section of the state.  Another
              objective of the  project is to develop, through the combination of in-service
              and  pre-service activities, an innovative approach to the preparation  of new
              teachers and the professional development of active  teachers.  The final
              outcome will be a comprehensive resource  center for teachers at all levels.
