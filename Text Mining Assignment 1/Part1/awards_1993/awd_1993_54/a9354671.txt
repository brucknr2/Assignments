Abstract    :
              9354671  Pfeffer  This curriculum development effort deals with two courses,
              namely:   "Introduction to Particle Technology:  Fundamentals and  Applications
              (lecture course); and "Experiments and Simulations in  Particulate Flows"
              (laboratory course).  The project represents a  collaboration between NJIT,
              other universities, industry,  governmental laboratories and professional
              societies as evidenced  by supporting letters.  It will be interdisciplinary
              effort  involving professors from Chemical Engineering, Mechanical  Engineering
              and Mathematics, undergraduate and graduate students,  as well as industrial
              and governmental experts in the field.   The courses in particulate flows can
              be adapted at other  universities.  Course notes, lab manuals, user-friendly 
              simulations, video tapes of experiments and computer animations  will be
              developed and disseminated.  The courses will incorporate  into the
              undergraduate engineering curriculum the current research  of the PI's and
              their colleagues.  It is estimated that 30  undergraduates yearly will complete
              at least one of the two course  sequence.  The incorporation of some of the
              experiments of the  laboratory course into the standard laboratory courses will
              impact  as many as 250 undergraduates at NJIT per year.
