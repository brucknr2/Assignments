Abstract    :
              9354373  Tewksbury  An introductory course on the geology of Africa is being
              developed.   The goals of this new course are 1) to attract black students to 
              take geology and to encourage them to major in geology, 2) to  provide all
              students in the course with a perspective on how the  geologic evolution of a
              region has a fundamental influence on  historical, cultural, economic, and
              social issues, and 3) to  provide both non-science students and prospective
              geology majors  with a rigorous, hands-on science course in which students
              really  "do geology".  This new course, "The Geology and Development of  Modern
              Africa", will be part of both a major in geology and a major  in Africana
              Studies.  Students who take this course will not simply learn facts about the 
              geology of Africa.  The course will be designed as a lab course to give 
              prospective geology majors and non-science majors alike a rigorous,  hands-on
              experience in science and an opportunity to think creatively  about the
              underlying geologic context for events and trends in the  history and
              development of modem Africa.  The course will be designed to  have a maximum
              enrollment of 50.  A group of several students, both black and white, will
              participate  during the summer of 1994 in designing the course, which will be
              offered  for the first time during fall semester 1994.  Students who helped 
              develop the course will serve as teaching assistants and tutors during  the
              first year that the course is taught, and one of the goals of the  course will
              be to develop a nucleus of black students who are  well-trained and interested
              in geology.  The course will be evaluated and  revised during spring and summer
              1995 and offered again in the fall of  1995.
