Abstract    :
              9354010  Smith  Georgia State University (GSU) and the Georgia Institute of 
              Technology (GIT) will present an Undergraduate Faculty  Enhancement project in
              chemistry in which the major activities  of the proposed project are one-week
              workshops, 3-day  mini-courses, and annual reunions of the previous year's 
              participants. Workshop topics are: (1) Advanced Materials  Chemistry, (2)
              Chemistry of Nucleic Acids, (3) Environmental  Chemistry, (4) Molecular
              Modeling, (5) Molecular Orbital  Theory, (6) Multidimensional Nuclear Magnetic
              Resonance, (7)  Multimedia Techniques in Chemistry, and (8) Optimal 
              Experimental Design and Statistical Analysis. The mini-courses  are: (1) Oxygen
              Chemistry, (2) Organometallic Chemistry or  Biocatalysis.  Recruitment of
              participants is to be on a  national basis. The project is designed to improve
              the ability  of faculty at two- and four-year, public and private, 
              institutions to develop and teach a modern program in  chemistry.  ***
