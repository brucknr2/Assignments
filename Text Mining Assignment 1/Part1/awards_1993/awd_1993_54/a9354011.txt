Abstract    :
              9354011  Albertson  This program will conduct a five-day workshop for 30 faculty
               participants to provide information and problem-solving  experience for
              palnning, designing, building, and operating  Advanced Integrated Wastewater
              Pond Systems (AIWPS).  The 30  faculty pariticpants will be selected from
              faclulty teaching  environmental engineering courses to undergraduate students
              in  the U.S.  A particular effort will be made to identify women  and minority
              faculty.  Participants will interact with experts  and among themselves to
              learn the various aspects of AIWPS.   The workshop will include illustrated
              lectures by experts,  discussions, field trips, and practical problem-sovling 
              sessions.  The prospects for establishing undergradute reserach  projects in
              regular curricula, how to sustain communication and  program development, and
              how to integrate this technology with  other related technologies in classrooms
              will be among the  discussion topics.  A newsletter will provide long-term 
              interaction among the participants.  ***
