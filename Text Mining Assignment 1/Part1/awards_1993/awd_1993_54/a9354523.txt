Abstract    :
              9354523  Aldridge  This project addresses the implementation, evaluation and 
              refinement of an introductory-level sophomore course for preparing 
              engineering, business and industrial design students to function  effectively
              on cross-disciplinary design teams.   The project contains three major
              elements: application, evaluation  and refinement of materials and methods for
              the course; evaluation  of the course content and teaching methods for
              preparing students  to work in cross-disciplinary teams in advanced courses and
              after  graduation; and dissemination of the approach and instructional 
              materials to other institutions. To maximize opportunities for  students to
              learn how to accommodate and profit from work team  diversity, special efforts
              are made to recruit women and minorities  into the project. Long-term
              evaluation of project and program  effectiveness and dissemination of materials
              is provided by the  National Consortium for Technology in Business
              headquartered at  Auburn University in the College of Engineering.  ***y
