Abstract    :
              9354057  Bagger  The idea of a fermionic Goldstone particle was initially
              conceived  and developed in Russia  3 , and is currently under active 
              investigation by members of the Theoretical Physics Group at Dubna.   Therefore
              this work will clearly benefit Russian science.  It will  benefit American
              science because its impact on pure theory and  applied phenomenology.  In fact,
              because of the new colliders at  SSCL and CERN, it is the ideal time to study
              the physics of the TeV  scale.  Supersymmetric searches will surely play a
              major role at  both machines, so a model-independent description will be great 
              importance to experimentalists as they begin to confront theory  with
              experiment.  ***
