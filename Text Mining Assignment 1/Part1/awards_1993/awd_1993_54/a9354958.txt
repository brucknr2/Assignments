Abstract    :
                A Graduate Research Training program is proposed that integrates  high
              performance computing into a multidisciplinary thrust in  materials physics and
              chemistry.  The program is designed to  provide students with state-of-the-art
              knowledge in quantum and  condensed matter theory, atomistic simulation methods
              and  effective use of massively parallel computers.  The program takes 
              advantage of the expertise of six faculty members from the  Departments of
              Physics, Chemistry and Chemical Engineering and  incorporates courses, research
              projects, seminars and tutorials  to train students for leadership in advanced
              materials  technology.  A resource center with student offices and shared 
              capabilities for distributed computing will encourage  interdisciplinary
              interactions.  Students, especially women and  minorities, will be vigorously
              recruited through three REU  programs as well as the normal institutional
              recruiting channels.   The proposed program will produce scientists with a
              broad  knowledge of materials theory and extensive experience in high 
              performing computing.
