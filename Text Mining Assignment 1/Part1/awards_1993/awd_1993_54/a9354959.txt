Abstract    :
              9354959  Cole    This proposal requests support for five graduate fellowships to
               support multi-disciplinary education and research in the area of  spoken
              language interfaces.  The proposed program is structurally  innovative in that
              it combines the disciplines of human-computer  interaction and cognitive
              science to develop computer systems that  interact with humans via spoken
              language.  The proposed program  addresses national research needs as
              identified by the NSF.  OGI's  Center for Spoken Language Understanding has
              created the first  academic program in the U.S. designed specifically to
              provide  students with the background and research skills needed to develop 
              spoken language systems.    Innovative inter-institutional components of the
              proposed program  include:  (1) partnerships with the University of Texas at El
              Paso  (UTEP) and Clark Atlanta University (CAU), whose undergraduate 
              populations are predominantly composed of students from under-  represented
              minorities; (2) outreach and recruitment efforts  through the partner
              institutions to interest and involve students  in advanced study in spoken
              language interfaces; and (3) multi-  level team-based support of the trainees
              in OGI's program.  ***
