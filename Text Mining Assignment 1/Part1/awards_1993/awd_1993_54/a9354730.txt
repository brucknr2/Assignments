Abstract    :
              9354730  Zheng      A recent survey conducted by the author indicated the need
              for a  data communications and networks text covering fundamental theory  and
              new technologies along with software project topics in a  multiplatform
              distributed environment for computer science and  software engineering students
              in undergraduate level.  Traditional  textbooks do not take advantage of recent
              development in multimedia  and hypertext technologies. Through the use of these
              technologies  students are able to interact with computers in the pursuit of 
              knowledge at their own rate, following their own particular  interests within
              the field.  Various media, digitized still and  motion images, and sounds,
              provide a more complete and lasting  access to the subject matter.  The
              techniques of hypertext and  multimedia are just beginning to be realized in
              education.  This  project develops a text in this format as a prototype for
              texts.   This project also develops a cost-effective network laboratory 
              prototype, to provide software and supplementary teaching materials  including
              a question set and project topics with sample solutions  in a multiplatform
              environment.  The goal of the curriculum is to  engage students actively in the
              learning process and, through the  projects developed, to promote critical
              thinking, problem solving  skills, and creativity.  ***y
