Abstract    :
              9354115  Garibaldi    Xavier University intends to develop a strategic plan that
              would  identify:   o   the major enhancements or restructuring required in the 
                   applicable Science, Engineering and Mathematics (SEM)       disciplines of
              the university, and   o   the strategies required to overcome the specified    
                deficiencies.    Each of these efforts will be undertaken with the ultimate
              goal  of achieving those results that will project the university into  the
              future as a model institution of excellence in the selected  SEM disciplines
              and as a significant contributor to the  production of young scientists and
              engineers.    The SEM disciplines of interest in this project will include 
              Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science, Mathematics, Physics and  the Dual Degree
              Engineering Program.
