Abstract    :
              9354476  Foote  This project is developing hypermedia-based instructional 
              modules to support a curriculum initiative called The  Geographer's Craft. The
              Geographer's Craft is a two-semester  course and model for introductory
              training in geographical  methods, and is based upon a problem-solving,
              integrated  approach to the teaching of cartography, GIS, spatial  statistics,
              and remote sensing. It also addresses real-world  issues with a range of
              textually "appropriate" technical and  conceptual tools and stresses
              independent thought and reasoning  skills. Prototype modules are being created
              to test software  designs and once a full suite of materials is complete, the 
              Geographer's Craft will become the core introductory course  required of all
              majors and minors. The project is also expected  to introduce all geography
              students to the latest research  techniques, provide a means for non-majors to
              gain background  in valuable skills that complement their studies in other 
              disciplines, and prepare students for upper-division studies  and advanced
              courses in geographical techniques.
