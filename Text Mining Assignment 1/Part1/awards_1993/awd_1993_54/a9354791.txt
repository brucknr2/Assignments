Abstract    :
              9354791    Rodger                               Theoretical concepts provide the
              fundamental basis for computer  science, yet many undergraduates obtain a
              superficial understanding  of these concepts due to the pencil and paper
              environment in which  these concepts are currently taught.  Our main objective
              is to  provide an environment for presenting and communicating abstract 
              computer science concepts in a more efficient, visual and  interactive manner. 
              We plan to redesign the sophomore formal  languages and automata theory course
              at Rensselaer Polytechnic  Institute to use interactive and visual software
              tools we have  developed and will continue to develop.  These tools allow
              students  to experiment with concepts in formal languages and automata, 
              receiving immediate feedback.  We will evaluate the usage of these  tools in
              two ways: in a lecture format with computer  demonstrations, and in a
              lecture/lab format.  The material to be  developed includes manuscripts for the
              lecture and lab presentation  formats, problem sets, and software tools.  This
              material will be  disseminated through computer science education conferences, 
              journals, and newsgroups on the Internet.  In addition, a one day  workshop
              will be held during the second year for evaluation and  dissemination of our
              methods and tools.  ***
