Abstract    :
              9354772  Prizirembel  The American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), with
              a  network of 120,000 members, including over 400 department heads  of
              mechanical engineering and mechanical engineering technology  programs in the
              country, will initiate a curriculum development  project to integrate the
              product realization process (PRP) and  to take into consideration the issues
              associated with design  into the undergraduate mechanical engineering
              curriculum.   Design, used in its broadest sense, will be used as the central 
              axis of integration both vertically (integrating subjects in a  time
              progressive manner over a number of semesters of years)  and horizontally
              (integrating different interdisciplinary  subjects offered at the same time
              period.)  Specifically, the  project will 1) identify the essential elements of
              PRP  activities with respect to design education, 2) identify the  paradigms
              and methodologies used in existing innovative  programs and curricula that have
              been successfully tested on  campuses, 3) develop model design courses, at
              various levels in  the engineering curricum, and different models of design 
              curricula in mechanical engineering, 4) disseminate new courses  and curriculum
              models that are developed in this prject to all  U.S. engineering colleges, and
              5) develop an implementation  plan for engineering schools and departments to
              adopt and  utilize the project results. The course and curriculum models  thus
              developed will provide useful resource guides to the  mechanical engineering
              department heads and faculty members in  their own effort of course and
              curriculum development.  The  project results will also provide the paradigms,
              methodologies,  and processes for other engineering disciplines to integrate 
              the product realization process into their respective  engineering curriculum.
