Abstract    :
              9354785   Schneider                                The New Science Project will
              change the way Grinnell College  teaches introductory science in biology
              chemistry, mathematics,  physics, and psychology. This program responds to the
              barriers that  traditionally discourage the successful pursuit of science by 
              students belonging to underrepresented groups in science. The New  Science
              Project will serve other colleges and universities by 1)  offering a
              student-center approach to the problem of  under-representation in science and
              2) providing an example of  long-term, division-wide curricular reform, based
              on encouraging  and building on individual teaching experiments.  Nationally,
              introductory science and mathematics courses need  prompt and serious attention
              to maintain their productivity of  future scientists, engineers and
              mathematicians overall, and to  entice new students from traditionally
              under-represented groups  into these fields. With faculty release time from
              this grant,  Grinnell College will develop a coordinated series of new, 
              interactive courses in a highly experimental fashion to determine  what course
              structures most effectively make introductory science  accessible to all
              populations, and the engaging starting point to  science and mathematics that
              it should be. We will encourage a  variety of models, some as add-on workshops,
              some as complete  course revisions, so that we can make useful comparisons of 
              different techniques in the same college environment.
