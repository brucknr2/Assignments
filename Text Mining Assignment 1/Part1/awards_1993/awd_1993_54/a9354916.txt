Abstract    :
                Expansion of Ph.D. training within the Department of Biology at  Howard
              University specifically in the area of plant biology is  proposed.  The
              department has a significant group of botany  faculty which reflect a broad
              range of research areas.  This  department (and the University as a whole) has
              made significant  contributions in the area of minority graduate education in 
              science over the years.  Also, Howard University has a rich  history of
              academic excellence and serving as a leader among  minority institutions. 
              Given these considerations, further  development of a consortium network with
              sister undergraduate  institutions is described here: the purpose of this
              arrangement  is to direct talented students toward graduate education and the 
              specific area of plant biology.  This project has the potential  for unmatched
              impact in producing minority plant scientists.
