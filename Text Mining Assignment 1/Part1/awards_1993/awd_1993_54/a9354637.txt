Abstract    :
              9354637  Joesten  The laboratory of introductory college science courses
              provides an  excellent opportunity to improve both the attitudes and scientific
               literacy of liberal arts students and prospective teachers.  This  project is
              developing six ten-minute videodisc programs with  associated HyperCard stacks
              that add a "real-life" component to the  laboratory experience in an
              introductory chemistry course for  nonscience majors.  Since elementary school
              teachers will play a  key role in increasing scientific literacy and in
              changing public  attitudes toward science, the six videodisc programs include 
              elementary classroom scenes where elementary students are doing  exploratory
              activities based on the experiment the college student  has just completed. 
              This provides both prospective teachers and  other liberal arts students an
              opportunity to look for  misconceptions and science content errors.  Students
              view the  appropriate videodisc program at the end of the laboratory period, 
              and their responses to the questions raised in the program are an  integral
              part of the experimental writeup.  After class testing,  the videodisc programs
              with accompanying HyperCard stacks will be  transferred to CD ROM discs to
              allow for individual viewing by  students when they are preparing laboratory
              reports.  The  interactive videodisc and CD ROM programs will provide an
              effective  way to add a component missing from all introductory college 
              chemistry laboratory courses - an immediate illustration of  applying the
              chemical principles of a specific experiment to a  real-life situation.
