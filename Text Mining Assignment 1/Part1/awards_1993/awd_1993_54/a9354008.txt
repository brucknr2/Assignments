Abstract    :
              9354008  Inouye   This workshop on plant reproductive ecology, one of the most 
              dynamic fields in ecology, emphasizes pollination biology. It  will be
              conducted at the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory,  a field station known
              well for its facilities and its research  on this topic. Participants will
              review basic concepts in plant  reproductive biology, learn new laboratory and
              field techniques  for pollination studies, and discuss how these experiences
              can  be incorporated into a variety of undergraduate biology courses  at any
              institution. Participants will conduct individual  research projects and help
              prepare a lab manual.  ***
