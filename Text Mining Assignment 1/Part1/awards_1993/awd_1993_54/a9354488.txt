Abstract    :
              9354488  Hood         A need for hands-on science in elementary schools has been
               identified by a number science education studies and reports.  However,
              implementation of such curricula is often limited by the  lack of appropriate
              science training of elementary school teachers.  Most of the formal science
              education received by an elementary  school teacher comes from traditional
              fact-based university lecture  courses or very structured laboratory courses.
              As teachers tend to  teach the way they were taught, we posit that the key to
              improving  science education nationally is to change the way prospective 
              teachers are taught science. For elementary school teachers to  effectively
              teach a hands-on, inquiry-based curricula, they must  learn science via a
              hands-on inquiry-based approach.  This proposal  seeks to develop a pre-service
              hands-on science course for teachers  in training. The course will be developed
              in collaboration with  colleagues in the college of education and master
              elementary  teachers selected from area schools. We feel such a partnership is 
              essential to design a course which prospective teachers can both  succeed in
              and get excited about. The course will use biological  examples to teach
              content from biology, chemistry and physics but  will convey content via a
              "guided discovery" of heuristic approach.  The course hopes to serve as model
              of science teaching which  students in the course may apply in their future
              classrooms. In  addition, a component of the course is designed to introduce 
              students to a range of hands-on materials for use in teaching  elementary
              school science.
