Abstract    :
              9354762  Grygiel  The field of data communications and computer networks has 
              developed to the point where there are more topics than can be  reasonable
              covered in any one course.  Moreover, there is a strong  emphasis on
              interconnection and interoperability.  This is a  proposal for a computer
              science course in computer networks which:          1.     takes a top down
              approach;         2.     focuses on the performance of upper layers of computer
                             network architecture, on routing, and on routing               
              protocols; and         3.     requires implementation, experimentation, and    
                         mathematical analysis.  Part of the project includes upgrading
              existing software, for the  implementation of and experimentation with a simple
              internet.  It  also includes the development of other software to run
              experiments  on routing protocols.  Interconnection and interoperability is
              gained at layers above the  data-link layer.  A course which requires
              implementation,  experimentation, and mathematical analysis, and which focuses
              on  the performance of those layers will much better prepare computer  science
              students than one which surveys the field of data  communications.
