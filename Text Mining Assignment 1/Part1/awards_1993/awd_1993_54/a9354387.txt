Abstract    :
              9354387  McNeill  A non-science majors course in the biology of aging features a
                curriculum which: 1. develops scientific literacy by integrating  current
              research findings by key investigators in biogerontology;  2. challenges
              students to think for themselves; and 3. includes a  program of open-ended
              field and laboratory exercises that offers  students the opportunity to work
              with older adults and learn about  the heterogeneity of the aging process.  A
              set of educational  materials, including a quarterly newsletter, is being
              developed to  help instructors at other institutions update their curricular 
              materials as well as to provide a means to exchange information on  innovative
              approaches to education in gerontology.
