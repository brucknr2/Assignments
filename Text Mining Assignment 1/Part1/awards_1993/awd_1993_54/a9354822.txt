Abstract    :
              9354822  McDonald    This project improves student awareness of science and
              technology  and increases the retention of freshman students. This goal 
              requires a curriculum development process that creates a pilot  course to
              provide a survey of modern technology. The pilot course  leads to a permanent
              offering in engineering technology that will  serve as an orientation course
              for technology students. The course  also serves as a general education
              elective course to provide  general students, including teacher education
              majors, with a survey  of science in modern technology.  The course uses active
              learning experiences as an orientation  process to foster student success in
              technical careers. These  learning experiences use motivational laboratory
              exercises to  explore modern technology while improving the students' problem 
              solving, communication, and study skills. These laboratory  exercises present
              modern technology in automated manufacturing and  robotics, computer-aided
              design and manufacturing, and electronics  and computer technology.  Women,
              Native American Indian, and undecided students are  encouraged to enroll in the
              survey course. This course increases  their technical literacy and encourage
              their pursuit of engineering  and science related careers.
