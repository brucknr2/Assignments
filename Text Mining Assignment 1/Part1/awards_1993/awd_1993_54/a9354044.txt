Abstract    :
                Pre-service teacher preparation activities are developed by a  team of faculty
              members at the University of Tulsa and Tulsa  Junior College. These activities
              focus on three principal areas:  preparation of parateachers; implementation
              and planning for  summer academies designed to recruit and improve the
              preparation  of future teachers; and an evaluation of the science and 
              mathematics curriculum needs for teacher preparation in the State  of Oklahoma.
              A curriculum for elementary level parateachers is  developed, implemented, and
              evaluated, and a formulation of a  curriculum for secondary school parateachers
              is completed. A high  school summer academy is implemented and detailed
              planning  activities for elementary and middle school summer academies is 
              conducted. The evaluation of mathematics and science curriculum  needs is done
              to identify common goals and foster closer  cooperation among institutions
              providing pre-service teacher  preparation in Oklahoma.
