Abstract    :
              9354124  Hall    St. Mary's University will use the MIE planning grant to form 
              collaborative teams of educators representing undergraduate and  graduate
              higher education institutions and leaders in industry to  assess current
              strengths and weaknesses of the SEM disciplines at  St. Mary's and then develop
              a comprehensive proposal for Phase II  Implementation designed to address the
              MIE program goals. These  goals are to increase the number of minority students
              who will be  prepared to enter SEM fields, excel in their studies, and pursue 
              advanced SEM degrees. The planning process will consist of  activities designed
              to: 1) assess the quality and effectiveness  of selected SEM disciplines at St.
              Mary's by recognized leaders  in academia and industry; 2) analyze existing
              models of  excellence in targeted SEM disciplines at collaborating 
              universities in order to transfer appropriate elements of those  programs to
              St. Mary's; 3) establish a plan-or-action to link St.  Mary's SEM graduates to
              participating universities with  outstanding graduate degree programs; and 4)
              to develop and write  a comprehensive proposal for Phase II Implementation of
              the MIE  program.
