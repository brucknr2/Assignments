Abstract    :
              9354031  Bayliss  Three science/mathematics faculty from San Jose State College 
              are designing and presenting a team taught capstone course  emphasizing the
              integration of the natural and physical  sciences with mathematics for senior
              preservice science and  mathematics majors.  The course will present several of
              the  themes in the Science Framework for California Public Schools  in an
              integrated mathematics/science format.  Related faculty  development workshops
              are presented at San Francisco State  University.  The initial workshop, for
              all science and  mathematics faculty, explores new methods of teaching and 
              learning.  A second workshop, for Biology Department faculty,  raises the level
              of awareness on how faculty learn and how, as  science and mathematics
              teachers, faculty can serve as role  models for preservice teachers for
              excellence in teaching.  The  focus is, in part, on learning from the
              constructivist  perspective.  ***
