Abstract    :
              9354539  Henderson  The recruitment and retention of under-represented students 
              continues to be one of the primary challenges for higher education.  In the
              field of engineering, women are one of the most  under-represented groups, and
              women continue to have higher  attrition rates from engineering than their male
              peers. We have  identified a number of factors which contribute to the
              differential  attrition rates between men and women in engineering and have 
              developed, with preliminary funding from NSF, a novel,  collaborative
              laboratory course to explore "how things work". The  course, known as
              Engineering 25, provides freshman and sophomore  women engineering students
              with the opportunity to disassemble  equipment and construct devices to
              discover the underlying  engineering principles involved. The course is unique
              in that it  has, so far, been limited to women engineering students, uses 
              open-ended hands-on projects to stimulate scientific curiosity and  alleviate
              mechanical anxieties, it is based on a collaborative,  group exploration
              approach to learning, and it allows students to  explore issues of gender in
              science and engineering. In the  proposed project, we will further develop the
              course by offering  two sections of E25 which will be team-taught by the P.l.s,
              assess  the importance of the various course components (gender make-up, 
              tinkering, collaborative nature, and women's issues), and determine  the best
              way to institutionalize the course.  ***y
