Abstract    :
              9354040  Fasching  Three institutions within the state of Rhode Island (the 
              University of Rhode Island, Rhode Island College and the  Community College of
              Rhode Island) are designing faculty  workshops to change the teaching approach
              of the mathematics,  science, technology, and education faculty at their 
              institutions.  The workshops are a base for the development of  college
              statewide frameworks for the teaching of mathematics  and the sciences.  The
              team is also developing an  implementation plan for a mentor-mentoring chain
              concept that  will span from grade three through college.  ***
