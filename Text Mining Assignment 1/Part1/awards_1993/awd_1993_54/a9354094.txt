Abstract    :
              9354094  Skidmore    The continuing Committee on Women is Science and
              Engineering  (CWSE), within the Office of Scientific and Engineering Personnel 
              of the National Research Council, is comprised of expert scientists  and
              engineers who are particularly knowledgeable about the  underparticipation of
              women in the technological work force of the  United States.  This project
              helps to fund activities of the  Committee to achieve greater representation of
              women in science and  engineering (S&E) at undergraduate, graduate,
              postdoctoral, and  professional levels in the United States.  CSWE is
              continuing and  expanding the multifaceted program of activities developed
              during  the past three years to address the unerrepresentation of women in  S&E
              careers.     While recognition of the barriers to participation in science and 
              engineering by women, and of the need for more comprehensive  measures to spur
              the development of female scientists and  engineers, have been evident for some
              time, parity representation  of female scientists and engineers has not been
              achieved.  CWSE is  helping to address this problem by:  serving as a resource
              to  collect and disseminate data on the needs of and opportunities for  women
              in science and engineering; exerting its influence on the S&E  community, and
              society as a whole, working toward the removal of  barriers to the
              participation of women in the sciences and  engineering; encouraging
              interactions between concerned groups; and  stimulating development of
              innovative programs to increase the  representation of women in scientific and
              engineering careers.  The  Committee is setting an example in the S&E
              community, playing an  effective role in revealing the status of and the
              opportunities for  women in these areas in society, as well as making
              recommendations  for policy and program changes that will enhance the
              participation  of women in S&E careers.  ***
