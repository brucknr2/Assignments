Abstract    :
                Throughout the United States, non-point sources of water pollution  are
              responsible for contamination of more miles of stream than any  other source,
              and also contribute substantially to groundwater  degradation.  Non-point
              sources of water pollution include  municipalities, industries, agriculture,
              mine drainage, energy  production and recreation.    This training program,
              which is supported by a strong and  successful interdisciplinary research team,
              combines water quantity  and water quality analysis with control and
              remediation of non-  point source water pollution.  Emphasis will be on
              expanding basic  scientific knowledge with applications to identification and 
              quantification of non-point sources of water pollution and  selection of the
              most suitable alternative for mitigation of a  particular problem.  There is
              capacity for the program, which is   expected to expand.    Innovative
              structural components in the training program include:         1.  A consortial
              arrangement between Colorado State University            and the University of
              Wyoming (EPSCoR University).         2.  An interdisciplinary effort between
              Watershed Sciences,            Civil Engineering, Range Science, and Agronomy
              (water            chemistry).         3.  An active recruiting program for
              women, minorities            including Native Americans, and those with
              disabilities.         4.  Implementation of a "project management" approach to 
                        improve communications among participants and improve           
              trainee retention.
