Abstract    :
              Two major challenges facing the U.S. construction industry today are (1) the
              lack of women  educators and practitioners in the field of construction
              engineering and management and (2) the  decline of productivity in the
              construction industry.    The proposed research program will address the first
              concern by (1) proactive recruitment of  women engineering students (at the
              graduate, undergraduate, and high school levels) to pursue  education,
              research, and careers in construction; (2) mentoring of Graduate Research
              Trainees  by faculty members, industry professionals, and advanced graduate
              students; and (3) providing  training to Graduate Research Trainees on
              research, teaching, technical writing and presentation  skills.    The second
              concern will be addressed by guiding the Graduate Research Trainees to expand 
              upon the ongoing research in construction automation and robotics at the
              University.  This  research will result in the development of a Computer-Aided
              Design/Construction (CAD/CAC)  System capable of:  (1) evaluating CAD models
              from the perspective of constructability; (2)  selecting suitable automated
              construction equipment for a project; (3) generating efficient process  plans
              for operation of the automated equipment; and (4) generating equipment-level
              control  instructions.    This interdisciplinary research will facilitate the
              implementation of flexible automation  technologies in the U.S. construction
              industry and will thereby improve its competitiveness in  the global
              marketplace.
