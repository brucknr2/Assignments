Abstract    :
              Garfunkel  9354099    Gateways II is a conference to be held in Boston, MA on  
              October 1-3, 1993 to bring together the curriculum developers  from all of the
              NSF-funded elementary, middle, and secondary  school comprehensive mathematics
              curriculum projects. They share  information, experiences and address common
              questions which have  arisen as materials and curricula have been produced.  In
               addition, questions of evaluation, teacher enhancement and  implementation are
              addressed.  The interaction of the developers  of these projects is to provide
              better materials more  expeditiously which can be implemented is schools.  ***
