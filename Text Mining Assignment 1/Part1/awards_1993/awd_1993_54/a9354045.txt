              science and mathematics faculty from SUNY Cortland, four  faculty from related
              community colleges and two master teachers  are being conducted to produce
              course outlines for a series of  related courses in mathematics, pedagogy,
              science and field  experiences for K-6 pre-service teachers.  All the seminars
              are  focused on changes in curriculum and course structure which  follow upon
              the "Conceptual Change" approach to teaching and  learning.  ***
