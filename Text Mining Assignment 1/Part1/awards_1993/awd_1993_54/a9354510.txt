Abstract    :
              9354510  Billington  This proposal seeks to provide a textbook and teaching
              materials  for an introductory-level engineering course of an 
              interdisciplinary nature that seeks to attract students into  engineering, and
              to educate non-engineering students in  engineering. This new course is aimed
              at freshmen engineering  students, at students interested in pre-college
              teaching careers,  goals and open to all students in college. The course
              describes the  200-year transformation of American society through the
              innovations  of large-scale structures, powerful machines, continental networks
               of communication and power, and industrial processes all  culminating in the
              complex world of the late twentieth century. The  course also introduces
              students to techniques for more effective  communication by written, oral, and
              visual means.  This proposal is  to develop a set of teaching units, to test
              them at several  institutions, and to complete a textbook. The materials will 
              introduce students to the scientific bases for engineering, the  social context
              within which modern engineering arises, and the  intimate relationship between
              engineering and modern culture.  Efforts will also be made to make engineering
              more accessible to  women and underrepresented minorities.
