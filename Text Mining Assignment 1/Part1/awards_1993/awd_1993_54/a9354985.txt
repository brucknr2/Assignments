Abstract    :
              9354985  Sowder    Five graduate research traineeships are being requested for
              the new  doctoral program being offered jointly by San Diego State  University
              and University of California, San Diego.  The goals of  the program are to
              educate individuals who will be well-versed both  in a subject area
              (mathematics, physics, chemistry, or biology) and  in the cognitive issues
              related to learning that subject; who will  maintain a strong connection to
              educational practice through  teaching and applying research to instruction and
              assessment and  who will influence the educational process through their 
              contributions as researchers, educators, administrators, and  developers of
              formal and informal educational materials.  This  program results from a
              partnership between interdisciplinary  faculty groups at the two universities. 
              Each partner brings  distinct and complementary contributions to the program. 
              Together,  these two faculties provide a unique approach to the fields of 
              mathematics and science education, an approach that is  simultaneously based on
              the changing natures of mathematics and  science and their place in
              undergraduate education and on the  learning and teaching of basic science and
              mathematics concepts.   The traineeships will allow an additional five
              applicants to be  admitted to the program.  Special efforts will be made to
              recruit  from underrepresented groups.  ***
