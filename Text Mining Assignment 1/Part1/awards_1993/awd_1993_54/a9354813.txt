Abstract    :
              9354813  Jungck           This project will enable post-secondary biology
              faculty to examine,  critique, and change their biology curricula by providing
              the  philosophy, tools, resources, support, and sharing network  essential to
              such a process.  This is being accomplished through a  variety of mechanisms
              including the publication of a book and the  hosting of three learning tools
              development workshops.  The book  will be a multi-authored, collaborative work
              on the BioQUEST 3P's  philosophy with specific examples of use of materials in
              the  BioQUEST Library, use of the 3P's in wet labs and field work and in 
              situations where computers are not necessary, and discussions of  the specific
              issues related to the development and implementation  of open-ended, research
              and research-like experiences for students.   The project will also support
              curricular reform and learning tools  development through three summer
              workshops in three additional  major areas of biology.  Materials and
              information dissemination  will occur using a variety of methods including the
              book, BioQUEST  Notes, the BioQUESTLibrary, presentations and workshops at 
              conferences, the Introducing BioQUEST Hypercard stacks, field  testing of
              materials as part of the three-stage review process for  publication in the
              BioQUESTLibrary, through other publications such  as journal articles and labs
              in labbooks, electronic networks, the  monthly consortium status reports, and
              responses to general  inquiries via phone, e-mail, and U.S. mail.
