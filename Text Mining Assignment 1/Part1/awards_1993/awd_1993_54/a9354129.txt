Abstract    :
              9354129  Barba    City College will undertake a planning process involving a 
              comprehensive assessment of its institutional needs in science  and engineering
              education and the needs of the minority students  enrolled as majors in these
              programs of study. The results of  this assessment, along with the examination
              of exemplary programs  at other institutions, will lead to the development of a
              broad-  based, long-term plan to guide the College as it builds its  capability
              to recruit, educate and graduate significantly more  minority students in
              science and engineering fields.    Important partners in the planning process
              will be  representatives from business and industry, professional 
              organizations, community colleges and the New York City public  schools.
              Although the experiences and needs of all minority  students will be considered
              in the planning process, particular  attention will be focused on Hispanic
              students.
