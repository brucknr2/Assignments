Abstract    :
              9354087  Owen  This proposal will establish a Natural Science Foundation 
              Courseware Repository at Georgia State University.  This  repository will
              collect, organize and store the courseware  materials electronically and make
              them available to educators.   The materials it collects will include items
              developed under  NSF funded workshops and curriculum development projects as 
              well as other solicited items.  All materials will be referred  before being
              accepted into the repository.  ***
