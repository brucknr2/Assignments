Abstract    :
              9354055  Granger  Program Development Project for the Enhancement of Teacher 
              Preparation  The St. Louis Regional Enhancement Collaborative for  Excellence
              in Preparation of Teachers (RECEPT) is designing a  comprehensive regional
              effort to redesign, develop and  partially test the mathematics and science
              component of the  K-8 teacher preparation program in the St Louis region.  
              Institutions participating include one state university, the  University of
              Missouri-St Louis (the fiscal agent), one state  college, Harris-Stowe State
              College, two small private  colleges, Fontbonne College and St. Louis
              University, and  three school districts within the St Louis area, Rockwood, 
              St. Louis and University City.  Together these institutions  account for over
              95% (480 of 500 total) of the elementary  certificates awarded in St Louis in
              1991/92.  The redesigned  teacher preparation program includes a three semester
               integrated science class with tightly coupled methods  courses, a two semester
              sequence of mathematics with  integrated methods courses and a one semester
              capstone course  that integrates mathematics and science concepts around a 
              science, technology and society theme.  Field experience is  integrated with
              the courses.  The redesign team features  close cooperation between mathematics
              and science faculty,  mathematics and science educators, and cooperating master
               teachers.  The redesigned courses strongly reflect the  guidelines established
              by the NCTM for mathematics and the  NSTA for the sciences.  ***y
