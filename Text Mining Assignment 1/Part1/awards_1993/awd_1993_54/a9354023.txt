Abstract    :
              9354023  Uno  This project intends to help prepare new instructors to teach 
              undergraduate biology courses at junior colleges, community  colleges, or
              four-year colleges.  Because graduates of research  institutions usually
              receive little training in biology  education or experience in developing their
              own course,  first-year faculty members often face a task for which they are 
              poorly trained.  This proposal outlines a two-year project  including: (a) four
              workshops presented at annual meetings of  professional biologists; and (b) the
              production, review, and  distribution of a handbook (based on the workshops)
              for  inexperienced instructors on developing and teaching  undergraduate
              biology courses.  The workshops will be led by  faculty experienced in: (a)
              teaching biology using inquiry  (Gordon Uno, Univ of Oklahoma); (b) assessment,
              critical  thinking skills, and cooperative learning (Leona Truchan,  Alverno
              College); and (c) open-ended biological computer  simulations (John Jungck,
              BioQUEST and Beloit College).  Workshops will: (a) introduce participants to
              contemporary  pedagogical strategies and concerns; (b) have participants 
              develop a syllabus for their biology course(s); and (c)  determine the content
              of the proposed handbook. The handbook  also will be based on questionnaires
              and selected parts of  Developing Biological Literacy, a biology curriculum
              framework  developed by the Biological Sciences Curriculum Study (BSCS).   The
              handbook will be distributed at annual meetings of a  variety of professional
              biological organizations.  ***
