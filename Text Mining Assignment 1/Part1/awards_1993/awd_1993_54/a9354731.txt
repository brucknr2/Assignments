Abstract    :
              9354731  Thiel                                                  Molecular
              biology and biochemistry are the basis for  biotechnology which is radically
              changing medicine, forensics,  pharmaceuticals, agriculture, and agricultural
              products. This  project, therefore, systematically integrates biotechnology 
              into the undergraduate biology curriculum; and will educate all  biology
              students, including future biology and science  teachers, in the concepts and
              techniques of biotechnology.  Implementation will require major revision of a
              two-semester  introductory biology course, as well as undergraduate genetics 
              and biochemistry. Key concepts are introduced early in the  curriculum, are
              reinforced and expanded slowly as the student  advances, and are taught in
              different contexts relevant to a  specific discipline. Students also work in
              teams, share  information and cooperate in solving problems. It is also 
              expected that this type of integrated program will be useful to  others, in
              particular departments and institutions that plan to  offer a technologically
              relevant education.
