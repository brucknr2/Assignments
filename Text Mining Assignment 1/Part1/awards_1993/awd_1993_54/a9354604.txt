Abstract    :
              9354604  Sawyer    A number of issues associated with high attrition in the
              classroom,  especially virtual reliance on learning through the 
              lecture/discussion teaching approach, will be the focus for this  project.
              Also, the primary goal is to improve the academic success  rate among "at-risk
              students". Learning strategies are being  developed with emphasis on improving
              scientific literacy,  especially critical thinking and problem solving.
