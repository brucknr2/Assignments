Abstract    :
              9354530  Hughes  The project will make use of a large aquarium as an aquatic 
              ecosystem on which to develop concepts and techniques of analytical  chemistry.
               Chemical monitoring of all aspects of the ecosystem  will be the basis for a
              part of the laboratory experience.  The  curriculum, already introduced at the
              introductory level, now will  be expanded to the third quarter freshman level
              chemistry class.  This class includes prospective chemistry, engineering,
              textile,  and biology majors. The course modifications will introduce  relevant
              problems from the real world into the laboratory  curriculum, stimulate
              increased interest in chemistry, and possibly  increase the number of chemistry
              majors at this level. The affect  on the junior/senior analytical curriculum
              will be to significantly  increase the amount of time available for training
              and independent  work on modern instrumentation.  The proposed course
              modifications  will provide a greater appreciation for the field of chemistry
              and  the role it plays in the environment and all biological processes.  ***y
