Abstract    :
              9354742  Pifer  One of the most critical shortfalls nationwide in science 
              education today is our failure to impart scientific literacy to  the
              non-science student.  Watered-down survey courses may teach  some basic
              scientific facts and jargon, but they rarely give  students the critical skills
              necessary to function effectively  in a technological society.  We propose to
              develop an  interdisciplinary course that studies a complex, multifaceted 
              problem, the Greenhouse Effect, from many points of view--  scientific,
              economic, political--as a way of building  scientific literacy in these
              students.  The course will treat  the scientific background of the Greenhouse
              Effect, its impact  on the earth and human society, and ways to minimize the
              impact  with an emphasis on alternative energy sources including a  detailed
              case study of nuclear energy.  Formal lectures will be  avoided.  Students will
              be given short lecture presentations,  but for the most part will be engaged in
              discourse among  themselves in which they will ask questions of the instructors
               and with faculty experts on the meaning and implications of the  presentations
              and of readings.  A series of laboratory  exercises is designed to illustrate
              the physical principles  involved in the Greenhouse Effect.  The course will
              culminate  with written reports and oral group presentations on case  studies
              carried out by the groups on non-nuclear alternative  fuels from a
              scientifically informed point of view.
