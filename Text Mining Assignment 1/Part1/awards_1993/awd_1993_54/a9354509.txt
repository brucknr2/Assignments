Abstract    :
              9354509  Meyer  A two-semester introduction to the principles and practice of 
              mathematics is being developed for students who wish to study  a significant
              amount of mathematics, including majors and  minors in mathematics, computer
              science, and many science and  engineering disciplines. This course is designed
              as an  alternate (to the standard calculus sequence) route into the 
              mathematics curriculum, one which stresses breadth and includes  much of the
              modern mathematics and applications which are  currently "homeless" in the
              mathematics curricula. The design,  review, field test, and production of the
              course is being  overseen by an advisory/editorial board and author team with a
               wide range of mathematical expertise and writing experience.   There is an
              extensive outreach effort including regular  mailings, professional meetings
              presentations, and faculty  enhancement workshops. The project will culminate
              with the  dissemination of the materials by a major textbook publisher.
