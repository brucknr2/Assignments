Abstract    :
              9354042  Wyckoff  A project-oriented, curriculum-integrated laboratory science 
              course, Patterns in Nature (3 credit hours), tailored for  elementary education
              majors and in-service teachers, is being  developed at Arizona State University
              in collaboration with Navajo  Community College.  The course integrates the
              disciplines of  mathematics, chemistry, astronomy, physics, and engineering.  A
               focus of the course is on inquiry based pedagogy utilizing research 
              instruments (e.g., electron microscopes, scanning tunneling  microscopes,
              telescopes equipped with charge-coupled devices),  state-of-the-art computer
              simulations, and interactive pedagogical  software.  Different versions of the
              course are being developed in  parallel and in collaboration at ASU and NCC. 
              The objective is to  develop a course in physical science intended as a sequel
              to the  normal basic science courses required for elementary school  teachers,
              so that the teachers will have an in-depth knowledge of  the physical laws they
              teach and the science modules and kits used  in the Arizona and Navajo school
              systems.  The courses are suitable  as general studies undergraduate courses at
              both institutions.  The  aim is to improve the science and mathematics
              curricula offered to  elementary pre-service teachers in the Phoenix area and
              the Navajo  Nation.  Course contents are cross-disciplinary and cross-cultural,
               and taught in student-centered, laboratory-integrated, Socratic  dialogue,
              critical inquiry environments equipped with state-of-the-  art software and
              hardware.  Nationally recognized science educators  in biology, chemistry,
              engineering, and physics will collaborate in  the curriculum development.  ***y
