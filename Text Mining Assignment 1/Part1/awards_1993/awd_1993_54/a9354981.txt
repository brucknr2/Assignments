Abstract    :
                   Increased utilization of natural gas in place of petroleum-  based products
              would benefit the environment as well as the  National economy.  However,
              technological hurdles currently prevent  much greater use of natural gas in
              several key applications.  The  School of Chemical Engineering and Materials
              Sciences (CEMS) at the  University of Oklahoma is the lead department in a 
              multidisciplinary, multi-institutional center being formed to  develop
              environmentally friendly natural gas technologies.   Research goals include
              technologies for methane conversion to  higher value chemicals, high density
              natural gas storage at  moderate temperature and pressure, technologies for
              natural gas  vehicles' emissions control, and improved natural gas fuel cells. 
                     The five Graduate Research Traineeships will help build the  foundation
              of the new center and contribute to its mission.  The  traineeships will be
              awarded in Fall, 1994 to five graduate  students entering CEMS.  Trainees will
              be involved in collaborative  research with colleagues in industry, in other
              disciplines, and at  other universities.  Trainees also will have the
              opportunity to  serve as mentors for undergraduate researchers, a program
              designed  to enhance the research experience of the trainee and influence the 
              undergraduate to consider graduate chemical engineering study.
