Abstract    :
              9354104  Sowder    This is a four-year project at $751,309 at San Diego State 
              University to produce mathematics content course modules for use in  teacher
              preparation and teacher enhancement for elementary and  middle school teachers
              of mathematics.  The project will develop  modules, including the use of CD-ROM
              technology, that focus on  providing a deep understanding of the mathematics
              the participants  ar expected to teach.  Modules address: number sense with
              whole and  rational numbers, proportional reasoning, measuring, spatial sense 
              and geometry, exploring data, chance, patterns and functions, and  mathematical
              change.  The materials will be developed to provide  course instructors the
              opportunity to model the types of  instructional delivery expected of teachers
              in grades K-8, both in  their classroom and through the inclusion of video of
              student  interviews and classroom episodes from grade K-8 situations.  The 
              project will be done in southern California, and modules will be  available
              nationwide upon completion.  the modules will be in  software and CD-ROM format
              allowing instructor capability to modify  to special needs.  Cost sharing by
              SDSU, school districts, and  other local projects is approximately 25% of the
              total project  cost.
