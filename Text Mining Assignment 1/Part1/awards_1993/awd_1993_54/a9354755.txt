Abstract    :
              9354755  Wrigley  This project will restructure the general microbiology course 
              to  an investigative format in which students use hypotheses as a  springboard
              for further, more specialized study. To accomplish this  task the course will
              be constructed around topic modules that  incorporate investigative laboratory
              activities. Also, students  will be taught to design and perform simple
              experiments to support  or disprove a given hypothesis and to form hypotheses
              from their  own observations.  Over the course of the project, faculty will 
              expand piloted materials  and further restructure the existing  course, using
              small group techniques, investigative experiments,  hypothesis generation and
              testing, interactive tutorials, and daily  laboratory sessions. It is expected
              that this project will be a  more effective learning experience for all general
              microbiology  students; a more relevant focus for undergraduates in programs
              such  as nursing, environmental biology, and microbiology; and a  significant
              pedagogical model for science education majors.  ***y
