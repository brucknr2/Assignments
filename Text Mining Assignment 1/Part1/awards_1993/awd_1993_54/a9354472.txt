Abstract    :
              9354472  Jones  We will create computer lessons, containing video clips,
              focusing  on the lecture-demonstration experiments in an introductory Physics 
              course sequence. These algebra-based courses are taken by pre-med  and some
              other pre-professional students, as well as by some  non-science students
              fulfilling a science requirement. Because the  computer experiments can be
              repeated on demand, students will build  up their experience with the phenomena
              under study; this will help  provide a reference base within which fundamental
              concepts are  framed. A series of carefully crafted questions within the
              lessons  will lead students to critically analyze the situations, and to 
              thereby strengthen their conceptual understanding. In addition,  because the
              computer lessons will greatly increase student  interaction with the important
              principles exemplified by these  experiments, they will lay the groundwork for
              more detailed problem  solving.
