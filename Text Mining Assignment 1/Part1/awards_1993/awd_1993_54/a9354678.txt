Abstract    :
              9354678  Cook  Students first learn statistical thinking through simple 
              graphics like bar charts and histograms.  At the college level  a graphical
              approach to statistics is less often used.  This is  so in part because good
              graphics have only just become  available on computers.  Possibly a more
              important reason is  that while numerical methods have a firm mathematical
              footing,  graphical statistics have consisted primarily of methods of 
              graphing, without any accompanying theory.  In this project, a theoretically
              sound graphical approach to  statistics is being developed.  Lessons
              concentrate on  regression modelling or curve fitting as well as other 
              statistical ideas which can be used in courses at all levels.   What
              differentiates this project from others on graphics is the  development of a
              unified theory to make graphs more  comprehensible and much more useful in the
              analysis phase of a  study.
