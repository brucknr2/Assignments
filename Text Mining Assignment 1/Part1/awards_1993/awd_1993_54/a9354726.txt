Abstract    :
              9354726  Henning  The specific objectives of this proposal are to develop and
              host a  summer Undergraduate Workshop in Micro-machining Science and 
              Fabrication Technology, and to develop an undergraduate course  entitled
              Science and Technology of Micro-machines covering the same  material.  These
              two activities will be developed jointly.  The  Workshop is targeted for
              minority undergraduate majors in science  and engineering.  Its purpose is to
              prepare students to enter  graduate degree programs, and to gain employment by
              companies  engaged in the rapidly evolving field of micro-machine engineering, 
              science, and technology.  It is particularly intended to prepare  students to
              make leading, lifelong contributions to this field.  Networking with guest
              lectures and visitor drawn from industry and  academe will be an important
              component of the Workshop and course.  The major benefit of the summer Workshop
              is to increase the number  of minority students entering science and
              engineering.  The  Workshop will further serve as the foundation for a new 
              undergraduate major course in Engineering Science at Dartmouth  College,
              entitled "Science and Technology of Micro-Machines."   Benefits will be to
              promote evolution and growth in the field of  micro-machines by:  preparing
              skilled undergraduates to make  contributions at the graduate level, and with
              industrial firms  engaged in this field; providing an important bridge between 
              undergraduates, and leaders in the field; and disseminating results  of this
              effort to the academic community, to lead in and assist the  replication of
              similar undergraduate programs at other  institutions.  ***y
