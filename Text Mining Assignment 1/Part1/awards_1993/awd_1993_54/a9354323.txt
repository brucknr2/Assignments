Abstract    :
              9354323  Yoder              This project is preparing a hypertext "electronic"
              textbook that  requires the active involvement of the student in the discussion
              of  principles as well as the application of these principles in the  solution
              of problems.  Given that active, rather than passive,  study is necessary for
              the mastery and application of the concepts  of chemistry, the computer
              provides an ideal vehicle for this type  of learning, especially in the form of
              hypertext.  Our preliminary  version of a hypertext problem solving guide using
              the hypertext  program Guide (OWL International) has received very favorable 
              student responses.  We believe that this hypertext program, using  the Guide
              software, is helping to develop rational approaches to  learning and
              problem-solving, is building self confidence, is  making the concepts of
              chemistry accessible to students with a  greater range of abilities, and is
              serving as a model for the  teaching of chemistry by secondary school teachers.
               This hypertext  book, ChemGuide, is encouraging student participation by 
              constructing most discussions around questions that must be  answered by the
              student.  The responses to the questions are hidden  in hypertext until
              selected by the student. ChemGuide also provides  hints and definitions upon
              selection and when necessary takes the  student to an appropriate section of
              the text for review or help.   Although the content of ChemGuide is adapted
              from an introductory  text co-authored by the principal investigator, the
              conceptual  content of the ChemGuide is similar to that of most texts.  ***y
