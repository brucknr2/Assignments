Abstract    :
              9354461  Meloan  The project will continue an effort to develop a comprehensive
              six  semester curriculum in chemistry.  Much of the effort will be  directed at
              organic chemistry concepts.  The laboratory oriented  approach will be
              individualized so that students from different  majors and interests can learn
              chemistry within a context that  excites and interests them.  This will include
              experiments on food  chemistry, tanning, soil chemistry, etc.  All students
              will be  exposed to standard techniques through videos and other approaches.  
              The experiments are all multipart and extend over several  laboratory sessions.
               They focus on real world situations which has  proven to be exciting to the
              students.  ***y
