Abstract    :
              9354628  Benford  This pilot project develops a module for use in general
              biology for  majors courses.  The neuroscience based module-Mind, Brain, 
              Behavior-includes hands-on and readings-based activities on such  topics as The
              Jogger's High, Modification of Brine Shrimp Behavior,  Mapping the Brain,
              Neurotransmitters and Disorders, Drugs and Brain  Synapses, Ethics of Using
              Tissues from Aborted Fetuses,  Legalization of Psychotropic Drugs.  In the
              hands-on activities,  students collect, graph and analyze data; propose further
               hypotheses; and search the literature.  The scientific approach to  solving
              questions is emphasized.  Readings based activities focus  on developing skill
              in critical reading.  Working individually and  as teams, students identify
              hypotheses, analyze supporting  evidence, convert words into visual images and
              models, propose  alternate hypotheses/conclusions, and debate ethical, economic
              or  political implications.  The module is self-standing and includes  an
              Instructor's Manual, a Student Study Guide, a Readings Set, and  examinations
              to assess existing knowledge and misconceptions in  pre-test/post-test format.
