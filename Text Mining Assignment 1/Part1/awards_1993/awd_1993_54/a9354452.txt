Abstract    :
              9354452  Meinwald  There is a need to increase the scientific literacy of
              college  students in the USA. This proposal involves the development of a  new
              introductory course, The Language of Chemistry, intended  primarily for
              students who are not committed to a major in  chemistry. The immediate
              challenge is to provide an attractive  course which students from areas such as
              the social sciences and  the humanities will elect to help fulfill a
              "distribution"  requirement. The proposed course will illustrate how chemists
              study  problems involving chemical interactions in nature. Among the cases 
              likely to be included for study are (1) the chemistry of gamete  attractants;
              (2) the female pheromone of the silkworm moth; (3)  quinine, antimalarials, and
              synthetic dyes; (4) penicillin; and (5)  taxol.  Basic concepts in general
              chemistry and organic chemistry  will be developed as they are required for the
              understanding of  this set of particularly interesting problems at the
              interface  between chemistry and biology or medicine. The methods of analyzing 
              problems will be emphasized, rather than the memorization of  specific results
              or formulas. Students should gain an understanding  of subjects as diverse as:
              chromatography and other purification  techniques, spectroscopy, molecular
              formulas, molecular structures  (and how chemical and physical methods
              establish them),  stereochemistry, atomic structure, the periodic table,
              chemical  bonding, functional groups, Avogadro's number, and why synthesis is 
              important. There will be an opportunity for students, working in  small groups,
              to prepare and present short reports on chemical  topics, based on library
              research.  The project will work with  colleagues in the science education
              department on course  development and evaluation.  Course related materials
              will also be  generated.  ***y
