Abstract    :
              9354776  Fisher         This proposal articulates the development of a new
              undergraduate  mathematics education program consisting of three new courses
              for  undergraduate preservice secondary mathematics teachers and two new 
              courses in developmental entry level mathematics based on proven  secondary
              reform curriculum. The developmental courses are  adaptations of the highly
              acclaimed reform secondary mathematics  curriculum, the Interactive Mathematics
              Project (IMP). The  preservice courses provide training in the philosophies,
              attitudes,  objectives, and methods underlying the new reform curriculum and 
              include specific training in the delivery of the adapted IMP  materials. The
              preservice teachers participate in a highly  structured field experience based
              on reform ideas as they actually  teach (under the supervision of mathematics
              education faculty), the  two new developmental courses to college students with
              entry level  mathematics deficiencies.  The project is conducted in two
              distinct settings: CSU, Chico (a  typical four year institution that has
              remedial students and a  teacher preparation program) and in a collaborative
              setting between  the University of California, Irvine (a research institution
              with  preservice teachers) and Irvine Valley College (a community college  that
              has a large population of remedial students). Development of  the curriculum,
              materials, and implementation design allows easy  export to either higher
              educational setting throughout the nation.  This innovative
              preservice-developmental proposal provides both an  important advancement in
              aligning secondary mathematics teacher  preparation programs with reform ideas
              and an economical solution  to the growing bottleneck of students with entry
              level mathematics  problems.  ***y
