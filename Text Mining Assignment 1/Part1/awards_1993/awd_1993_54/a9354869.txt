Abstract    :
              9354869  Carberry    We propose a training program that will produce five new
              PhD's in  the targeted area of Computer Science:  Human-computer interface, 
              with an emphasis on the development of an intelligent natural  language
              communication system.  Our proposed program will involve  1) cross-disciplinary
              study among computer science, linguistics,  and psychology, 2) industrial
              internships to introduce students to  technology transfer and provide them with
              application-oriented  experience, 3) international research opportunities that
              will  expose the trainees to international researchers and to the  technology
              being developed through European Esprit projects, 4)  classroom teaching
              experience to prepare the trainees for educating  future researchers, 5)
              cost-sharing by the Department of Computer  Science at the University of
              Delaware and industrial organizations,  and 6) an aggressive recruiting effort
              and a detailed retention  plan.  ***
