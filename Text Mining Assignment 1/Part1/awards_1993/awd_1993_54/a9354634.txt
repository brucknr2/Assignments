Abstract    :
              9354634  Escoe  This project focuses on an appropriate design for
              large-enrollment  introductory micro- and macro-economic courses. The project
              also  applies concepts and theories that are relevant to undergraduate  student
              roles in the economy and society.    Thematic introductory curricula are being
              developed to be more  relevant to a diverse student body. Modules for each
              thematic  curriculum contain approaches and materials designed to encourage 
              "active learning". The impact of the curricula and learning  techniques on
              student enrollment, performance, and retention will  be analyzed, and it is
              expected that the thematic curricula and  teaching techniques will better meet
              the needs of the target  audience at the institution.  In addition, general and
              specific  materials resulting from the project will be disseminated through  a
              series of handbooks, articles, conferences, and seminars to other  faculty and
              scholars.  ***y
