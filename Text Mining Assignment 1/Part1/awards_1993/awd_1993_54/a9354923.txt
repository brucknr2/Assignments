Abstract    :
              9354923  Entekhabi    The traineeship program in the hydrologic sciences is an 
              interdisciplinary reseach and education initiative between the  Environmental
              Engineering and Water Resources division of the MIT  Departments of Civil and
              Environmental Engineering (C&EE) and the  Center for Meteorology and Physical
              Oceanography (CMPO) in the MIT  Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary
              Sciences.  These two  Departments currently have strong links, in terms of both
               educational and research programs, through the MIT Center for  Global Change
              Science.    The proposed traineeship program is focused on educating earth 
              scientists in the observation, analysis and modeling of physical  processes
              governing the hydrologic cycle and the climate  system.   Investigations on the
              role of clouds, vegetation, land-surface  processes and atmospheric transport
              mechanisms are key to the  international, national and Institute-wide
              initiatives on the  scientific analysis of Global change and the definition of 
              sustainable development.    The MIT proposal is strongly focused on training
              and education at  both undergraduate and graduate levels.  The proposed MIT
              training  program in the hydrologic sciences will include: l) 
              multidisciplinary graduate education, 2) experience with integrated 
              analys9s-observation-recruitment and retention in the Environmental 
              Engineering and Water Resources Division will be included.  ***
