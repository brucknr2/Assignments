Abstract    :
              9354440  Roy  This project responds to a documented national need for enhanced 
              expertise in the area of materials synthesis and processing by  developing two
              courses on ceramic materials synthesis. The courses  consist of lectures by
              eminent scholars in the field of materials  science and engineering which are
              videotaped. The videotapes are  available to other institutions, and each
              course features a weekly  one-hour call-in period for students to ask questions
              of the  lecturer. The videotapes are also to provide continuing education  to
              faculty members who act as tutors at remote sites where the  courses are
              offered. This approach is significant for faculty  enhancement in fields where
              there is an identified shortage of  faculty with adequate expertise in the
              field. This is true both of  ceramics in general and ceramic materials
              synthesis in particular.  In addition to the videotapes, the tutors and
              students receive  copies of overhead transparencies, scripts, homework problems
              and  solutions, and examinations. The videotapes and instructional  materials
              are disseminated by the Materials Education Council  located at the
              Pennsylvania State University.
