Abstract    :
              9354098  St. John    Mark St. John, President of Inverness Research Associates,
              has  organized a four-day conference in October, 1993 devoted to  systemic
              reform of science instruction in urban school districts.  Eight urban districts
              that are at least three years into  NSF-funded reform efforts will send teams
              to share their  experiences, develop new skills, and contribute to a
              proceedings  volume that will document the lessons learned in these projects. 
              Project leaders from Teacher Enhancement projects in Cleveland,  Buffalo,
              Baltimore,  San Francisco, Pasadena, and Las Vegas will  be primary
              participants. Teams from cities with more recently  initiated reform projects
              (New York, Los Angeles, Brooklyn, and  Cincinnati) will also attend.     The
              monograph resulting from the conference will identify  barriers to systemic
              change encountered by the participating  teams, and the solutions they have
              crafted. Four of the  participating districts will be the subjects of in-depth
              case  studies presented in the monograph. These lessons may prove  essential to
              the many urban districts embarking on systemic  change, including those
              districts eligible for NSF support  through the Urban Systemic Initiative.   
              Cost sharing on this project represents approximately 10% of the  NSF
              contribution.  ***
