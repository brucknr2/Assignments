Abstract    :
              9354741  Anderson  Progressive problem sets and innovative classroom exercises
              are  being developed which can be used in both the high school and  college
              precalculus classroom. These materials present concepts  from various points of
              view, emphasize writing, use technology  where feasible, encourage the use of
              collaborative learning,  and stress the application of mathematics to other
              disciplines.  Guidelines presented in the National Council of Teachers of 
              Mathematics Standards, current research in ways people best  learn mathematics,
              and compatibility with innovative calculus  curricula are being used to
              evaluate the problem sets as they  are developed. The materials consist of
              homework and in-class  problems, as well as suggestions for their use,
              additional  resources for schools without technology, and complete  solutions.
              The problem sets are being pretested as they are  developed; workshops for both
              high school and college teachers,  designed to demonstrate the materials and
              generate feedback,  are being held; and a year-long piloting project, involving
              one  four-year college, one community college, and nine high  schools, is being
              conducted.   ***y
