Abstract    :
              9354017  Clark  This two-year program is designed to serve as a model for the 
              utilization of cooperative relationships between university  professors and
              outstanding two-year college physics faculty  members working together to
              provide professional in-service  enrichment training for two-year college
              physics faculty in the  Southwestern United States.  The program focuses on
              recent  developments in physics research, innovative physics teaching  methods,
              and successful techniques for recruiting local  minority students into two-year
              college science and engineering  programs.  The program includes an annual May
              Institute at  Texas A&M University, academic year follow-up workshops, local 
              projects by participants, and staff visits to participant's  campuses.  ***
