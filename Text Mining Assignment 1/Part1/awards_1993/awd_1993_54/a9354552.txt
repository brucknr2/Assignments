Abstract    :
              9354552  Bagchi         The purpose of this project is to develop a new
              project-based and  applications oriented linear algebra sequence of two courses
              for  science, engineering, and management students. The first of these  courses
              serves as an alternative to calculus for freshment. Drawing  from the
              experience of successful project-based curricula at WPI,  these courses are
              being developed around project work, hands-on  experience with real world
              applications, extensive computer usage,  and written laboratory reports. WPI
              mathematics majors are playing  an important role in the development of this
              curricula as part of  their junior and senior projects. The modular course
              structure  allows flexibility in customizing these courses to student and 
              instructor needs, thereby enhancing portability to other  institutions.  ***y
