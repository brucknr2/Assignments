Abstract    :
              9354473  Zielinski          The project will produce 24-28 physical chemistry
              student centered  learning modules accompanied by an effective set of
              instructional  and assessment materials. These correct student misconceptions
              and  help students to appreciate their own powers of learning. The new  modules
              will focus on stream lining and modernizing the physical  chemistry curriculum
              in order to adequately portray the excitement  and scope of the field while
              addressing the needs of students as  learners. The new modules will incorporate
              well established  pedagogical techniques to engage students in the learning
              process  as they construct concepts in physical chemistry. The new modules 
              will capitalize on the different learning styles of a diverse  student
              population, typically 3rd year male and female science  majors who must take
              physical chemistry.  ***y
