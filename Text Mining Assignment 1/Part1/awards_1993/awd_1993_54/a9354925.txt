Abstract    :
              GER-9354925  University of Maryland-College Park  Heiz                          
                   ABSTRACT    The University of Maryland at College Park proposes to
              establish a  new graduate traineeship program in Ground Water Chemistry and 
              Hydrology.  A very talented faculty in this field has been  assembled over the
              past decade by several departments, acting  independently. Interdepartmental
              coordination of their activities  did not begin until recently.  this
              traineeship program will be the  catalyst for promoting the further
              organization of these scientists  and engineers into a nationally visible
              group.  Maryland can offer  graduate students special opportunities to use
              state-of-the-art  analytical methods (e.d. AMS, EXAFS, TIMS, INAA) in their
              study of  ground water problems.  The State presents an unusual diversity of 
              ground water environments and problems within easy reach of the  campus. 
              Although ground water hydrology/hydrogeology is the  fastest growing area of
              graduate hiring in the earth sciences, the  production of PhDs in this field
              has not increased in nearly two  decades.  A 1991 NRC study has stressed the
              need for  multidisciplinary education in this field, a concept which this 
              proposal addresses specifically.  Integration of fundamental  science and
              engineering research is a goal of the program.  The  program will be managed by
              the Maryland Water Resources Research  Center.
