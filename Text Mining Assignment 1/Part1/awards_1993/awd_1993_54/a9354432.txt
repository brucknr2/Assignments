Abstract    :
              9354432  Lamba         The goal of this project is to revitalize the
              undergraduate  chemistry curriculum by adopting laboratory-driven instruction 
              using the discovery (inquiry) approach. With this approach, new  topics would
              be introduced first in the laboratory and then  discussed more fully during the
              lecture. The central objective is  to develop, implement, evaluate, and
              disseminate a comprehensive  set of instructional modules that will address the
              concerns of  chemistry educators and satisfy the needs of introductory
              chemistry  curricula. The modules will include student handouts, a teacher's 
              guide, and suggestions for their implementation. The modules will  be
              appropriate not only for science majors but also for non-science  majors. 
              Initial development has initiated in the students a  positive response and
              attitude towards chemistry.  Five colleges and universities involved are
              collaborating in  testing the discovery exercises and the instructional
              modules.   Dissemination will be through this broad outreach and materials 
              development.  Evaluation will be carried out during the project and  with
              students after their graduation.  ***y
