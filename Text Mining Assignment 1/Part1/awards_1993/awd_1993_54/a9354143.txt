Abstract    :
              9354143  Falcorner    Spelman College will undertake a six-month planning effort
              to  devise a long-range plan for the development of an excellent  science,
              engineering and mathematics (SEM) education and research  program. The planning
              effort will focus on four major areas.  These areas include: 1) the Academic
              Program; 2) Student  Development; 3) Research & Faculty Development; and 4) the
               Infrastructure.    The major objectives of the planning period will be to:  
              1.  Review and revise procedures for assessing the quality       of SEM
              programs, identifying specific strengths and       weaknesses.   2.  Determine
              activities and resources needed to elevate       SEM programs to a higher level
              of excellence.   3.  Analyze strengths and weaknesses related to recruitment   
                 and retention, and determine activities to enhance       these areas.   4. 
              Analyze research capabilities and determine research-       related needs,
              particularly with respect to the       training of students.   5.  Determine
              tracking procedures and infrastructure       mechanisms needed to ensure
              adequate feedback on SEM       graduates, including enrollment in graduate
              programs,       progress in graduate school and employment data.   6.  Assess
              and develop appropriate mechanisms to enhance       and facilitate cooperative
              endeavors with industry,       government and graduate institutions.   7. 
              Determine components of an effective infrastructure       that will support
              current enhancements and facilitate       future growth.
