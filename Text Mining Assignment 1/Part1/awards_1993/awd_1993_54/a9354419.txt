Abstract    :
              9354419  Wackerly  Many of the students who register for college-level
              introductory  statistics courses have relatively weak backgrounds in
              mathematics  and, more importantly, poor quantitative skills. Although many of 
              these courses have been developed with only high school level  algebra as a
              pre-requisite, the typical content of these courses is  really rather
              sophisticated. Students are expected to understand  concepts such as:
              conditional probability, Bayes' Rule,  independence, sampling distributions of
              statistics, confidence  intervals and tests of hypotheses. The level of student
               understanding of these (nonquantitative) students depends upon how  well they
              are able to envision what might happen if a process  (sample, computation,
              etc.) were repeated over-and-over. This  project will focus on the use of the
              computer as a device for  illustration and "discovery" of important concepts
              that students  have difficulty grasping. Rather than imagine what might happen
              if  a process were repeated over-and-over, the computer can be used to  show
              the students what actually DOES happen. The computer  demonstrations are a
              tremendous aid in classroom presentations of  the concepts and are also very
              valuable in the hands of students,  where they can discover important facts and
              concepts for  themselves. This project will produce (a) the demonstration 
              software in topic modules for Macintosh computers, and (b) manuals  for
              instructor and student use of the software.  Student learning  and attitudes
              will be evaluated.
