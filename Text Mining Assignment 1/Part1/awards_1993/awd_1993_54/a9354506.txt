Abstract    :
              9354506  Breiman  This project, at the University of California, Berkeley, 
              affects almost all of the lower division statistics courses,  with a total
              yearly enrollment of over 2000 students. The goal  is to assist the development
              of statistical and probabilistic  intuition and understanding through the use
              of interactive  computing and graphics.  This project is the next step in the 
              Statistics Department's efforts to improve lower division  instruction, which
              began in 1986 by integrating computing into  the undergraduate curriculum. This
              year, about 2000 lower  division students have ongoing computer assignments. 
              Funded by an  NSF Grant, 50 X-Windows terminals and a more powerful SUN server 
              were installed in 1993. The X-Window terminals allows reaching  students on a
              graphical/intuitive level. In the interactive  windowing environment, different
              views of data can be linked  together and probabilistic concepts illustrated
              dynamically so that  the ideas come alive.  Twenty computer projects will be 
              constructed, corresponding to key concepts discussed in lower  division
              courses. Each project is a small story, consisting of a  number of related
              parts that carry the student into rings of  related material. Each project
              requires responses and initiative on  the part of the students. All parts of
              the project have as their  core the effort to create a setting to give students
              better  understanding of the particular concept being discussed in their 
              classes.  This is a first of its kind in undergraduate statistical 
              instruction.  The leadership position of the Department in the  field of
              statistics, in the use of computing, and in undergraduate  instruction will be
              an important factor in the programs, course  materials, and approach being
              adopted by other universities and  colleges.  ***
