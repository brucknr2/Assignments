Abstract    :
              9354823  Becerra  The objectives of this project are: (1) development of a
              unified  course syllabus for College Algebra which has as its nucleus the 
              process of modeling in diverse settings via elementary functions  and systems
              of equations; (2) integration of technology as a  fundamental medium for
              learning and doing mathematics in College  Algebra; and (3) incorporation of
              laboratory experiences into  College Algebra which promote problem solving
              skills and a  collaborative and highly interactive learning environment. The 
              implementation of these ideas is through the development of a  series of
              laboratory modules which can be taught in conjunction  with any text.  The
              versions produced can be used with current  standard technologies including
              graphing calculators, Mathematica  and Maple. To support these modules,
              packages of high-level  functions are developed which promote visualization and
              simplify  numerical and symbolic computation. Interested faculty at other 
              institutions are able to easily incorporate these modules into  their college
              algebra courses.  A revised College Algebra  curriculum which exploits
              technology and laboratory experiences  addresses some critical concerns of
              national interest: developing  higher level thinking skills in students,
              increasing the  mathematical literacy of students and in particular non-science
               majors, and incorporating teaching delivery styles which aid in the 
              recruitment and retention of minorities into the mathematical  sciences.   ***y
