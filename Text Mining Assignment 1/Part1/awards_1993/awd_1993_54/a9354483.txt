Abstract    :
              9354483  Riggs                                                  This project
              improves the preparation of undergraduate  engineering students to effectively
              contribute to achieving  sustainable development in the U.S. and elsewhere.
              This is  accomplished by developing and implementing a carefully planned  and
              designed sequence of three introductory courses in  sustainable development and
              technology. The courses, developed  by faculty from Civil Engineering,
              Computing, Public Policy,  and Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, feature a multi-
              and inter-  disciplinary learning environment incorporating the latest 
              advances in cognitive science and computer-aided instruction  and learning. All
              educational materials are developed and  packaged in a self-contained way to
              enable other schools to use  the results of this investigation, and to easily
              incorporate  the instructional materials within their own curricula. The 
              sequence not only introduces curricular changes in the way each  course is
              designed and developed, but also in how students  learn and are taught within a
              problem-based, case-based and  collaborative learning and reasoning
              environment.
