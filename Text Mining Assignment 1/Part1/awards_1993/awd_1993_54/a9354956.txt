Abstract    :
              9354956  Russell    Maryland has had a long standing commitment to machine tool 
              research.  The Advanced Design and Manufacturing Laboratory, the 
              Computer-aided Design Laboratory, and the Photomechanics Laboratory  are among
              the leading laboratories in the nation.  On-going  research activities include
              study of machine tool dynamics, ceramic  machining, synthesis and processing of
              multi-layer ceramic  actuators, and development of optical fiber sensor
              technology.   University of Maryland's strong collaboration with industry and 
              government research institutions provides a unique research  environment for
              GRT.    A combined training and retention strategy that emphasizes the 
              integration of design throughout the engineering curriculum at the  graduate
              level has been developed for this proposal.  Developing a  cluster of academic
              courses relevant to machine tool research  allows graduate students to
              integrate ideas and concepts from the  designated courses, and encourages
              intellectual and social  camaraderie to knit the trainees together.  The
              training focuses on  engineering practice and quality research.  Starting from
              learning  operational skills to large-scale system analysis, they gain 
              leading-edge knowledge.  Exciting research projects and strong  interactions
              among students and with teachers will encourage  students to stay in the
              program to pursue their Ph.D. degrees.  ***
