Abstract    :
              9354028  Squires  A series of computer simulations of industrial-type chemical 
              engineering processes designed to be used as senior-level  chemical engineering
              laboratory experiments were developed on  a previous grant.    This project is
              porting five existing computer simulation  software modules (presently written
              for Sun workstations) to    HP, DEC, IBM, and Silicon Graphics workstations. It
              is  estimated that this effort would triple to 36 the number of  chemical
              engineering programs using the modules in senior-level  courses. The project
              involves the application of the new  modules at nine other participating
              schools also.  ***
