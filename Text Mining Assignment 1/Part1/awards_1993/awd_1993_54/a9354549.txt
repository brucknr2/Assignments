Abstract    :
              9354549  Wigley  The Global Change Instruction Program is creating and
              disseminating  a series of innovative teaching materials on global change
              science  and policy for undergraduate nonscience majors.  There is a severe 
              shortage of materials on these topics for this audience.  A series  of
              freestanding modules is designed to pique the interest of  students who think
              science is difficult or boring, to attract more  into careers in research or
              science education, and to help produce  a more scientifically literate
              citizenry.  Because global change  is, by definition, interdisciplinary, the
              modules also help  instructors who are often teaching in areas beyond their own
               expertise.  The materials are being written by specialists and are  designed
              to be flexible enough for use not only in global change  courses but as a focus
              for teaching basic science concepts in  traditional, disciplinary science
              classes.  In Phase 1 of the  project, nine modules were produced.  In Phase 2,
              we are producing  six more printed modules (to fill gaps in the series that 
              professors have identified as most critical); adapting four  supercomputer
              animations for classroom use with the modules; and  disseminating our products.
