Abstract    :
              9354898  Johnson    This fellowship project will train students in robotics and 
              intelligent controls, focusing on the study of adaptive colonies of  adaptive
              robots.    Oberlin College and Valparaiso University, both with active 
              programs to recruit women and ethnic minority undergraduates, will  be feeder
              schools for the Graduate Research Traineeship (GRT)  program.  Indiana
              University will provide enhanced stipends to  recruit and retain women and
              ethnic minority students who might not  otherwise choose a scientific career. 
              The Computer Science  Department will ensure degree completion with additional
              advising  and mentoring activities.    The GRT fellows' analytical skills,
              inter-disciplinary breadth, and  rigorous empiricism will be developed through
              coursework,  collaborations with faculty and senior graduate students at
              Indiana  University, and an external research semester in the Santa Fe 
              Institute's program in adaptive computation.    The experimental component of
              the training program is solidly  founded on the department's innovative
              research, which has produced  the inexpensive miniature hexapod robot Stiquito,
              and analog VLSI  Lukasiewicz logic arrays that are being applied as sensors, 
              inference engines, and controllers for the robot.  GRT fellows will  study the
              principles of adaptive computation, systems  implementation, and mobile
              robotics by simulating, building, and  experimenting with Stiquito colonies.
