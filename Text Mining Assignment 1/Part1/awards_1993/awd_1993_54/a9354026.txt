Abstract    :
              9354026  Tiller  Four one-week short courses in the field of fluid/particle 
              processing and separation will be offered in the summers of  1994-1995.  The
              four short courses are aimed at introducing  faculty members to this important
              field and providing guidance  for teaching related undergraduate courses. The
              four courses  are: particle science and interfacial engineering; 
              fluid/particle separation; fluid/particle processing; and  aerosol processing.
