Abstract    :
              We propose a new initiative in environmental aspects of polymer  science, and in
              particular plastics recycling.  The emphasis of the  training will be on the
              fundamental properties of polymers and  their relation to environmental
              concerns.  A core curriculum is  proposed along with a wide range of course
              options.  Three Ph.D.  thesis topics are described as being typical of the type
              of  research of interest to the five faculty involved.  Interactions  with the
              American Plastics Council and the Environmental Research  Institute are
              described which will provide financial support for he  research, a broadened
              base of training, and a national strategy for  recruiting.
