Abstract    :
              9354330  Laubenbacher   An innovative lower division mathematics course based on
               studying original mathematical texts is being developed. The  course provides
              an introduction to mathematics by examining,  through original sources, the
              evolution of selected great  problems which fueled the development of several
              branches of  mathematics.  The course can serve as a general education  course
              for students in any major who have a good high school  mathematics background,
              providing a stimulating alternative to  the standard "mathematics for liberal
              arts majors" course.
