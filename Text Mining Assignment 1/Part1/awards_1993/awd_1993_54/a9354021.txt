Abstract    :
              9354021   Moloney            A one week workshop is being offered at the
              Rose-Hulman  Institute of Technology in the summer of 1994 to disseminate 
              knowledge and expertise developed in the introductory physics  laboratory at
              Rose-Hulman during a recent NSF grant.The  workshop involves eight to ten
              computer-interfaced introductory  physics experiments, software demonstrations,
              and discussions  of interfacing hardware.  In the evenings each participant 
              builds a versatile PC interface box with A/D converter,  instrumentation
              amplifier, strain gauge, and magnetic field  detector.  Comprehensive software
              packages have been developed  at Rose-Hulman for all interface hardware. 
              Participants get an  overview of these packages, and a look at recently
              developed  classroom and demonstration software.  All of the source code  for
              this software is provided to the participants.A $500  commitment is asked of
              each participant's institution for the  purchase of physics laboratory
              interface equipment.  One  potential gain is the 'recycling' of older PCs to
              the physics  laboratory where even 8088 machines can still be useful.  ***
