Abstract    :
              9354397  Carlson  The recent sharp decline in the number of freshmen planning 
              engineering careers has exacerbated the long-standing problem of  attrition in
              engineering education. Responding to this problem, the  project continues the
              development of a new introductory electronics  laboratory, entitled
              Introduction to Engineering Electronics, that  motivates freshmen for further
              study of engineering.  The course focuses on electronics for motivation, since
              all  branches of engineering use electronic instrumentation. Distinctive 
              course features include an emphasis on interactive learning and  hands-on
              experiences that stimulate curiosity, build confidence,  and demonstrate the
              relevance and rewards of engineering work. The  project has four major
              objectives: (1) assessing the motivational  effectiveness of the course; (2)
              refining the content and structure  based on student response; (3) preparing a
              guidebook and laboratory  manual for use at Rensselaer and for dissemination to
              other  interested institutions; and (4) developing a multimedia laboratory 
              terminal. By achieving these objectives the project addresses  educational
              issues of national significance -- motivation,  retention, hands-on learning,
              and building student confidence.   ***y
