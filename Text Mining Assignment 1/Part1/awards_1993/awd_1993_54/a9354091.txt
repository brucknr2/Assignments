Abstract    :
              9354091  Bybee    BSCS will complete this project in three phases.  The first 
              phase involves commissioning short papers on the general  theme of curriculum
              development.  The papers will consider  different questions and provide a
              provocative and creative,  yet scholarly, basis for the conference.  Each
              author will  present his or her ideas in a short, editorial-length paper.   The
              authors for these editorials will not be from major  curriculum-development
              groups.  The papers will be  distributed prior to the conference and included
              in the  monograph.  Figure 1 displays potential topics and authors  for these
              commissioned papers.    Representatives from both national and local
              curriculum-  development groups also will prepare short editorials on  their
              respective organizations and the priorities, changes,  and projections for the
              next decade.  In particular, they  will address (1) their long-range
              organizational plans, (2)  their responses to the standards-based reform, (3)
              the  factors that facilitate and inhibit curriculum development,  and the
              issues and problems they expect in the next decade.   Figures 2 and 3 display
              the proposed authors and  organizations.  ***
