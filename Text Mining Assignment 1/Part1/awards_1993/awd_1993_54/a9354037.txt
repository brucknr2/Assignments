Abstract    :
              9354037  Krinsky  Los Angeles Urban Mathematics and Science Teacher Preparation 
              Collaborative Development Grant  In order to refine the present course of study
              and to  integrate mathematics, science and technology in the  preservice
              content preparation of undergraduate students a  comprehensive course syllabi
              is being developed for: a)  courses specifically aimed at prospective teachers
              which will  infuse technology into the entire preservice education of 
              prospective teachers; b) content specific/integrated lower  division beginning
              level science courses for future  mathematics and science teachers, with a
              stress on integrated  science content which includes themes of evolution,
              Energy,  Patterns of Change, Scale and Structure, and Systems and  Interactions
              (as specified in the California Science  Framework); c) bridge courses in the
              mathematics curriculum  which help the prospective mathematics teacher make the
               difficult transition from lower division calculus based  courses to upper
              division theory based courses; d) an upper  division "hands on-minds on"
              geometry course for prospective  secondary teachers; and e) an upper division
              course for  prospective secondary teachers which integrates the many 
              disciplines related to environmental science.  University  faculty, including
              outstanding mathematicians and scientists  will work together with secondary
              mathematics and science  teachers to revise course syllabi and pilot the
              targeted  courses.  Cooperating campuses include three of the  California State
              University campuses (Dominguez Hills, Los  Angeles and Northridge), the
              University of California, Santa  Barbara, and Loyola Marymount.  ***
