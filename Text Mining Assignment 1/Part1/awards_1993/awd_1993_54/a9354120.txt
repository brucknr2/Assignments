Abstract    :
              9354120  Ford    Southern University and A&M College System (SUS) proposes to 
              continue to make Southern University and A&M College at Baton  Rouge (SUBR) a
              Model Institution for Excellence (MIE) in science,  engineering, and
              mathematics (SEM) education and research.     SUBR's quantified objectives
              include (a) the yearly production of  400 and 640, natural science,
              mathematics, and engineering (NSEM)  and SEM graduates respectively, by 1998;
              (b) a measurable  enhancement of the quality of SEM programs, infrastructure,
              and  specially of SEM graduates; and (c) the guiding of at least 200  of its
              SEM graduates to the successful pursuit of SEM graduate  degrees, with emphasis
              on the Ph.D. These outcome-objectives will  be attained through
              process-objectives consisting of involving  and getting input and support from
              partners that include the  National Science Foundation, State and federal
              governments,  private industry, and the precollege and Ph.D. program 
              communities. These objectives are direct corollaries of the  mission of
              Southern University and A&M College. This mission  comprises quality
              instruction, research and development, and  public and professional service.   
              The development of the detailed strategic plan will address the  following: (1)
              reassertion of the objectives; (2) the development  of premises to include the
              reassessment of internal and external  factors and trends; (3) the decisions or
              the selection of  strategies; (4) the details of the implementation, with time 
              table and measures of success; and (5) the monitoring,  evaluation, and related
              adjustments and updating. Existing plans,  reports, and the content of the
              literature will constitute key  instruments.
