Abstract    :
              9354029  Kimmel  Redesigning Introductory Physical Science Courses to Focus on 
              the Learner as a Prospective Teacher Abstract    New Jersey Institute of
              Technology (NJIT), Fairleigh  Dickinson University (FDU), Jersey City State
              College (JCSC),  and Montclair State College (MSC) are collaborating in the 
              planning and testing of undergraduate science courses that  combine teaching
              methodology and content in courses for all  students.  The courses involved at
              each of the four campuses  are chemistry, physics, and earth/spaces sciences. 
              The  project explores an integrated exposure to teaching  strategies and
              content by folding pedagogy into selected  topics in each of the disciplines. 
              NJIT and FDU are working  with topics in chemistry courses, MSC is focusing on
              physics  topics, and JCSC is working with earth/space science.   Evaluation
              methodologies concentrate on assessing students'  understanding of the topics
              affected.  The science courses  will become part of the reform curriculum for
              teacher  preparation, yet recognize that every student is a  prospective
              educator in any of a variety of settings.  The  concept that college courses
              combine pedagogy and content  should be the basis for all science and
              mathematics courses  that serve all students as part of the core 
              curricular/general requirements of the collaborating  institutions.  ***
