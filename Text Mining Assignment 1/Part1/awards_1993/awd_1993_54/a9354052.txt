Abstract    :
              9354052  Shapiro  Teacher Education Addressing Mathematics and Science in 
              Boston and Cambridge (TEAMS - BC)       TEAMS-BC is a collaboration of Harvard
              University,  Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Wheelock College, 
              University of Massachusetts-Boston, Boston Public Schools,  and Cambridge
              Public Schools.  The collaborative is  addressing the weaknesses in the
              preparation of elementary,  middle, and secondary science and mathematics
              teachers by (1)  involving university and college science and mathematics 
              faculty, along with education faculty and teachers, in the  cooperative
              development of science and mathematics courses in  teacher preparation
              programs; (2) emphasizing teaching for  understanding and integrating content
              area and effective  instructional practices; (3) creating ten Professional 
              Development Schools which cooperate with the teacher  preparation programs -
              four elementary, two middle, and four  high school - with special emphasis on
              mathematics and  science, training mentor teachers in the enquiry, hands-on, 
              case study based approach being developed; and (4)  establishing seminars at
              schools for teachers and university  faculty to discuss problems in teaching
              effectively.  Other  emphases of the project are the recruitment of minority 
              students to teacher preparation programs, creation and  promotion of area
              business-academic-school partnership  programs in which both pre-service and
              in-service teachers  will participate in the application of mathematics and 
              science in business and industry and use this knowledge to  develop pedagogical
              materials for classroom use; and  coordination with major mathematics and
              science initiatives  in Boston and Cambridge.
