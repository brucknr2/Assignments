Abstract    :
              9354103  Novak    About one thousand (1,000) pages of text and graphics form the
               Third International Seminar on Misconceptions and Educational  Strategies in
              Science and Mathematics will be made available on  floppy disc, DC-ROM, and on
              the Internet.  Full Text access is  therefore available from conference
              proceedings that would  otherwise be difficult to search when using a paper
              copy.  The  project will explore the merits and problems of various electronic 
              formats and distribution systems through a series of evaluations.   The
              findings are potentially useful to science and mathematics  educators, library
              and information science professionals and  university students.  ***
