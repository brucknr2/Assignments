Abstract    :
                The filamentous fungi are organisms of unusual importance.  They  are the
              major cause of plant diseases.  As producers of  mycotoxins in infected plant
              products, they cause significant  losses of agricultural products and are a
              grave health concern  for man and animals.  Fungi are the primary organisms
              responsible  for the decomposition of woody plant tissues and hold the 
              potential for bioconversion of plant waste into valuable  products.  Fungi form
              associations with plants that enhance plant  productivity and fungi are
              important producers of both foods and  medicines.  Thus, increase fungal
              research efforts are warranted,  both to decrease the damage that fungi cause
              to plants and to  increase their potential to enhance the value of plant
              products.   Recently, Texas A&M University has made a concerted effort to 
              attract scientists with common interests in fungal biology.  We  recognize the
              potential for future scientific breakthroughs in  the manipulation of fungi for
              the benefit of society.  Our goal  is for Texas A&M to become a leader in
              fungal biology research as  it relates to plant biology.  To this end, we have
              established  interactions between research groups investigating diverse 
              problems in fungal biology.  Scientists graduating from this  program will have
              an immediate impact in areas of critical  importance for agricultural,
              industrial, environmental, and  governmental needs.
