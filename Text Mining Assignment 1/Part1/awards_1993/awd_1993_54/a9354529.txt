Abstract    :
              9354529  Derry  Literacy and informed decision making in an uncertain world
              require the  ability to reason statistically. However, research indicates that 
              although conceptions of statistics and probability have steadily  advanced
              within scientific and mathematical communities, adults in  mainstream American
              society cannot think probabilistically or  statistically about important
              societal issues. This project therefore  presents a novel undergraduate course
              targeting students who are  considering a career in teaching. The course is
              designed to help  students employ statistical concepts as tools for social
              reasoning  within simulations of real-world problem situations. Reusable 
              instructional materials are being designed and will be disseminated to  assist
              faculty at other universities who wish to offer the course.  The course will
              also interact with the community, focus on cultural  diversity, and is expected
              to achieve a high degree of authenticity  through simulations of realistic
              social problem solving.
