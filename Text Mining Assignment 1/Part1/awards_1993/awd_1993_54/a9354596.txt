Abstract    :
              9354596  Keeffe           The project will develop molecular
              modelling/computational  chemistry experiments for use in first-year organic
              chemistry  courses. Computational chemistry, rapidly becoming an almost 
              routine tool for academic and industrial chemists, offers an  unusually good
              opportunity for students to investigate efficiently  a variety of molecular
              attributes including conformational  stability, preferred bond angles and
              lengths, energies of reaction,  and reaction pathways. Results can provide
              rationalization of known  data, or predictions subject to verification. These
              benefits will  accrue only with the aid of a high quality, integrated 
              visualization environment, a feature central to our proposal.  These
              experiments will be introduced as hands-on exercises to our  organic lab
              students: 240-280 students per year, including  chemistry and biochemistry
              majors and most pre-health profession  students. Our ca. 500 organic lecture
              students each year will be  shown the results - both numerical and pictorial -
              of a variety of  pertinent computations. This group of students includes all of
              our  biology majors and those training for precollege science teaching 
              careers.  ***y
