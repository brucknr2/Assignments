Abstract    :
              9354722  Reingold  We are completely restructuring the material traditionally
              covered  in the first three years of college chemistry curricula. Our new 
              structure solves many of the problems we and others have found with  the
              traditional approach, including the widely advertised  shortcomings of the
              freshman course and the less-widely  acknowledged problems with the organic
              course, chief among which is  the fact that it covers too much synthetic
              chemistry and too little  biochemistry for the majority of the students taking
              it, who tend  to be biology and premedical students.  Our solution is to move
              the  organic course to the freshman year and tailor it to its audience, 
              emphasizing biomedical connections and removing much of the pure  synthetic
              organic chemistry.  Obviously, this has a trickle-down  effect on the rest of
              the curriculum:  some of what used to be  freshman chemistry is now being
              taught in the sophomore year, as  inorganic and analytical chemistry, and the
              parts of organic  omitted from the freshman year are being addressed in the
              junior  year.  The restructuring has also given us the opportunity to work 
              with the biology department in a complete overhaul of labs for the  first two
              years, resulting in a joint freshman lab experience and  an intensification of
              the sophomore lab experience.  Finally, we  have created a course designed to
              introduce our environmental  science program.  Overall we expect this new
              curriculum to serve  both chemistry students and students in the other sciences
              better  than the old curriculum.
