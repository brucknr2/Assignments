Abstract    :
              9354692  LoPresti  Wheelock College is undertaking a three year project, Focus
              on  Science, which runs simultaneously with the pre-service  collaborative
              project Teacher Education Addressing Mathematics and  Science in Boston and
              Cambridge (TEAMS-BC).  Through TEAMS-BC,  Wheelock College faculty are
              developing new courses and revising  existing courses in science and
              mathematics education in order to  develop a coordinated science and
              mathematics program for students  in elementary and early childhood education. 
              In addition, Wheelock  is working closely with professional development schools
              in Boston  and Cambridge to assure that the field experiences of students 
              support their learning in science and mathematics for children.  This project
              focuses on the implementation of an intensive  formative assessment process
              within the courses undergoing change,  to both document and analyze student
              growth, and to develop  assessment practices that are embedded into the design
              of the new  courses.  This project also supports collaborative efforts with the
               Martin Luther King, Jr. School in Cambridge to build a professional 
              development school.  Teachers and faculty are working closely  together to
              build the science teaching capacity at the school, to  provide the clinical
              experience for students that will enhance  their skills in teaching science to
              children, and to reach out to  the community of the school.
