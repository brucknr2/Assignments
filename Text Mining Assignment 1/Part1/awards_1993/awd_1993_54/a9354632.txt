Abstract    :
              9354632  Reisert  To enhance the science preparation of future teachers and
              encourage  science majors to become teachers, the Department of natural 
              Sciences and the Department of Education at Assumption College are  developing
              an education laboratory section for the one semester  introductory biology
              course,Concepts in Biology.  This laboratory  section will be designed for
              students who take the course to  complete the laboratory science requirement
              for Massachusetts  elementary school certification.  Three weeks will be spent
              on each  of the following topics: the cell, carbohydrate metabolism, 
              photosynthesis and genetics. In the first week of the course the  students will
              do the college -level exercises planned for all  sections on these topics.  In
              week two, with the assistance of  science and education faculty, students
              select and design exercises  for a particular elementary level.  The students
              are graded on the  portfolios they develop.  Elementary school children will
              visit the  College in the third week, through a collaboration with a local 
              elementary school.  The students will evaluate the exercise they  have taught. 
              By including an elementary school visit to each of  the traditional labs
              science majors will also have an opportunity  to teach.
