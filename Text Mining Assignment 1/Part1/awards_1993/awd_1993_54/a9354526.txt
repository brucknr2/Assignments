Abstract    :
              9354526  Wink                                                   The chemistry
              and mathematics departments of the University of  Illinois at Chicago propose
              to develop a common curriculum for  preparatory instruction in general
              chemistry and intermediate  algebra. The course, dubbed "The MATCH Program" to
              reflect its  origins, will be offered to students who require preparatory 
              courses in order to succeed in college, because of deficiencies in  the their
              educational background or because they are returning to  their higher education
              several years after graduation from high  school. The impetus for the
              curriculum comes from a recognition  that such students, who may be very
              important in the composition of  the nation's technical personnel in the
              future, will likely do  better if these courses are combined so that
              mathematics and  chemistry instruction reinforce each other explicitly.  The 
              proposed work will be conducted over a three year period, with a  planned
              transition from a small developmental program through to  one that can be used
              at other institutions. Cooperative learning  strategies and laboratory program
              will be key elements of the  instructional effort. The development, evaluation,
              and  implementation plans all include close consultation with faculty  from
              other schools, who have either had experience with similar  programs or who
              recognize a similar need for this program for their  students. Finally, a
              careful and rigorously controlled assessment  program will be included.  ***
