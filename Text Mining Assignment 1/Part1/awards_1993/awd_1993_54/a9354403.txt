Abstract    :
              9354403  Rizzoni      The principal goal of this project is to develop an
              innovative  curriculum in Electro-Mechanical (Mechatronic) System Design. This 
              innovative curriculum integrates electrical, electronic,  mechanical, and
              computational engineering by introducing the  innovative use of videos and
              computers into the classroom and  laboratory. Emphasized is the use of a
              variety of CAD tools in  engineering design and analysis. A realistic
              engineering problem  setting is provided in the laboratory to enable the
              students to  address design and experimental issues in engineering.  The 
              objectives are accomplished through an integrated curriculum,  cross-listing
              many relevant EE and ME courses, and a Motion Control  in Electro-Mechanical
              Systems Laboratory in which the students are  exposed to the electrical,
              electronic, mechanical, and  computational aspects of motion control and
              hybrid-electric  vehicles.  Students electing this curriculum receive a
              certificate  of study in Electro-Mechanical System Design and complete their 
              senior design projects using the facilities available in the Motion  Control in
              Electro-Mechanical Systems Laboratory. Through this  curriculum the
              undergraduate students identify creatively capstone  design projects in
              electro-mechanical systems. The design projects  are realized through the open
              use of the laboratory and with the  participation of industrial sponsors who
              assist in defining  projects.  ***y
