Abstract    :
              9354547  LaRose  The purpose of this proposal is to further develop the TEME 
              (Totally Enclosed Modular Environments) model as the experiential  laboratory
              of the Human Ecology curriculum. Expanding the TEME  model to include an
              oceanographic research simulation will enable  Greenfield Community College to
              provide both college and middle  school students with an opportunity to
              participate in an exciting  hands-on science education program that integrates
              broad scientific  content and effective group skills, providing a practical
              framework  for understanding ecological and social problems.  The original 
              TEME curriculum model features a simulated shuttle orbiter  experience as a
              metaphor for "Spaceship Earth." The TEME model will  be adapted to the study of
              the oceans, using a deep sea submersible  simulation as a vehicle for exploring
              this vast and still  mysterious environment. We will add new content to the
              module  program and upgrade the technology to run the simulation. In  addition
              to Greenfield Community College faculty,  curriculum  specialists, and middle
              school teachers are involved in the  curriculum development. We will develop
              written curricular  materials for middle schools as well as software that can
              be used  on ordinary PCs in the schools.  The impact on students will  include
              greater motivation, improved math/science skills  development, greater clarity
              of career goals, and a broader  ecological awareness.   ***
