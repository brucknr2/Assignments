Abstract    :
              9354137  Andrade    The University of Texas at El Paso's (UTEP) planning project
              has  the goal of determining institutional priorities and strategies  needed to
              achieve excellence in SEM education during the next 10  years, with a
              particular focus on increasing the number of  minority students who achieve an
              undergraduate education of the  highest quality.     Planning activities will
              focus on development of a strategic plan  and institutional structures for
              achieving and maintaining  excellence in undergraduate SEM programs. This will
              include  defining excellence in the context of UTEP's mission and  determining
              what will be required to achieve excellence in SEM  programs. UTEP will
              carefully assess the strengths, impediments,  and potentials of undergraduate
              science, engineering and  mathematics programs at UTEP and identify those
              program areas and  those institutional and departmental strategies that have
              the  greatest potential for future improvement.
