Abstract    :
              9354652  Johnson         Funds are requested to create a unique Mathematics
              Across the  Curriculum program that will be disseminated nationally as a 
              paradigm for enhancing mathematics education. It will affect every 
              undergraduate student on campus by integrating the use of  mathematics into all
              core curriculum (general education) classes.  Long-term goals of the project
              are to improve students' proficiency  in mathematics by routine use throughout
              their general education;  reduce "math anxiety" and generate more positive
              attitudes toward  mathematics and science, especially among future K-12
              teachers; and  help break down barriers to technical career choices.  A
              prominent feature of the program is a Mathematics Center with a  full time
              Director which will provide support for the program by  serving as a resource
              for non-mathematics faculty in developing a  new mathematics-intensive
              curriculum; training student "Math  Mentors" to assist faculty and students in
              the application of  mathematics in non-mathematics courses; developing methods
              to  assess mathematical skills in all core classes; sponsoring Visiting 
              Distinguished Scholars to promote faculty dialogue across  disciplines;
              providing computers, video players, and tutors to  support students; and
              producing aids for student learning,  including video tapes.  A very successful
              Writing Across the Curriculum program served by  a Writing Center has been
              underway for four years at the University  of Nevada, Reno, and will serve as a
              model for Mathematics Across  the Curriculum. Dissemination of the entire
              program nationally is  a major goal of this proposal and will be aggressively
              undertaken.  ***y
