Abstract    :
              9354097  Tinker    Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are collections of 
              spatially aggregated data and programs to manipulate the  data to answer
              questions in geography, earth science,  environmental science and other
              disciplines.  These systems  have the potential to make major contributions to
              what  students learn and how they learn it.  In a three-day  workshop those who
              develop and study GIS, those who use GIS  in research in various disciplines
              and educators are brought  together to obtain an understanding of GIS and its
              potential  uses in education.  The workshop consists of written papers  to form
              the basis for discussion, plenary talks, breakout  sessions and demonstrations.
               The issues include technical  (the present and future state of GIS),
              educational  (disciplines, examples, costs teacher enhancement), and  cognitive
              science (what new concepts and processes students  can learn).  The conference
              provides a consensus of the  potential for GIS in schools and an outline of the
              steps to  reach that potential.    ***
