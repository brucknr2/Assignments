Abstract    :
              9354027  Miller  The aim of this project is to provide teachers of undergraduate
               science and engineering courses with sufficient curricular  background and
              information to enable them to introduce the  subject of materials science into
              existing introductory courses  or to develop a new introductory course in this
              area. The  project targets teachers in four-year colleges and in community 
              colleges in the Pacific Northwest region.  The summer component  of this
              project entails an intensive two-week program in  materials science with
              lectures, small group discussions,  laboratories and research sessions for a
              group of 30 college  science, engineering and technology instructors. The
              variety of  activities built into the workshop sessions enables  participants
              to gain hands-on knowledge of the materials field  and of working laboratory
              experiments that can be used in their  home institutions, while insuring that
              they have sufficient  time to learn and reinforce needed basic understanding in
              the  materials area.  The academic year follow-up activities in the  program
              include curriculum development activities by  participants interacting by
              computer; and a weekend meeting on  campus during the academic year will
              reinforce these activities  and provide additional background and advanced
              topic lectures  to participants.  ***
