Abstract    :
              9354033  Stein  Rocky Mountain Teacher Education Collaborative (RMTEC)          
                 The University of Northern Colorado (UNC), Colorado State  University (CSU)
              and Metropolitan State College of Denver  (MSCD), as partners in the Rocky
              Mountain Teacher Education  Collaborative (RMTEC), propose a five-year project
              which will  redesign targeted university science and mathematics courses, 
              integrating content and pedagogy; redesign the teacher  certification programs
              for middle and secondary science and  mathematics teachers at RMTEC
              institutions; and serve as a  national model for recruiting and retaining
              certification  candidates from underrepresented groups, transfer and 
              nontraditional-aged students.  This Collaborative is unique,  providing
              leadership through CSU, a research-oriented, land-  grant university which has
              the largest secondary science  teacher education program in the state; UNC, a
              university  that holds a state-recognized mission for teacher education  and
              one of the largest elementary and middle school teacher-  preparation programs
              nationally; and MSCD, a four-year  college in downtown Denver committed to
              training teachers for  urban schools and the largest middle and secondary math 
              education program in the state.  RMTEC partners will design a  national model
              to better prepare middle and secondary  preservice teachers in science and
              mathematics by  emphasizing: the ongoing collaboration between teacher 
              education institutions, community colleges, and K-12 school  partners for the
              reform of science and mathematics by  emphasizing: the ongoing collaboration
              between teacher  education institutions, community colleges, and K-12 school 
              partners for the reform of science and mathematics teacher  preparation: the
              redesign and delivery of targeted science  and mathematics courses for majors,
              with a central focus on  research-based teaching and learning strategies such
              as  inquiry, problem-solving, and constructivist approaches and  utilizing
              appropriate interactive technologies; the   enhancement of preservice teachers'
              Pedagogical Content  Knowledge (PCK) by integrating content, pedagogy, and 
              practice through the modeling of effective teaching,  developing a new CORE
              experience for student cohorts, and  integrally involving experienced mentor
              teachers; the  development of faculty, mentor teacher, and student skills in 
              addressing classroom diversity issues and the recruitment and  retention of
              women and other underrepresented groups in  mathematics and science teacher
              preparation programs.  The  RMTEC institutions have also committed funds to 
              accomplishment of project goals, and project staff are  working collaboratively
              with the participants in the Colorado  Statewide Strategic Initiative. 
              Dissemination of the  national models will occur through presentations at
              regional  and national conferences; publications in science,  mathematics, and
              education journals, and conference sponsored  by each of the partner
              institutions.  ***y
