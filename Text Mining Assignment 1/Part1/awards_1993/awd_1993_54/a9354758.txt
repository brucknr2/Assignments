Abstract    :
              9354758  Lewis  The problems with general science education, the science
              literacy  of college graduates, and attitudes toward science have been well 
              documented. This proposal addresses these problems through the  development of
              a new two-course sequence for the general college  student. This sequence will
              use an active learning approach and a  unique interdisciplinary structure to
              engage students in examining  the connections among the sciences and between
              science and their  lives. Rather than presenting the standard science
              disciplines as  separate entities, the courses will use broad ideas such as 
              conservation principles, the organization of systems, and the flow  of
              information to look at science as a comprehensive human  endeavor. The sequence
              will be designed to achieve both science  literacy and science skills
              objectives. The design builds upon  experimental modules tested in existing
              courses during 1992 and  1993 at Kennesaw State College. When developed, this
              sequence is  expected to become the required core science sequence taken by
              most  students at Kennesaw State College.   ***y
