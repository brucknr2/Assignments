Abstract    :
              9354647  Zumoff   This project is broadening and disseminating the concept of 
              Earth Algebra. Earth Algebra is an entry level college algebra  course which
              incorporates the spirit of the NCTM Curriculum and  Evaluation Standards for
              School Mathematics at the college  level. The context of the course places
              mathematics in the  center of one of the major current concerns of the world,
              i.e.,  environmental issues and global warming. In this project  mathematicians
              at Kennesaw are developing and testing materials  (EarthMath Studies) designed
              in the spirit of Earth Algebra  which can be used in a wider range of courses.
              Specifically,  the Earth Algebra concept is being expanded into two areas: 
              precalculus, both algebra and trigonometry, and mathematics  education courses
              as a tool for training preservice teachers.  The EarthMath Studies are in  the
              form of studies of  environmental issues which involve modeling and analysis of
               real data, use of technology, group work, written and oral  reports and
              student research. In addition to Kennesaw State  College, seven institutions
              are testing and piloting the  materials. The goals of the use of EarthMath
              materials are to  improve students problem solving and decision making ability,
               to offer insight and increase interest in and appreciation of  the role of
              mathematics in society, enhance the learning of the  mathematical skills and
              concepts prerequisite to calculus, and  to provide preservice teachers with a
              model of how the  Standards can be implemented.
