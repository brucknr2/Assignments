Abstract    :
              9354125  SubbaRao    Lincoln University will develop strategies to increase the
              number  of minority students who enter science, engineering and  mathematics
              (SEM) fields. The proposed approach will develop  strategies to assist minority
              students at critical stages in  their academic life. For example, a variety of
              intervention  activities at the pre-college, community college, 4-year college 
              and graduate school levels would be utilized to prepare, motivate  and
              encourage several hundred urban minority students to pursue  advanced degrees
              in SEM. Special attention will be paid to  developing strategies that enhance
              recruitment, retention and  graduation rates.    A key component of the
              proposed effort will establish  partnerships and articulation agreements with
              regional community  colleges, secondary schools, and with majority universities
               involving faculty exchange and collaboration, student support,  student
              enrichment activities, and facilitation of transfer to  and from Lincoln
              University. Lincoln University plans to improve  its SEM curriculum to make it
              more challenging, exciting,  relevant, and to explore the possibility of
              introducing new  programs, while at the same time, designing activities to
              enhance  the teaching skills and methods of SEM faculty; improving 
              faculty/student research capabilities; renovating and expanding  laboratory
              space and equipment for teaching and research, as well  as establishing
              multimedia capability. Finally, the project  develops strategies to involve
              government agencies, private  foundations, and corporations in strengthening
              SEM programs and  the infrastructure at Lincoln University.
