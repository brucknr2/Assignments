Abstract    :
              9354051  Gadson  Curriculum Development for Science Teacher Preparation        
              A consortium has been formed to design specific approaches to  improving the
              quality of undergraduate science teacher  preparation and increasing
              substantially the quality  and  number of Black and Hispanic teachers in
              science.  The  consortium will design fresh, comprehensive, and coordinated 
              approaches to reform science teacher preparation involving  intra-institutional
              and inter-institutional collaboration.  Faculties in the departments of
              biology, chemistry, physics,  mathematics, and science education from Florida
              A&M  University, University of Florida, University of South  Florida, Bethune
              Cookman University, and Florida Memorial  University, along with lead science
              teachers from Leon, Dade,  and Volusia School Districts, will convene for two
              weekends.   They will develop an articulated program model for a four-  year
              comprehensive curriculum for teacher preparation in  science education in the
              areas of biology, chemistry, and  physics at the five major institutions.  The
              program will be  characterized by interdisciplinary experiences, use of new 
              pedagogies, and clinical experiences.  The curriculum model  will be
              disseminated throughout the U.S. through newsletters  and professional
              journals.  ***y
