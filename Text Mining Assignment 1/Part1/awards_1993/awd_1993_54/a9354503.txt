Abstract    :
              It is the premise of this project that students become more  interested in
              learning, and retain more, in courses that rely on  active rather than passive
              teaching methods. If active learning  techniques are to be incorporated into
              science curricula  efficiently, they need to be developed and made available 
              nationally to undergraduate institutions. The goal of required  undergraduate
              science courses is to produce scientifically literate  individuals. Cooperative
              learning activities can be used to  strengthen the skills associated with a
              scientifically literate  citizen. Cooperative learning within a small peer
              group  necessitates an active effort on the part of each group member.  
              Astronomy is often the choice of undergraduate non-science majors  to satisfy a
              science requirement. This project is developing a  variety of cooperative
              learning activities which can be easily  incorporated into introductory
              astronomy courses nationally. An  activities sourcebook offered nationally has
              the potential to  impact a large number of undergraduates and to provide
              faculty with  teaching materials.
