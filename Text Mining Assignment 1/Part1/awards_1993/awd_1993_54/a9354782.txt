Abstract    :
              9354782  O'Connell             Courses in Climate Change, Global Warming and
              Paleoclimatology  are a recent addition to most earth and environmental science
               curricula.  Most courses do not include laboratory exercises.  Climate change
              is a subject which is ideally suited to teach  students computer and analytical
              skills. It can be used to  encourage them to look at data and to draw their own
               conclusions, and thus to question predictions and solutions  that are not
              based on thoughtful and thorough analyses of the  available information. They
              can learn that in science there is  often no single clear-cut answer. I propose
              to develop an  integrated course syllabus using available texts and journal 
              articles with six, climate-oriented laboratory exercises.  Developing the
              laboratory exercises is the main focus of this  proposal. The exercises should
              be adaptable to most Climate  Change courses and would be used to teach
              students to collect  and analyze data with a spreadsheet (using Microsoft
              Excell),  to develop simple model simulations (using Stella II), and to 
              manipulate and present data in variety of visibly useful  formats (using
              Spyglass Transform 2.0). They would learn to use  these programs as a component
              in assessing climate change from  both the geological and modern record. The
              resulting course  would be highly interactive, with students thinking through 
              their own answers. This format will better prepare them to  address the complex
              environmental and social questions of the  21st century.  ***
