Abstract    :
              9354034  Hillman    The Temple University's Colleges of Arts & Sciences, 
              Education, and Engineering & Architecture, the Community  College of
              Philadelphia, the School District of Philadelphia  and PATHS/PRISM-the
              Education Partnership have joined to  develop a new model for the education of
              prospective K-12  teachers which integrates new teaching methodologies with 
              math and science core content courses.  Since Temple  University, in
              conjunction with Community College, is the  major teacher preparation
              institution for the Philadelphia  School District, this will have a systemic
              impact on the  200,000 students in the Philadelphia School District and  serve
              as a national urban model.    The Collaborative will revise selected basic
              college math and  sciences courses to reflect closely the pedagogies and 
              content that the students will need as teachers.  These  revisions will
              include:  enhanced faculty/student  interaction, appropriate instructional
              materials, inquiry-  intensive methodologies as well as new technologies. 
              Several  courses will be developed and modified, including, for  example, a
              team-taught cross-disciplinary science course and  a cognitive psychology
              course. Prospective teachers will  participate in practica early in their
              pre-service training  at specially selected Professional Development schools.  
              Practicum supervisors will join intending teachers in  seminars to reinforce
              content and pedagogy.  The model will  include expansion of Temple's 5-year
              teacher education  program in which students who major in Arts & Sciences and 
              minor in education are certified after completing their 5th  year.  University
              and Community College faculty will  participate in intensive staff development
              and cross-class  visitations with School District teachers.  After careful 
              evaluation, the model will be widely disseminated through a  national
              conference and a variety of presentations.
