Abstract    :
              9354515  Caffery  The goal of this project is to develop materials which will 
              integrate molecular modeling into the chemistry curriculum as a  means of
              understanding chemical structure and as a tool for  developing critical
              thinking skills. The plan will involve students  in using this tool while
              emphasizing thinking skills from simple  analysis and comparison through
              inference and finally, synthesis of  results and evaluation of findings. The
              approach is innovative in  that it calls for integration of the techniques
              across the major  program rather than use in isolated experiments and exercises
               developed and used by individual faculty members. It provides a  creative
              means of explicitly developing thinking skills and for  fostering team work. 
              This project will focus primarily on courses  taken by first and second year
              chemistry and biology majors and  will include selected upper division courses
              in which the technique  has significant applications. We also believe that
              non-science  majors can learn to model simple molecules and have included them 
              in our design. They will learn science by "doing what scientists  do."  ***y
