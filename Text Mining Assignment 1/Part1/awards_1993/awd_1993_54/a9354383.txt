Abstract    :
              9354383  Dubeck           This project will write a 1OO-page-long environmental
              supplement (A  World View of Environmental Issues) which will be published by 
              Saunders College Publishing to accompany the textbook Physics: A  World View,
              by Kirkpatrick and Wheeler, which has sold 15,000  copies in its first year.
              Over a 3-5 year period, an estimated  50,000 copies of the supplement will be
              shrinkwrapped with the text  and offered free of charge to all students and
              faculty. Formative  testing of the supplement and student evaluations of the
              topics  covered will be conducted in large introductory physics courses at 
              Temple University. Each topic will describe the way society reacts  to
              scientific and technological developments through the legal  system. The
              depiction of these issues in the visual mass media will  also be analyzed. The
              environmental issues to be discussed are:  nuclear power plants and-nuclear
              waste; indoor air pollution;  stratospheric ozone depletion and the greenhouse
              effect; and  electromagnetic waves: effects on humans. The staff consists of
              one  physicist who has co-authored several textbooks/instructor's  manuals, one
              environmental lawyer with a biology background, two  environmental engineers, a
              media specialist, and a research  librarian. The authors of Physics: A World
              View and Saunders staff  will help produce the supplement. The staff will write
              articles  describing the supplement and student reactions to the topics.
