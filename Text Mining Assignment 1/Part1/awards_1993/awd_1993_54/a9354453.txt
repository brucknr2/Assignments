Abstract    :
              9354453  Lewis  The project will develop high-end workstation quality computer 
              graphics to aid in the visualization of concepts taught throughout  an
              undergraduate chemistry curriculum. The goal of the work is to  focus on visual
              presentations, and real-time visual manipulations,  of a variety of concepts
              that are included in the current chemistry  curriculum. Specific projects
              include 3-dimensional animation  sequences of atomic and molecular orbitals,
              3-D views of polymer  structure and stereochemistry, videos that introduce
              basic  stereochemical concepts in organic chemistry, and animated  sequences of
              crystal structures and Miller index planes. Additional  projects include other
              basic organic transformations, periodic  trends, and hybridization. The
              specific goals of this project are  to develop materials that can be used in
              courses throughout the  U.S. and can be readily distributed on computer disks,
              laser disks,  and video tapes, so that the efforts of this project can have a 
              broad impact on the national undergraduate and high school  chemistry
              curriculum.  ***y
