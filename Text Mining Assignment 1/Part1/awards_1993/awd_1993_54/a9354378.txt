Abstract    :
              9354378  Sarquis  Faculty at two two-year campuses are revising the General
              Chemistry  course to make it more interesting, relevant, and accessible to 
              students with various academic backgrounds.  This effort includes  the design,
              development, and testing of discovery-based laboratory  scenarios and take-home
              lecture supplements that illustrate topics  in Chemistry through activities
              beyond the classroom.  In addition  to demonstrating general concepts, the
              activities also involve  students in critical-thinking and group
              problem-solving skills used  by professional chemists in industry and academia.
               To further  ensure success, the project is built on the pedagogical
              foundations  of constructivism, Science-Technology-Society, and cooperative 
              learning.  Following pilot implementation and revision, these  advances in the
              General Chemistry curriculum will provide a model  for adaptation at other
              two-year colleges and small four-year  schools.  ***y
