Abstract    :
              9354001  Traficante  NMR Concepts will hold three workshops that will improve
              the  ability of faculty to conduct research and to teach NMR courses  to
              undergraduates.  Each workshop will be 10 days in length,  and will consist of
              NMR lectures, laboratory and problem  solving sessions, keynote speakers, and
              round table discussions  to aid the faculty in incorporating the new knowledge
              into  their research efforts and into their courses.  The first  workshop will
              focus on the physics of NMR experiments, and how  raw data is received and
              processed.  The second workshop deals  with the interpretation of one
              dimensional information received  from the instrument, with emphasis on
              chemical applications.   The last workshop covers the most advanced
              two-dimensional  experiments that are presently being used to solve current 
              chemical problems in industry and in academia.  An annual  reunion will be held
              for participants in these workshops to  exchange successes, failures, and ideas
              for improving the  implementation of these NMR methods into the undergraduate 
              curriculum.   ***
