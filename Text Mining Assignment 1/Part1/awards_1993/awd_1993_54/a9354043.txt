Abstract    :
              9354043  Huang  Teacher Preparation Enhanced by Collaboration among 
              Institutions and Developing Mentorships  This project aims to establish a
              program for prospective  math/science teachers by revising courses such that
              they are  relevant to an urban environment and to at risk students.   The
              approach emphasizes learning and teaching through  investigation, critical
              reasoning and problem solving.  To  achieve these goals New York University
              plans to 1) develop a  collaborative relationship with the City University of
              New  York, several science museums and pubic colleges in the city,  and a
              school district.  2) initiate a pilot program for  teaches in training that
              will involve the formation of a team  mentoring group, 3) review current course
              offerings for those  preparing to be teachers, and 4) enhance the participation
              of  science faculty through workshops.  ***
