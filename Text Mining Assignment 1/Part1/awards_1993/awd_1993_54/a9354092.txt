                Proposal No.  ESIE 9354092  Proposal Name:  PLANNING PROPOSAL FOR
              SCHOOL/SCIENCE CENTER                  PARTNERSHIPS INITIATIVE  PI:  Judith
              Vecchione                                ABSTRACT    The Association of Science
              Technology Centers (ASTC) will plan a  multi-year initiative to build the
              capacity of science to  facilitate the implementation of school/science center 
              partnerships.  ASTC'S intention is to organize a network a  "learning
              communities" in five prominent interest areas, identified  by the field, to
              help science museums focus more effectively on  school science education, and
              develop close collaboration with  schools to influence systemic change.   
              During the planning phase, ASTC will:       Organize and convene a national
              advisory committee       Develop a position paper to inform and engage the
              field for         school/science center collaboration.       Identify
              leadership institutions and their partners among school      systems, and form
              a core group of facilities and personnel for      the leaning communities.     
               Investigate needs in existing practices and develop an             
              appropriate range of resources, services, and activities.       Determine
              priorities for phased implementation of learning          communities and
              related program activities.       Conduct research to identify useful
              techniques and approaches       for program documentation, research, and
              evaluation.
