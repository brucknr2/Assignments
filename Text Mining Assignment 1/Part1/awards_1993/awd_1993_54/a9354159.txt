Abstract    :
              9354159  DeLoatch  Morgan State University proposes to again coordinate student 
              component of the NSF second National Conference on Diversity in the  Scientific
              and Technological Workforce, which is scheduled in  Washington, DC on October
              28-30, 1993.  The conference will focus  attention on the Foundation's role in
              the education of minorities  who are underrepresented in science, engineering
              and mathematics  (SEM) fields.  Conference activities will include research 
              presentations by more than 300 student participants in NSF-  sponsored research
              projects, and hearings on major issues  identified in the 1992 conference
              Action Plan.  The university  would prepare an abstract of student
              presentations, and design and  schedule activities to encourage student
              interactions with role  models and other minority SEM students, leading to the
              formation of  a support group to reinforce student selection of SEM majors and 
              careers.  Grant activities also would include scheduling student  travel and
              hotel accommodations, and arranging transportation to  the conference for local
              area precollege and college students.
