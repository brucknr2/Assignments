Abstract    :
              9354913  Devries    Machine tools drove America's industrial preeminence in the
              world  and were also a major driving force in mechanical enginering.   Today,
              the United States is no longer as strong in machine tools as  in the past. 
              Mechatronics, as an engineering discipline, is the  synergistic combination of
              mechanical enginering, electronics,  control engineering, and computer science.
               The key element in  mechatronics is the integration of these areas through the
              design  process.  We propose to use five NSF graduate research traineeships  to
              foster the incorporation of mechatronic design principles into  five important
              disciplinary research areas we have identified, and  in which the Department of
              Mechanical Engineering at Rensselaer has  technical strength and expertise. 
              Each of these technical areas is  critical to machine tools and will add value,
              reliability and  accuracy to new designs.  As a result, we can offer our
              trainees a  unique and broad research experience that can focus on the needs of
               the machine tools industry and machine tool users.  ***
