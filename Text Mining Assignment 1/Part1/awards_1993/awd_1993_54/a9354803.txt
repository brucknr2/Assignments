Abstract    :
              9354803  Plumb    This curriculum development project will enable Jamestown 
              Community College and (through dissemination activities) other  two-year
              colleges to continue to move toward a heavily  observation-based approach to
              introductory physics, consistent  with the nature of physics as an
              observation-based discipline.  In the area of mechanics, there exists a growing
              body of  teaching methods and materials which emphasizes direct  observation
              and active student involvement. This project will  identify, study, pilot test
              and evaluate a variety of similar  approaches to the teaching of electricity
              and magnetism and  selected topics in modern physics. A notebook of successful 
              methods and materials will be a tangible outcome of our efforts  to help
              students develop a solid conceptual understanding of  topics in electricity and
              magnetism.
