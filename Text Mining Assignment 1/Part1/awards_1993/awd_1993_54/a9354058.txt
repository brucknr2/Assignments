Abstract    :
              9354058  Richardson  The United States will benefit significantly from this
              visit.  It  will permit:         (a)  New joint research projects to be
              created.       (b)  Allow renewal of previous collaborations with colleagues   
                      at the General Physics Institute.       (c)  Expose American scientists
              and students of Russian            facilities and technologies.       (d) 
              Strengthen our experimental and theoretical capabilities            in lasers
              and laser interaction science at CREOL.    The Russian scientists students and
              institutions will benefit from         (a)  Exposure American scientific and
              cultural environment       (b)  Support in maintaining their strengths in
              specific areas            of laser-matter interaction science.  ***
