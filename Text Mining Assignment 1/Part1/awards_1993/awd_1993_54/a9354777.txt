Abstract    :
              9354777  Alstad         I am the author of an instructional software package
              designed to  support university courses in ecology and evolutionary biology. 
              Development of my present version, Populus 3.0, was funded by  grants from IBM,
              the University of Minnesota, and the NSF. It has  proven to be an extremely
              successful pedagogical tool here at  Minnesota, and is currently in use at more
              than 350 institutions,  worldwide.  I request additional UCCD funding to pursue
              four major  objectives, including (1) improvement of the narrative text offered
               to explain Populus models both on screen and in a companion book,  (2)
              expanded coverage with new models, (3) "porting" of the package  to a new
              operating system, and (4) an initiative to increase the  use of Populus in
              small colleges. In addition to these new efforts,  I will continue to debug and
              maintain the program, and curate the  free distribution that will maximize its
              use.  ***y
