Abstract    :
              9354105  Klapper    The conference proposed is absolutely necessary if the
              Eisenhower  National Clearinghouse for Mathematics and Science Education is to 
              achieve its purpose of helping educators to locate all science and  mathematics
              instructional materials funded by Federal government.   There currently are
              databases created by government agencies such  as NASA, NIH, DC and ED.  All of
              them contain references to science  and mathematics instructional materials. 
              If the ultimate user is  to be served with a minimum of frustration, a one
              source inquiry is  required.  The Eisenhower National Clearinghouse wants to
              bring  together all the potential participants in a federation of  databases
              that would subscribe to standard protocols.  To the user  it appear that there
              is one source, rather that further references  that would require additional
              inquiries.  ***
