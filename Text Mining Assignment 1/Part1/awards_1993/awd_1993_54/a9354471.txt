Abstract    :
              9354471  McGowen                                  The project is a collaborative
              effort between two-year college and  four-year college and university faculty
              in the preparation of  curriculum materials, teacher supplements, and workshop
              materials  for a developmental algebra reform curriculum. In addition, the 
              project leaders are engaging in dissemination activities to  determine the
              effects of implementation of these materials. The  curriculum materials are
              designed to provide students with greater  mathematical literacy and a stronger
              foundation to bridge the gap  to calculus. The project is investigating the
              adaptability of  current calculus reform dissemination models for use in an
              algebra  reform curriculum.  They are also designing a model for evaluation  of
              student attitudes and performance in comparison with students  taking
              introductory and/or intermediate algebra in a traditional  setting, as well as
              an instrument to document pedagogical changes  in teachers trying to implement
              a non-traditional curriculum.  A  proposed outcome of the project is a model
              for implementing a  reform algebra curriculum and the establishment of a
              network of  two-year and four-year college developmental mathematics 
              implementers for a particular curriculum reform project.  ***y
