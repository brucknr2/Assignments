              Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Partnership for Science              
              and Engineering with the University of the Philippines in Manila.              
               This partnership will involve development of an                               
              Industry/University Cooperative Research Center in hazardous waste             
              management research; build educational and research linkages                   
              between the two institutions; include components of shared                     
              curriculum development; provide opportunities for students at                  
              participating Philippine academic institutions to enroll at NJIT;              
              and provide opportunities for Philippine faculty members to carry              
              out research and develop curricular partnerships with colleagues at            
              NJIT.
