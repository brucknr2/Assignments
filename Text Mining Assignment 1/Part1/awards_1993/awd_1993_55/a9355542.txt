              State University                       East Lansing, MI                        
              Connecting Teaching, Learning, and Assessment (CTLA)    This is a 4-year
              project to prepare 360 middle school  teachers at 10 sites around the country
              to implement the  Michigan State University Connected Mathematics Program 
              (CMP).  The project begins in Summer 1 with teams from 10  previously
              established CMP Centers attending a 2-week  residential leadership workshop at
              MSU.  Each team of 4 is  made up of well-prepared teachers, supervisors, and/or
               teacher educators with prior CMP (or CMP-like) experience.   To prepare these
              teams to assume leadership roles in  implementing CMP in its respective
              Center's region, this  workshop introduces the leaders to: (1) the new CMP
              units  (including the underlying mathematics and the built-in  technological
              software components); (2) the uses of oral and  written discourse in
              mathematics; (3) ways of establishing a  problem-solving environment in the
              classroom;  and (4)  authentic assessment in mathematics.  Over the next 2
              years,  each leadership team, in turn, prepares and supports 12 6th  grade
              teachers to implement the new materials and teaching  practices in their
              classrooms.  This support includes 2  intensive, sequential 2-week summer
              workshops, as well on-  going support for 2 school years.  Similar 2-year 
              implementation cycles for the 7th and 8th grade materials  begin with new
              groups of teachers in Years 2 and 3,  respectively.     Cost-sharing is 31% of
              the NSF contribution.
