Abstract    :
              9355760  Baumann    The Bay Beach Wildlife Sanctuary requests $58,414 from the
              Informal  Science Education Program of the National Science Foundation to 
              infuse an environmental education message with innovative  approaches to
              visitor self-instruction, through the two elements  which comprise our
              Communities and Connections in the World of  Nature project.  This $364,097
              project is an ambitious attempt to  introduce and involve BBWS visitors with
              the fascinating  interactions of life which hold all living communities
              together.   Fine and coarse grain examination of 11 ecological concepts (e.g., 
              habitat, human impacts, energy flow, etc.)  central to these  interactions is
              achieved through a creative blend of innovative  public programs, museum-style
              interactive exhibits, engaging  graphics and habitat-oriented live animal
              displays.    Specifically, NSF funding will allow BBWS to:    1)  Develop and
              conduct participatory educational programs (Jr.  Naturalist/ages 5-8, Jr.
              Ecologist/ages 9-12) that introduce  ecological themes and concepts to families
              and school groups.    2)  Develop and produce a 180 sq. ft. computer-based
              interact  exhibit (Habitat Puzzle) that encourages visitors to explore 
              ecological concepts of habitat composition in depth.
