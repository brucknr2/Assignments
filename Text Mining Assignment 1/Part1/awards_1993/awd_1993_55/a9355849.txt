Abstract    :
              9355849  Reddish    The project which was proposed originally was intended to
              study how  students' expectations affect their learning in a number of 
              specific cases.  The results are intended to lead to modification  of materials
              produced at the University of Washington which are  aimed at helping students
              articulate and explicate their views of  the process and content of science. 
              The project involved two  primary dynamic studies looking for student
              attitudes;and, the  other focused on factors influencing students'
              self-debugging  skills
