Abstract    :
              9355628  Epstein         This project by the Oregon Museum of Science and
              Industry  (OMSI) develops a public education program on chemistry.  The 
              program:         introduces students and the general public to the science of  
                  chemistry and processes of chemistry-related research       through drop-in
              lab activities;       provides follow-up chemistry activities for use by      
              elementary teachers and parents so that children can further       explore the
              interests they have developed in science and       chemistry;       provides
              opportunities for internships for high-school       students as lab assistants
              so that they can develop greater       knowledge of "everyday" chemistry,
              laboratory techniques and       safety, develop skills in working with others
              and in       teaching chemistry, and explore potential careers in      
              teaching chemistry; and       make available the resources developed by OMSI to
              other       interested science museums.  ***
