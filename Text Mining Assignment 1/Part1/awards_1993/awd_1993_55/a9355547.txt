Abstract    :
              9355547  Patterson    This project, supported at $1,931,632 is designed to
              provide  mathematics content and leadership training for two teachers from 
              each of the 87 elementary schools in the Cleveland Public Schools  over a
              four-year period, for a total of 82 days of enhancement per  teacher-leader. 
              Principals from all buildings will receive  information on math reform, staff
              preparation, and district  requests for staff support at the building level. 
              Each summer, the  lead teachers will receive additional preparation in
              mathematics  content, teaching of mathematics, and leadership skills.  During 
              each school year the lead teachers will meet monthly with project  trainers. 
              The project will provide annual seminars on awareness  and training for
              principals.  Parent representatives will receive  awareness and training for
              principals.  Parent representatives will  receive awareness sessions. 
              cost-sharing for the project is 9% the  NSF award.
