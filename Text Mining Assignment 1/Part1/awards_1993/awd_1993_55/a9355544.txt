Abstract    :
                9355544  Dale                                              Restructuring
              Mathematics     This 5-year project by Edmonds School District #19 builds on 
              district-financed project that began a fundamental, systemic,  district-wide
              reform of K-12 mathematics 3 years ago.  The pilot  project has already trained
              40 teacher-leaders and impacted over  500 teachers at all grade levels, and the
              present project builds on  this base.  It involves teachers, principals,
              administrators, and  parents to create a district-wide culture to support sound
               mathematics education for 20,000 students at 24 elementary, 4  middle, and 5
              high schools.  During its 5-year life, the project  will have directly impacted
              436 elementary, 24 middle school, and  34 high school teachers, including
              training 36 elementary, 8 middle  school, and 10 high school teacher-leaders. 
              The program for the  teachers consists of 5 sequential 1-week summer institutes
              plus 8  full days of follow-up during the school year, focusing on such 
              matters as:  restructuring the teacher's own conception of  mathematics;
              creating collaborative learning environments in the  classroom; alternative
              assessment; a study of modern curricula;  etc.  There are also programs for
              parents (6 evening sessions) and  administrators, including 33 building
              principals.       Cost-sharing is 104% of the NSF contribution.
