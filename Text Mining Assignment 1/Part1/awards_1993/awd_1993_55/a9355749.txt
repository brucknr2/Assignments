Abstract    :
              9355749  McHone    The teaching of science requires experiences that many
              teachers  have not obtained from their undergraduate and continuing 
              education's.  One of the most effective methods centers on outdoor  field
              activities, both local and off-school, in which students  learn science as
              observation and interpretation rather than as a  collection of facts.  We
              propose a Field Science Institute for  Teachers, in which K-12 teachers
              increase their basic knowledge and  appreciation of science topics that are
              appropriate for field  study, using classroom work and field work at suitable
              localities.    The grant allows 40 teachers to participate in the Field Science
               Institute during each of the 1994 and 1995 summer semesters at  Wesleyan
              University, within the Graduate Liberal Studies Program.   The Institute will
              be conducted as four concurrent academic courses  and seminars during four-week
              sessions in July of 1994 and July of  1995.  Courses will be in subject areas
              of Field Botany, Field  Geology, Field Zoology (Ecology), and Field
              Archaeology, plus a  seminar in curriculum design for all participants. 
              Graduate  credits can be applied toward a Master of Arts in Liberal Studies  or
              a Certificate of Advanced Study, and school districts may also  award CEU's.
