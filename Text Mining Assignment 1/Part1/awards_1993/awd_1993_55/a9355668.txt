Abstract    :
              9355668  Brittain    This is a three-year project to work comprehensively with
              72  elementary schools over the next three years -- providing each with  one
              year of intensive site-based training focused on Using the  Outdoors to Teach
              Experiential Science (UTOTES).  Over the three  rears, approximately 1000
              teachers will have been reached.  Each  school will select 16-24 teachers to
              participate in six site-based  training sessions -- with the principal and one
              or more community  resource persons also participating.  During these sessions,
              the  following will be the main emphasis:    (1)  Teachers learn how the
              natural world can be used to motivate  and teach children and how to use school
              grounds to develop  curriculum and support the teaching of hands-on life, and
              physical  science.    (2)  Teachers learn how to use the interdisciplinary
              nature of  science to assist teaching in other subject areas, and    (3)  The
              principal/community leaders learn the value of school site  improvements --
              through projects such as butterfly gardens,  miniponds, and bird
              feeding/observation stations.    Comprehensive team-building forms a local
              "critical mass" of effort  for "hands-on" teaching, with UTOTES giving teachers
              the confidence  and know-how to take students outdoors and to also bring nature
               into the classroom for a myriad of instructional purposes.    The project
              requested $718,793 from NSF with institutions/agencies  and school districts
              providing 107% of the National Science  Foundation in cost sharing.
