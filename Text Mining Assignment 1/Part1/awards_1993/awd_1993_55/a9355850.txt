Abstract    :
              9355850  Lehrer    This project is to study how students develop model-based 
              reasoning.  The context is to study students in the context  planning and
              constructing inventions based on LEGO LOGO.  However,  the main study will be
              to diagnose student understanding of  functional simple machines, understand
              how knowledge about simple  machines developed in various pedagogical contexts.
               Included will  be teacher-developed design-based instructional units to foster
               model-based reasoning and investigation of the notions that  students invent
              and use in design contexts.  A computer assisted  design and simulation tool
              will be developed.  ***
