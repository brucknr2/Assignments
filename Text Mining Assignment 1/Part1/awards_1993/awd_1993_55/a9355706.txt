Abstract    :
              9355706     Meisner   University of North Carolina at Greensboro    Technology
              Tools for Science and Mathematics Learning    The UNC Greensboro, in
              cooperation with nine other universities,  provides summer workshops on the
              uses of technology and follow up  support for teachers from twenty school
              systems in the state.  In  collaboration with universities, other education
              agencies, and all  state school systems, 230 inservice and 170 preservice
              teachers are  trained to use the current technologies that are available as
              tools  to enhance science and mathematics learning.  Teachers from 135  schools
              each participate in a two-year enhancement program, meeting  for two weeks each
              of the two summers and 12 additional days during  the school year.  Topics
              include computer software, data probes,  data storage, and telecomputing. 
              E-mail and database support are  provided through the state system for teachers
              known as NEWTON.    The summer workshops are organized with the mornings
              dedicated to  the teachers learning the tools and the afternoon to hands-on
              work  with the technology.  The staggered plan, the multiple settings,  and the
              supporting communications technologies enable teachers to  work with their
              peers throughout the school year.     Cost sharing is estimated at 109%.  ***
