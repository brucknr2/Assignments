Abstract    :
              9355117  Marks         We seek support for a consortial graduate program between
               Cornell University and the Institute of Ecosystem Studies, a 
              nondegree-granting institution.  The focus of the program is 
              "human-accelerated environmental change."  Our program will expose  doctoral
              students to problems of human-accelerated environmental  change and their
              potential solutions, and encourage cross-  disciplinary collaborative research
              while retaining strong,  flexible training in ecological research.  We will
              accomplish these  goals through a mix of traditional and novel programs,
              including  coursework and seminars, apprenticeships with environmental 
              management agencies, and an annual long-term monitoring exercise.   In
              addition, students in the program will be exposed to the policy  and management
              implications of ecological research.  Students will  be encouraged to work on
              the "big problems" of environmental  change, but at scales suitable for
              doctoral research.         The program will create a community of bright,
              concerned  students in a supportive atmosphere in which to pursue thesis 
              research on important environmental question.  By both formalizing  and
              expanding on the goodwill and the many existing interactions  between Cornell
              and the Institute of Ecosystem Studies, the  proposed consortial arrangement
              offers an exceptional opportunity  for a new group of graduate students to work
              in a nationally  important area of science.    ***
