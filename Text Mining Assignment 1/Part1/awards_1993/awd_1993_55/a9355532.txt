Abstract    :
              9355532  Baxter         Integrating Science Concepts enhances the scientific
              literacy and teaching of K-  8 teachers in Eugene School District 4J.  Teachers
              develop skills in creating and  presenting constructivist, activity-based
              instruction that integrates science with other  disciplines.  The first year 16
              master teachers participate in a 15 day summer  workshop with project staff,
              Willamette Science and Technology Center and Oregon  State University experts
              in pedagogy, and University of Oregon scientists.  In the  following years
              these master teachers and project staff work with an additional 72  mentor
              teachers to develop the skills and knowledge to teach peers.          Workshop
              activities include hands-on scientific investigations focusing on  particular
              science concepts, critical analysis of exemplary concept-based science 
              curricula, and participants' design of concept-based science units to use in
              classrooms.   Regularly scheduled follow-up sessions support teachers in
              implementing these units.
