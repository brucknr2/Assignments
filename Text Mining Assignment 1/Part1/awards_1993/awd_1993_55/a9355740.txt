Abstract    :
              9355740  Ponzio         The Youth Experiences in Science (YES) Project of the
              4-H  Center at UC, Davis will produce, pilot and evaluate an informal  science
              education curriculum expressly designed for 5-9 year olds  in school-age child
              care (SACC) settings.  Seven thematic units  will be developed (three in both
              English and Spanish versions),  utilizing the basic design process and
              instructional model  developed in the earlier SERIES Project.  Each unit
              consists of  engaging hands-on activities performed with inexpensive materials 
              and incorporating home and neighborhood service applications.          During
              the three years approximately 500 teenage volunteers  will deliver the program
              to approximately 2,500 children through  a network of existing SACC sites
              operated by 4-H and other  community groups.  Capitalizing on SACC settings,
              the program  will collaborate with schools and reach out to parents through 
              development of "Science Family Backpacks" and "Science Family  Activity
              Nights."         Program evaluation includes in-depth monitoring and use of 
              multiple assessment instruments and measures at 25 selected  sites.  In
              addition to formative and summative evaluation, data  will be available on
              parent involvement and the amount, nature,  and durability of positive
              influences on participants' school  science interest and success.  ***
