              Florida              Jacksonville,  FL.                          Technology,
              Discovery, and Communication in Secondary School  Mathematics    This 2-year
              project features two cycles of a 1-year professional  development program,
              reaching a total of 52 in-service mathematics  teachers and 8
              graduate/undergraduate students in mathematics  education at the University of
              North Florida.  The programs focuses  on preparing the participants to
              introduce: (1) classroom uses of  computers and graphing calculators; (2)
              learning through discovery,  problem-solving, and group effort; and (3) writing
              as an essential  part of the mathematics curriculum.  Each program consists of:
               (Summer 1) a 4-week summer institute focusing on Algebra/Pre- 
              Calculus/Calculus; (School Year) monthly meetings to discuss  classroom
              implementation of new lessons and teaching techniques,  critique samples of
              student work, etc.;  (Summer 2) an institute  focusing on General Math/Algebra
              I/Geometry.  Three participants  from the first-year program are selected to
              serve as adjunct  instructors for the second program cycle.  The 52 teachers 
              particpating in the program are expected to impact some 200  additional
              teachers in their home schools and districts; the  student participants are
              expected to use the experience as a basis  for dissertations and/or research
              papers.     Cost sharing is 30% of the NSF contribution.
