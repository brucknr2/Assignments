Abstract    :
                Advances in computational mathematics have revolutionized the  variety and the
              nature of problems that can be addressed by  environmental scientists and
              engineers.  To fully exploit these  advances, we must develop students who have
              computational as well  as environmental domain expertise.  We propose  a
              training  program  emphasizing graduate study of advanced computational 
              techniques applied to complex problems in environmental science  and
              engineering.  The focal point of this program is  computational environmental
              science and engineering will be a  radically different approach to the solution
              of complex  engineering problems:  multi-disciplinary optimization (MDO).   MDO
              is founded on advances in numerical optimization, parallel  computation, and
              information technology for collaborate work.   MDO will allow environmental
              scientists and engineers to  collaborate within the context of one or more
              objectives that  apply to the project as a whole, but that may be unattainable
              or  unclear within the context of each subtask.  This capability is  critical
              to the resolution of environmental problems which are  typically
              multidisciplinary and multiobjective.    The training program will draw on
              faculty in the departments of  Environmental Science and Engineering. 
              Computational and Applied  Mathematics, Computer Science, and Statistics. 
              These departments  have a substantial history of cooperation and the faculty 
              involved in the program are internationally recognized as leaders  in their
              respective areas.
