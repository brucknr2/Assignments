Abstract    :
              9355018  Bajcsy    The proposed program is focused on research and education
              relating  to the fundamental scientific issues underlying the coordination of 
              multiple robotic agents for manipulating and transporting objects  with limited
              assistance from human agents.  We argue that the  narrow specialization of the
              PhD does not always serve the needs of  education and engineering today.  We
              propose an integrated approach  to research which fosters multi-faculty-student
              interaction.  In  this approach several faculty and students from different 
              backgrounds, but with common goals, collaboratively pursue a  research agenda
              which requires the collective expertise of the  group.  The interdisciplinary
              GRASP Laboratory with faculty and  students from four different engineering
              departments is uniquely  qualified to train PhD students in the focus area and
              provide them  with the breadth and depth that is required in today's high 
              technology society.  We request five traineeships for the  laboratory.  ***
