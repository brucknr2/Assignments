Abstract    :
              9355557  Lake    This is a five-year project to enable 100 teachers from
              Wisconsin  to learn and be involved in scientific research.  The plan is to 
              have teachers involved in staff development activities of at least  five days
              and then to actively been involved in up to 30 days of  hands-on scientific
              research.  This research will be (a) on an  individual basis under the
              mentorship of specifically selected  scientists, or (b) within a team, or (c)
              both.  The team projects  will be (a) an examination of water quality using
              biotic indexing,  and (b) trails aimed at the effective use of milkweed as an 
              indicator of ozone pollution.  Both team projects will be in  collaboration
              with the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources.    The project's goals
              include (1) improvement of the teaching of  science by enabling selected
              teachers to become experienced in  scientific research, (2) formation of
              partnerships with scientists  for on-going mentorship, (3) performance of
              valuable studies and  (4) providing selected with the local opportunity to be
              research  assistants in a research project.    The project has its foundations
              in Field Involvement: Research by  Science Teachers (FIRST), an NSF-funded
              program.  This proposal  benefits from the lessons learned from FIRST, the
              expertise it  created amongst teachers, and the weaknesses that became
              apparent.   The project also benefits from the experience gained, especially in
               terms of the leadership, pedagogy, and networking components, from  Earth
              Science Resource Associates (ESRA), a currently NSF-funded  project of the
              Wisconsin Academy.    The project requested $743,745 from NSF with
              institutions/Agencies  and school districts providing $172,841% of the National
              Science  Foundation portion in cost sharing (this does not include 
              miscellaneous supplies, space, phone, contributed by school  districts).
