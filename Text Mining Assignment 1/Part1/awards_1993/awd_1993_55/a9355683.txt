Abstract    :
              9355683     Cristini  Ramapo College of New Jersey  Revitalizing Science
              Teaching Using Remote Sensing  Technologies (RST)2    This project works with
              180 teachers and 30 supervisors from  90 schools in the New York, New Jersey
              area on incorporating  remote sensing data and techniques into their science 
              classrooms.  The classes targeted are grades 4-5 and most  topics specifically
              relate to earth science.  Teachers  receive instruction in the science and
              mathematics content  needed to use real and timely data and to analyze images. 
               The approach includes collegial teams with shared tasks.   Communication among
              the teachers is encouraged and teachers  share their work and resources over
              the Internet.    Cost sharing is estimated at 13%.  ***
