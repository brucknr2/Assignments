Abstract    :
              9355610  Silevitch    The Center for the Enhancement of Science and Mathematics
              Education  (CESAME) proposes an initiative to provide long term support for 
              the dissemination and implementation of exemplary curricular,  teacher
              enhancement and other science and mathematics education  reform projects.  Over
              a 5 year period the CESAME Statewide  Implementation Program (SIP) will
              establish thirteen exemplary  projects in at least 50 schools across
              Massachusetts.  This will  involve a critical mass of both teachers and
              administrators at each  site.    In the pilot year two schools will
              participate, two more will be  added in '94-'95 and three more schools will be
              selected as test  sites for addition to the group in '95-'96.  After the first
              two  years of adding two test sites per year, 3 test sites per year will  be
              added.  After a school has been a test site for two years, its  program will
              expand to include 4 demonstration schools associated  with that site. 
              Therefore in '95-'96 4 demonstration sites will  join each of the first two
              pilot schools, in '96-'97 4  demonstration sites will join each of the test
              sites initiated in  '94-'95 and so on.  By the fourth year of the program
              ('96-'97)  there will be 2+2+3+3 test sites and 16 demonstrations sites in 
              all.  Each year sites will be added until '98-'99 when there will  be 13 test
              sites and 40 demonstration sites in all.  Those schools  that begin the project
              in '93-'94 and their demonstration sites  will all become sites of exemplary
              practice by the end of NSF  funding.    Funding is requested for a five year
              period, to follow a pilot year  funded by the CESAME partners and the Noyce
              Foundation.  The amount  of the request is $4,403,823 with cost share of
              $2.480,064.
