Abstract    :
              9355540  Scahill    This three year project is to provide training in micro- and
              macro-economics over two, four week summer workshops (1995, 1996) for 25
              teachers selected from the state of Pennsylvania. The project will be located
              on the University of Scranton campus and will begin during the summer of 1995.
              These newly trained teachers then become important parts of the resource for
              the nine centers for economic education at various colleges and universities
              across Pennsylvania. The newly enhanced teachers will in turn provide at least
              100 hours of inservice work for an additional 500 teachers during the second
              and third year of the project in conjunction with the Centers.  The newly
              enhanced teachers will assist in teaching using a video course called
              "Economics USE" produced by the Annenberg Foundation.  An additional
              traditional course will fill out the requisite minimum of 100 hours of
              training.  The outreach activity will begin during the second year of the
              project and will extend through the third year. The participants will meet at a
              regional meeting at least once each year to discuss  their courses and share
              their experiences.
