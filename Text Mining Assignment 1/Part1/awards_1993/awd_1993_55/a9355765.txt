Abstract    :
              9355765  Woods                                The project will purchase diode
              array spectrophotometers to measure  rapid kinetics in the undergraduate
              biochemistry course. New  experiments will be centered about enzymatic kinetics
              with data  collection required at less than second intervals.  The rates of 
              formation and degradation of reactants, intermediates, and products  will be
              determined.
