Abstract    :
              GET REAL         The Get Real! science strand will model and reinforce positive 
              attitudes towards,and involve in, science and technology.  It will  seek to
              affirm for children the value of their ideas, and the  importance of asking
              Why?         It will tell stories about kids involved in science-related 
              activities (such as science camps, inventors' fairs and wildlife 
              rehabilitation programs), and connect science concepts to  children's known
              experiences and activities.  These ideas are basic  to constructivism-that
              people grow based on what they already  understand, adding levels of
              knowledge-and are central to Get Real!      It will enforce viewers' active
              connection to the science content  by making suggestions for projects to get
              involved with, and by  encouraging children to discuss and question their
              knowledge of  science and the world around them.  We will also direct students
              to  appropriate informal science education organizations (such as  science
              centers and zoos) and to their teachers, for further  discussion and
              information. (Teachers guides will be developed as  part of this project.)  ***
