Abstract    :
              9355468  Hofmann    This project is a two-day conference, January 28-29, 1994,
              on the  use of graphing calculators for 200 middle and high school  mathematics
              and science teachers with additional post-secondary  participation.  The
              conference will be held at Montgomery Community  College, Blue Bell, PA and
              service participants from that area.   Participants will receive a conference
              proceedings and must commit  to part of an e-mail network with regular
              contributions coming from  conference leaders, participants and technical
              support staff.     The Conference will provide a graphing calculator to the 200
               participants, and a project kit for each school from which teachers  attend. 
              Texas Instruments, Inc. has made the calculators and  projector kits available
              to the conference project at discount  prices.  Participation in the conference
              requires a signed  agreement of understanding from the teacher and building
              principal  to provide local access to the network and regular contributions by 
              the teacher.    The project evaluation will be carried out through participant 
              questionnaires at the completion of the conference, after 0.5  years, and after
              1 year.  These will focus on the value of the  conference in involving the
              teacher's involvement of participants  in using technology in their
              instruction.  A log of e-mail use will  be studied in relation to getting
              teachers into electronic dialog.  ***
