Abstract    :
              9355630  Murphy    The Exploratorium proposes to develop, publish, and
              distribute  nationally a Family Science Snackbook, a collection of up to 36 
              hands-on science activities, for use by parents/caregivers with  their
              children, age 11 and under.  The Family Science Snackbook,  building on the
              Exploratorium's successful Science Snackbook for  teachers, will serve the
              needs of parents/caregivers who lack a  background in science but wish to
              experiment and learn with their  children.  It will link experiments to
              everyday activities, such as  cooking, cleaning, watching the rain, or driving
              a car.  The  Exploratorium will develop the book with the direct input of more 
              than 375 family members and educators from community groups.   Through this
              broad-based research with families and community  groups, the Exploratorium
              will be able to experiment with form,  design, and content, and to assure that
              the final product serves an  ethnically diverse, multigenerational audience. 
              The research  process will also put focus on girls.
