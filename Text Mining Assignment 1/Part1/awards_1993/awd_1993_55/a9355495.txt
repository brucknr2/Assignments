Abstract    :
              9355495  Jensen  Evidence has been obtained that L-phenylalanine is formed in 
              several spatial compartments in higher plant cells (Jensen, USA).   Secondary
              metabolism converts phenylalanine to lignin precursors  via enzymes which are
              spatially sequestered as well (Osipov,  Russia).  The coordinated regulation of
              these enzyme systems and  mechanism for integrating the overall network will be
              studied.  ***
