Abstract    :
              9355465  Hoffman    The National Research Council (NRC) through its Coordinating
               Council for Education requests $800,000 to support the NRCs work on 
              development of national science teaching and assessment standards.   Work to
              date has focussed on the curriculum standards work.  But  work on the teaching
              and assessment portions of the project must be  accelerated if an integrated
              draft of the science standards is to  be published and disseminated by late
              fall of 1993.    ***
