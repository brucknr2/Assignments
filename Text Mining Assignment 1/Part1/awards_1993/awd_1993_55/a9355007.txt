Abstract    :
                High performance computing (HPC) is a major initiative at  Louisiana State
              University (LSU).  Its multidisciplinary research  programs focus on grand
              challenges in materials science,  astronomy, microsystems design, and
              environmental studies.  To  advance this effort, we request five NSF
              Traineeships.    Consortial arrangements have been made to recruit in-state and
               out-of-state students, especially minorities from Historically  Black
              Institutions.  Innovative training structures have been  introduced to
              integrate HPC into graduate education and research.   These include new
              cross-disciplinary curricula and a dual-degree  program to allow Ph.D. students
              in the physical sciences to get a  M.S. from Computer Science and vice versa. 
              Unique opportunities  are available for graduate trainees to interact with
              scientists  at Oak Ridge and Argonne National Laboratories, Mobil and Ethyl 
              Corporations, and in Europe and Japan.    To establish the HPC effort a LSU,
              two excellent parallel  computing laboratories have been set up with $2.
              million in  infrastructure grants from the State of Louisiana.  These 
              laboratories feature an 8,192-node MasPar, a 64-cell iWarp, and  8-node
              iPSC/860, and an 8-processor Silicon Graphics.  With the  latest grant of
              $850,000, we plan to acquire a 56-node Intel  Paragon.
