Abstract    :
              The Georgia Institute of Technology's School of Physics will host  the eighth
              National Conference of Black Physics Students (NCBPS) in  February 1994. 
              NCBPS'94 will be the continuation of a sequence of  such annual conferences
              that began in 1987.  The motivation for the  NCBPS is to assist and encourage
              those African-American students  who have shown interest and ability in physics
              to enter and  complete Ph.D. programs, and to initiate research and teaching 
              careers in Physics.  The idea for this conference series originated  with a
              group of African-American physics graduate students at MIT.   The conferences
              have been organized and implemented by students  (with faculty and staff
              assistance) at various host institutions  throughout the country.      The core
              information of the conference is transmitted through (1)  lectures by
              distinguished scientists and engineers, (2) technical  presentations by current
              Black graduate and undergraduate students,  (3) workshops on the graduate
              admission process, (4) seminars on  graduate financial aid, and (5) forums on
              successfully completing  a graduate program in Physics.    The primary audience
              for the conference consists of undergraduate  students who are majoring in
              physics, or who have expressed a  genuine interest in the subject.  A principal
              goal of the  conference is to permit these students, who are in the process of 
              making career decisions that will shape the course of their working  lives, to
              meet and interact with Black graduate students, and Black  scientists who can
              serve as mentors and role models.***
