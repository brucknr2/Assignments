Abstract    :
              9355826  Dugger    Standards for technology education are needed to complement
              the national standards in mathematics and science.  The first phase of the
              project is to articulate a rationale and structure for technology education - a
              vision for the intellectual domain for technology education and its interface
              with science and mathematics.  The International Technology Education
              Association (ITEA) develops the document and the processes for evaluating it to
              gain consensus and acceptance by the technology education community and other
              constituencies.  An Advisory Board of people with national reputations in
              various fields oversees the process.
