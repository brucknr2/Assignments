Abstract    :
              9355620  Stewart    This 3-year project provides intensive training and academic
              year  support for a cadre of 40 leader elementary and middle school  teachers
              from four districts in northwestern Washington State.   With training in
              Operation Physics materials, leadership training  and continuing project and
              district support these teachers will  provide comprehensive training and
              collegial support for  essentially every other K-6 teacher in these districts. 
              The leader  or Level-2 teachers will receive 50 days of training each year in 
              summer workshops, academic year workshops and scientific research  experiences.
               Workshops for their peers, Level-3 teachers, will be  for two weeks in the
              summers.  Unusual features of the Washington  State-Op are:  university faculty
              from the sciences, mathematics  English and Technology will provide summer
              instruction and academic  year consultation to the leader teachers, there is
              substantial  support for the leader teachers in the form of teacher release
              time  for the leader teachers, the extent to which an outside evaluator  will
              track the project, and the extent to which the entire project  design has been
              driven by teachers.  Level-2 teachers will earn 36  graduate credits applicable
              to a Masters degree in Natural Science.   Level-3 teachers may earn 3-graduate
              credits for each summer with  AY follow-up.
