Abstract    :
              9355655  McGonigle    This is a three-year pilot project that will provide 48
              middle-  school teachers training in biological and environment sciences who 
              in turn will provide in-service training to approximately 528  teachers.  This
              two-part project will (1) enrich the biological and  environmental science
              background of teachers through Summer  Institutes presented by Academy research
              scientists and museum  educators; and (2) produce written curriculum materials
              and  classroom/field kits.  The project requested $234,972 from NSF with 
              institutions/agencies and school districts providing 33% in cost  sharing.
