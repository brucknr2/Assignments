Abstract    :
              9355861  Harel    The project has the potential to break new empirical and 
              theoretical ground and further our understanding of what it means  to
              understand mathematical proof  and how that understanding  develops.  The
              knowledge gained from this study has the potential  to impact significantly the
              way preservice teachers are trained to  teach proof and ultimately how
              mathematics and mathematical proofs  will be taught/learned in the school and
              college setting.  ***
