              Association for the Advancement of Science  (AAAS) will produce and distribute
              a half-hour science adventure  show for weekly broadcast, primarily on
              commercial children's  radio stations.  The series, "The Kinetic City Super
              Crew," is  targeted at children 8-10 years old with an emphasis on urban 
              children, girls, minorities, and children with disabilities.  The  series of 92
              programs also will be designed for family listening.   The programs revolve
              around a drama led by child actors and  include discussions with scientists and
              information for at-home  experiments.         The Co-Principal Investigators
              will be Jerry Bell and Gerald  Wheeler.  Bell is Program Director for Science,
              Mathematics, and  Technology Education at AAAS and will be responsible for
              overall  management of the project.  Wheeler is Program Director for the 
              Public Understanding of Science and Technology and will serve as  the Science
              Content Director for the programs.  There also will  be a Science Content Team
              (consisting of Bell, Shirley Malcom and  Andrew Ahlgren) that will work closely
              with Wheeler, the  production staff, and the advisors to review show themes, 
              scientists to be interviewed, overall content, and to serve as  arbiters for
              questions related to their respective fields.  Bob  Hirshon will serve as
              Executive Produce/Project Director and John  Keefe will be Senior Producer.
