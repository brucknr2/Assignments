              PI: Ronni Denes                                ABSTRACT         NACME will
              produce a three year public service advertising  campaign designed to shape the
              educational choices children make in  junior high and high school with respect
              to mathematics and  science.  The ads, featuring actor/director Spike Lee, will
              aim to  increase the number of children in grades three through eight who 
              understand the relevance and value of mathematics and science to  life in the
              adult world.  The campaign also will be directed  towards parents with the goal
              of helping them recognize the  importance of learning mathematics and science
              to their children's  future.  The components of the project will be:         o 
              For each of the three years of the project, development and         
              distribution of one 60, one 30, and one 10 second          television spot.    
                  o  For each of the three years of the project, development and         
              distribution of three 60, three 30, and three 10 second          radio spots.  
                    o  Annual development of print ads and marketing materials to          be
              delivered to selected consumer magazines, educator's          publications,
              in-school magazines, newspaper "kid pages,"          comic book companies, and
              bus shelter and transit card          carriers.         o  Annual development
              and distribution of 100,000 full-color          student brochures to reinforce
              the concepts outlined in the          campaign.         o  Annual development
              and distribution of 100,000 brochures          for parents to engage them in
              their children's science and          mathematics education.         o 
              Establishment of a toll-free 800 number for students to          call to
              request information.  Each caller will be sent both          the student and
              the parent brochure.         o  Development of promotional materials including
              buttons,          games, science experiments, math puzzles, T-shirts, etc.     
                  o  Annua l public relations campaigns including press          conferences,
              media tours, in-school demonstrations, and          personal appearances.

              fulfillment of requests received via the 800 number.         Development,
              production, and distribution of the campaign will  be the responsibility of a
