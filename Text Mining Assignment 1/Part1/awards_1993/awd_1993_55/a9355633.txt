              "SOUNDPRINT"  PI: Moira Rankin                                ABSTRACT         
                                             The SOUNDPRINT Media Center is producing a
              series of radio  documentaries entitled "Science and Technology on SOUNDPRINT,"
              a  set of related educational and outreach materials, and multimedia 
              non-broadcast applications.  The project will include 16 original  science
              documentaries and 21 programs repackaged as special  broadcasts distributed to
              over 200 public radio stations in the  United States, reaching over 750,000
              listeners, and ten countries  around the world.  The programs also will be
              distributed on  Internet Talk Radio.              The 16 new Programs will be
              grouped around three themes:  "The Butterfly Effect" which will bring large
              scientific concepts  describing global change to a more human level,
              "Technology and  Culture" which will consider the implications of technology,
              and  "The Consequences of Science" which will look at the broad  implications
              of scientific research.  The Executive Producer for  the project is Moira
              Rankin.  Neenah Ellis will serve as Senior  Producer and will work directly
              with independent producers in  story and script development.  The Science
              Editors will be Ann  Finkbeiner, a freelance science writer, and Barbara
              Culliton,  Deputy Editor of "Nature."
