Abstract    :
              9355127  Armaly    In this proposal, a five member machine tool research group
              of the  Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering and Engineering 
              Mechanics at the University of Missouri-Rolla (UMR) is requesting  funding to
              support five NSF traineeship positions per year over  five years in the area of
              machine tool research.  The NSF funding  will help to attract capable students,
              including minorities and  women, into the program.  Brief discussions of the
              identified five  major research projects are given.  Opportunities for the
              trainees  to interact with the Machine Tool Development Group at Lawrence 
              LIvermore National Laboratory and Cincinnati Milacron, through  Cincinnati
              Milacron Midwestern Regional Technical Center, have been  established.  ***
