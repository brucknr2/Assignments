Abstract    :
              9355581  Kuerbis         The Colorado College-Integrated Science Teacher 
              Enhancement Program (CC-ISTEP) is a comprehensive teacher  enhancement effort
              that also supports a new graduate degree  for teachers.          The objectives
              of CC-ISTEP include:     Bring together Colorado College faculty and local    
              educators to design theme-based institutes.     Establish a network of faculty
              and regional educators to     support the improvement of science teaching and
              learning     in k-8 settings.     Improve the teacher-participants'
              understanding of     science and use teacher development principles to ensure  
                long-term changes in pedagogical skills.     Use CC-ISTEP as a model for
              teacher development at other     colleges.         Over four years, Colorado
              College faculty and local  educators plan and implement theme-based, six week
              summer  institutes.  Participants are Colorado (or adjacent) K-8  teachers. 
              Follow-up academic year seminars support the  implementation efforts of the
              teachers.  Dissemination  conferences, open to ten national teams are held in
              the  third and fourth summers.
