Abstract    :
              9355857  Lewis    The proposal reflects a rich conceptual underpinning that
              suits the  embedded cases study approach to be used.  The goals and 
              justification of the study are well conceived and should yield a  contextually
              rich substantive and well-interpreted report.  The  research design is creative
              and has important implications for  several audiences in the United States. 
              The project's design will  make it possible to sample a broad range of
              interventions such as  notional schools and their role in teacher development,
              teacher  study groups, research networks, etc.
