Abstract    :
              9355523  Sarquis    This project will build upon Teaching Science with TOYS. 
              Through  TOYS over 475 K-12 teachers nationwide have brought toy based  science
              into their classrooms using nearly 100 activities.  TOYS:  CAPS will  1. 
              Actively cultivate district level systemic implementation of  toy based
              physical science education.  There will be 180  participants over 4 summers. 
              Teams of 2-3 teachers and one  administrator will participate in a 3-week
              summer workshop which  includes working directly with students in a summer
              camp.  Academic  year follow up will include fall and spring sessions either at
              the  Miami University host site or a regional University Affiliate site  where
              participants will report on activities share sessions and  exchange ideas.  In
              service workshops will be held with the  tecnical support being provided by
              TOYS staff and/or University  Affiliates.  2.  Over a three year period 18 TOYS
              graduates per year will  undergo extensive 'training' to enhance their
              pedagogical content  knowledge and develop leadership skills to become district
              Leaders.   This program will overlap with the Teacher/Administrator Program 
              (TAP) in which teams of 36 under prepared teachers (grades K-9) and 
              administrators will attend programs run by the TOYS leaders and  faculty.  3. 
              University Affiliates (two college or university science or  faculty members
              per summer) will participate to replicate the  program regionally to create
              TOYS centers throughout the US and to  implement hands on TOY based activities
              in local schools.   University Affiliates also include toy-based activities in
              their  pre-service science education courses.  4.  Through the
              Teacher/Researcher Program 12 peer writers per year  will work with TOYS
              faculty to research, develop and test  activiites and teacher resource modules.
               In TOYS: CAPS 378 teachers representing 66 district teams and six  university
              affiliates will directly participate over the 41 months  of the project.  An
              estimated 3,000 additional teachers will be  r eached through in-service and
              other outreach activities.  It is to  be noted that academic year programming
              will focus on regional  teams within commuting distance and summer programming
              will target  a national audience.
