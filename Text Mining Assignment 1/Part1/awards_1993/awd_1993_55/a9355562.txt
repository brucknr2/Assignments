                  PROPOSAL NUMBER: ESI-9355562    PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR:  Dr. John Moore   
              INSTITUTION:  The University of Wisconsin, Madison    TITLE:  Chemistry
              Fundamentals for Middle School Teachers;  Maintaining the ICE Network    This
              two year project would each year provide 40 teachers of grades 6-8 with
              training in a four  week workshop.  The teachers includes content lectures and
              demonstrations, laboratory work,  chemical safety information, new ideas in
              pedagogy, practical teaching sessions with students  in an associated science
              camp, relationship of chemistry to the other sciences, chemistry and 
              technology, outreach techniques, and group projects.  It is anticipated that
              these 'enhanced  teachers' will on average reach out to an additional 35
              teachers.  This results in a total of 3500  teachers being impacted.  In
              addition to the basic training in the workshops, those teachers who  provide
              local training are eligible to apply for and Affiliate Incentive Award program
              which is  used as seed money for obtaining much higher support from local
              sources to carry out the  ICE-like workshops at the local level.  In addition
              the ICE Network of more than 2500 teachers  will be maintained by a newsletter
              and a new computer-network communications which will link  ICE Field Centers,
              Affiliates, and participants via the Internet.  The cost share is $148,443 or 
              20.5% of the face value of Foundation support.  The project begins in 1994 and
              will run through  1995.
