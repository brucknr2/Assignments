Abstract    :
              9355489  Bad Wound    Oglala Lakota College has made the commitment to initiate
              a new  institution-wide effort to significantly increase the number of 
              American Indian students that earn bachelor's degrees in the  natural sciences,
              computer sciences, engineering, and mathematics  fields (SEM).     This
              planning proposal is unique because:    The application would benefit students
              of the only two-four-year  accredited Tribally Controlled Colleges in the
              Nation, in addition  to two-year Tribal Colleges.    South Dakota National
              Science Foundation Statewide Systemic  Initiative has committed comprehensive
              technical assistance to  enhance the planning process.  Resources provided by
              the SSI will  significantly increase the likelihood that Oglala Lakota College 
              will be able to develop a successful plan, and further to implement  new SEM
              programs for American Indian students.    Oglala Lakota College proposes to
              fully enhance telecommunication  systems through collaborative effort in the
              implementation stage of  this initiative in order to serve American Indians
              nationwide.    South Dakota is a small state where collaboration among 
              Institutions is extensive and permits maximizing of scare  resources.    Oglala
              Lakota College proposes a six month comprehensive planning  process to develop
              four-year cooperative degrees.  Cooperative  degrees could than be offered
              through other institutions including  two-year Tribal Colleges, in addition to
              Oglala Lakota Colleges'  offering and thus significantly increase the number of
              students  impacted.
