              Droske    INSTITUTION:  University of Wisconsin - Stevens Point    TITLE: 
              Using Polymers to Link the Sciences to Each Other and to Our World:  Innovation
              in  the K-12 Curriculum    This project will take place during the summers and
              academic year to follow of 1995 through  1997.  Each of 24 teachers will be
              trained in a three  week workshop in applying polymer  chemistry in their
              classes as appropriate to grade level.  The first year will be 24 secondary 
              school teacher, the second summer 24 middle school teachers and the third
              summer 24  elementary school teachers.  During the second and third summers, 8
              teachers from the previous  summers 24 will be selected to participate in a one
              week leadership workshop.  This workshop  will be held so that it coincides
              with the next group's workshop and so that there can be cross  grade level
              interaction.  During the academic year following each workshop the 24
              participants  will also come together for an additional two day  weekend
              workshop. A very substantial  assessment and evaluation will be carried out
              using both qualitative and quantitative data.  The  total length of the project
              is for 42 months, spanning four summers beginning in 1994.  The   workshops
              will be held at the University of Wisconsin at Stevens Point.  The cost share
              of the  project amounts to 41% of the Foundation support.
