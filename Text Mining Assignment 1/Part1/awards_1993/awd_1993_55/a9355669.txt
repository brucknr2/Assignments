Abstract    :
              9355669  Friedman    The New York Hall of Science will develop and
              institutionalize the  Science Discovery Lab System, providing training and
              ongoing  support in astronomy education for New York City public and private 
              6th and 8th grade science teachers.    This new system provides a model for
              addressing all mandated  science curriculum areas.  The project trains and
              supports 120  teachers via:       a three week, graduate level institute in
              content and pedagogy       provided by college, university and science center
              staff;       peer training in schools and the science center; and      
              tangible ongoing support, including annual Update Conferences,      
              consultation, and provision of high equipment.    The program goals are to:    
                increase teachers' knowledge of astronomy concepts;       change teaching
              methodology from rote to hands-on;       develop a city-wide teacher support
              network       establish ongoing peer training; and       institutionalize these
              improvements on a self-supporting,       long-term basis.    During the grant
              120 teachers will be trained.  They in turn will  instruct their 4200 students
              and train a minimum of 120 additional  teachers.  ***
