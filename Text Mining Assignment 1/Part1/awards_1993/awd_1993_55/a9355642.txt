              9355642 Abstract    Rocky Mountain Secondary Teacher Enhancement Initiative in
              Mathematics (RMSTEIM)    The Rocky Mountain Secondary Teacher Enhancement
              Initiative in Mathematics is a project  to develop a Masters Degree program at
              the University of Northern Colorado.  This three-  year project at $577,260
              will recruit and serve 50 secondary mathematics teachers, 40 high  school and
              10 middle school,  in the three-state area of Colorado, Wyoming, and New 
              Mexico.  The participants will receive enhancement in advanced mathematics that
              is  consistent with shifts in mathematics curriculum reform, use of appropriate
              instructional and  assessment strategies, and preparation in leadership and
              staff development.   Participants will  take two mathematics and two
              mathematics education courses along with  laboratory/colloquiums including
              leadership, staff development, and technology during an  eight-week summer
              session in each of three summers.  All participants and staff will be 
              connected through UNC s  e-mail system.  During the school year, participants
              will design  and conduct follow-up sessions of at least one-half day in
              conjunction with meetings in their  state or region with project staff
              coordination.  UNC plans to sustain an MA in Mathematics  for Teachers centered
              on the courses established in this project.  Cost-sharing from UNC and  school
              districts will cover approximately 20% of the total project.
