Abstract    :
              9355795 Wheeler Two Day Planning Session for Institute for Science/Math
              Educational Change  The proposer requests funding to conduct a two day planning
              meeting (conference) at the at Montana State University (MSU).  National
              leaders who are advocates for educational change in science and mathematics
              will be convened to meet with leaders at MSU to discuss the active involvement
              of scientists and mathematicians in designing an educational change initiative
              for MSU.  Native Americans will be involved to assure that the focus on
              improving education includes knowledgeable expertise and representation of
              Montana's largest minority group.  Participants will develop a working
              "blueprint" to guide implementation of the University's efforts to coordinate
              and enhance the reforms funded by Education and Human Resources (EHR).  The
              recommendations resulting from the conference will guide MSU and will be shared
              with the various NSF initiatives and projects across the state and those who
              may benefit from them outside Montana. ***
