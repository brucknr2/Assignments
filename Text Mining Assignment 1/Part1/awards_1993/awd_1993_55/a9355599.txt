              Vecchione    ABSTRACT    WGBH Educational Foundation is producing a prime time
              television series and informal education outreach component entitled "A Life of
              Science."  Each of the six one-hour programs in the series will profile a
              contemporary woman scientist:  Lydia Villa-Komaroff, biologist; Melissa
              Franklin, physicist; Misha Mahowald, computational neuroscientist; Marcia
              NcNutt, geologist; Lynda Jordan, biochemist; and Patty Jo Watson,
              archaeologist.  The stories will present their scientific quests and careers
              but also will be about scientific lives.      An outreach plan, which centers
              around a national campaign called "The Missing Persons Investigation," will
              target two primary constituencies:  girls and boys 11-14 years of age and their
              adult teachers and youth service community leaders.  The project will serve
              these audiences in formal school-based settings as well as in the informal
              settings of community-based organizations and institutions.  Beyond these
              immediate target groups, the outreach project will reach a broad and diverse
              national public through related activities including demonstrations exhibits,
              community campaigns at local public television stations, and media
              partnerships.  A comprehensive promotion plan has been devised to inform the
              public of both the series and the outreach component of the project.     u    ~
