Abstract    :
              9355614  Rowlett    This project will provide content enrichment, leadership
              training,  network development, and on-site support to a cadre of earth 
              science teachers in grades 6-12 from North Carolina.  Subsequently  they will
              introduce field-based observational projects into their  earth science courses
              in conformity with the state curriculum.  In  six regions, three week summer
              institutes will be conducted by  master teachers and specifically trained earth
              scientists.  During  each of three summers two institutes, each enrolling 25
              teachers as  2-member teams with LEA-support, will be held at different
              regional  sites.  Supported by one-day pre-meeting workshops to devise site- 
              specific needs assessments, post-meeting site visits by staff and  earth
              scientists, follow-up meetings, and inservice development,  the project will
              prepare specifically designed manuals for  implementing earth science field
              projects on school sites and will  model best teaching techniques for hands-on
              learning.  Teachers  will also prepare an Earth Science Action Plan to improve
              their  school's earth science curriculum and to provide inservice to their 
              colleagues.
