              9355507 Dickerson Collaborative Research in Computational Geometry:  algorithms
              and properties for proximity and triangulations.  Exchange visits with a
              Romanian scientist will provide opportunity for collaborative research in
              computational geometry.  Research in proximity problems and triangulations will
              be enhanced by a visit of the senior American scientist to the host Romanian
              university and a subsequent visit from the guest scientist to the United
              States. ***
