Abstract    :
              9355728  Spooner    The Cambridge Public school system is establishing a
              comprehensive  elementary/middle school science program, through the 
              implementation of systemic, district-side science staff  development over four
              years reaching a total of 293 teachers. The  activities will prepare all of the
              elementary and middle school  teachers to teach hands-on, inquiry-based,
              thematic science units  keyed to the Cambridge Science Framework.  All
              secondary school  teachers of grades 7-9 will learn the content and
              instructional  strategies of a thematic, interdisciplinary middle grade science
               program linking the middle and high school curricula.  The methods  to be
              employed to bring about such change include:  training five  Science Staff
              Developers; development of 28 Lead Classroom Teachers  in 14 elementary/middle
              schools; establishment of school based  Science Action Teams; collaboration
              with MIT; and science awareness  seminars for administrators.  Staff
              development and technical  assistance for the training activities will be
              provided by  Education Development Center (EDC); Technical Education Research 
              Center (TERC); and a Core Scientists Group representing local  universities.
