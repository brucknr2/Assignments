Abstract    :
              9355643  Pirkle    Consistent with the Louisiana Curriculum Frameworks the goal
              of the  project is to increase the teaching of activity-based, issues- 
              oriented technologically integrated physical science at the middle  school
              level (grades 7-9).    The project will extend over 4 years.  Two cohorts of
              teachers from  30 schools will be paired in teams (60 teachers) which will be 
              provided with a two year sequence of summer courses (5 weeks study  of
              chemistry and physical science), academic year site visits and  workshops (5
              for each of two years).  The summer courses will be a  sequence of two
              specially designed chemistry and physical science  courses with the content
              appropriate to the middle school level.   Alternative assessment strategies
              will be incorporated.  Computers  and graphing calculators will be integrated
              into the analysis of  experimental data.  Local environmental issues will be
              integrated  into the curriculum.    Funds of $1,483,379 are requested with cost
              share $204,722 (14%).
