Abstract    :
              9355041  Henderson    The University of Utah offers the unique combination of
              researchers  who design and prototype advanced, teleoperated, dextrous robots 
              with those who design and develop intelligent control methodologies  for such
              robots.  We believe that more research is necessary for  the development of
              theory and engineering practice in the use of  such advanced mainpulators as
              interfaces to complicate machine  systems (e.g., from drug design systems to
              nuclear waste handling  systems).  We propose to develop a close relationship
              with North  Carolina A&T (a historically black college) to give the opportunity
               for minority undergraduate students to visit and work in our  research
              laboratories with the ultimate goal of recruiting them  into the Traineeship
              program.  We have also arranged for the  graduate Trainees to spend time at the
              Advanced Robotics Laboratory  at McGill University in Montreal, Canada. 
              Finally, we have also  negotiated a coop arrangement with Sarcos Research
              Corporation  (which builds and sells dextrous arms) to give some industrial 
              experience for both the undergraduate and graduate participants in  the
              program.  ***
