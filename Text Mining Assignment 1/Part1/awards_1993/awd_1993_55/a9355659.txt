Abstract    :
              9355659  Strassenburg    This national 3-year project will:  conduct a national
              needs  assessment of middle school teachers to determine their inservice  needs
              on topics which comply with the emerging national science  standards; provide
              teacher enhancement congruent with those topics  and measure this model's
              effectiveness in generating local district  support and assessing whether local
              demand is sufficient so rosters  will fill reliably to maintain local
              participation which contains  the costs.    Each year fifty teachers at each of
              three sites will participate in  a four-week summer workshop led by an
              instructional team of a  Presidential Awardee middle school teacher, a graduate
              student in  the discipline or a closely allied discipline and a university 
              scientist in the topic area.  The teachers from grades 6-9 will  participate in
              workshop where the pedagogy modeled will reflect  what research shows is
              effective science instruction.  Content and  hands-on activities are drawn from
              a variety of exemplary sources  which were developed with NSF support. (The
              University Physics  Project, SS&C and from the TRIAD Projects).  If the project
               generates the local support anticipated and if local demand is  sufficiently
              so local filling of the rosters contains the cost,  then it's expected that
              this program will become a permanent  feature of NSTA activities.
