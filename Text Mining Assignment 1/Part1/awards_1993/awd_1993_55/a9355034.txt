Abstract    :
              9355034  Palmer    Twenty members of Berkeley's Institute of Cognitive Studies
              propose  an integrated graduate research training program in the 
              interdisciplinary field of cognitive science with a focus on  spatial
              cognition.  We request funds to support a five-year  training program for five
              graduate students to consist of both  coursework and research on the theme of
              spatial cognition,  including spatial perception, language, and reasoning. 
              Students  will we required to take a set of five basic lecture courses and a 
              series of research seminars to ensure adequate background knowledge  in
              computer science, linguistics, psychology, and biology on topics  integral to
              research on spatial cognition.  Research training will  occur as the trainees
              engage in research on topics within a number  of well-established projects at
              Berkeley on the theme of spatial  cognition, including:  (l) cross-linguistic
              studies of lexical  semantics, (2) the nature of spatical and temporal
              metaphors,  (3)the acquisition of spatial language by children in different 
              cultures, (4) the "psychophysics" of spatial terms, (5) the  biological basis
              of spatial cognition, (6) the representation of  spatial knowledge, (7)
              computational models for understanding,  learning, and producing spatial
              descriptions, and (8) biological  aspects of spatial cognition in animals and
              humans.  Both faculty  and trainees will take part in a series of research
              seminars  focusing on the results of these research projects.  ***
