              Principal Investigator's Network (TEPInet)    A principal task is establishing
              a network that could,  among other things, eventually substitute for the annual
              Teacher  Enhancement Project Director meeting.  The focus is on an  important
              functions of this meeting:  the opportunity for PIs  with similar interests to
              exchange information and views. This  focus is on interaction between PIs as an
              enhancement of their  awards.  Additionally, this network will provide
              databases, lists,  "home pages" and the like containing information of interest
              to not  only the PIs but the educational communities they serve and the 
              broader public.    The key concepts for TEPnet are (1) a distributed, 
              electronically-united seminar, and (2) moderated on-line  discussions, based on
              the LABnet model.    Cost sharing is 23% of the total budget.  ***
