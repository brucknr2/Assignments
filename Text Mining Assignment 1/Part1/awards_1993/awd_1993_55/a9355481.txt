Abstract    :
              9355481  Duerst    "Hands-on, Minds-on, Hearts-on" is the theme of three years
              of  3-week Science Institutes for primary (K-3) teachers, with  extensive
              academic year follow-up.  Three groups of thirty-six  lead teachers from 15-19
              schools in rural school districts in  east-central Minnesota and west-central
              Wisconsin will each be  involved for a two-year period.  Initially, each group
              will  participate in a Summer Institute led collaboratively by two  instructors
              from the University of Wisconsin River Fall  (UW-RF)with extensive outreach
              experience, one from the College  of Education and one from the College of Arts
              and Sciences.  The  teachers will receive instruction in presenting hands-on 
              activities and, even more importantly, they will experience  science learning
              and teaching from an inquiry and conceptual  change perspective as they
              explore, field-test, critique and  compare nationally recognized instructional
              materials.  During  the following academic year, these lead teachers will field
              test  selected modules in their own classrooms, with support from the  PIs.  A
              Science Curriculum Lending Library will be established  for use by
              participating districts.  The second summer the same  group will meet again for
              a week on the UW-RF campus to share  experiences and plan inservice workshops
              which they will conduct  for the rest of the K-3 teachers in their own schools
              during the  second academic year.  Since most of the targeted districts are  in
              the transition state from traditional science teaching to  hands-on
              instruction, the teacher-participants will be prepared  to play an important
              role in the shaping of science education in  this region.    The cost sharing
              for the project will be 23% of the NSF award.  ***
