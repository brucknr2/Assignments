Abstract    :
              9355110  Lewis    The purpose of this project is to provide traineeships for
              Ph.D.  students to work with the Controls Group and the Intelligent  Systems
              Group at the University of Texas at Arlington.  The  students who are selected
              to participate in this program will  benefit from the collaboration between
              faculty and Electrical  Engineering and in Computer Science and Engineering to
              further the  state-of-the-art in robot planning and control.  Students will
              also  have the opportunities to perform their research at the University  of
              Texas Automation and Robotics Research Institute (ARRI), and  will have
              extensive interaction with representatives from  international and industrial
              research labs.    The University of Texas at Arlington is committed to
              increasing the  participation of ethnic minorities and females in engineering 
              careers.  The proposed program continues these efforts to recruit  minority and
              female engineers.  As described in this proposal, we  have established strong
              ties with the University of Texas at  Brownsville and Grambling State
              University, and one of the  principal investigators serves as the faculty
              advisor for the local  chapter of the Society of Women Engineers and as a
              co-advisor for  the local chapter of the Society of Hispanic Engineers.  We
              propose  to coordinate with these predominantly Hispanic, African-American, 
              and women-based groups to recruit top students into our program.  ***
