Abstract    :
              Abstract    9355559  Arena    Chemistry and Physics Fundamentals for Middle
              School Minority Teachers or Teachers of Minority Students    This two year
              project for 40 teachers of minorities in grades 6-9 will provide two three week
              workshops over two years to cover the fundamentals of chemistry and physics. 
              The project begins in 1995. It would also provide for 5 Saturday topical
              conferences in each of the two academic years.  During the workshops the
              teachers will:    improve their conceptual knowledge of their chemistry and
              physics;    learn how to integrate appropriate topics in chemistry and physics
              with the other sciences and mathematics and with science and technology issues;
                 become more proficient in the development and presentation of classroom
              activities for science instruction;    develop new teaching materials and
              strategies for teaching the physical sciences in middle schools;    become more
              familiar with the vast array of source materials available for teachers of
              middle school physical science;    Additional goals of the workshops are to:   
              develop networks of middle school and high school teachers within the Southern
              California region to provide on-going mutual support and assistance;   
              encourage teachers to pursue outreach activities to the community and to
              furnish them with the science demonstrations and supplies necessary to perform
              these activities.    The teachers will also have an opportunity to practice
              newly acquired teaching strategies and demonstrations with the middle school
              students in an associated Chemistry/Physics Camp.   The cost share of the
              project is 5% of the face value of Foundation support.
