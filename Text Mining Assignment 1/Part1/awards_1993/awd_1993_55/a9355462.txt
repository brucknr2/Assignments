Abstract    :
              9355462  Merideth    The New York City Urban Cities Initiative (UCI) seeks
              funding to  develop a comprehensive plan of operation designed to increase the 
              access, participation, and success of New York's underrepresented  students in
              mathematics and science education. The UCI, a  collaborative of key city
              stakeholders, has assisted in the  planning process and has helped to identify
              key strategies that  will lead to systemic reform in mathematics and science
              education.  The UCI planning team will agree upon actions to implement a shared
               vision and will solicit endorsement from cooperating institutions.    Planning
              grant goals are: to identify the needs of the diverse  communities served by
              the school system; to involve key  stakeholders in exploring the constructivist
              learning theory; to  collect and interpret base line data; to identify and
              prioritize  the use of fiscal resources; to build consensus for a vision of 
              mathematics and science education; and to prepare and submit a  comprehensive
              USI proposal for New York City Schools.    Three groups (USI Systemic
              Management Team; USI Cabinet; and USI  Working Groups) will be convened to
              assist in the implementation of  the self-study.
