Abstract    :
              9355473  Cunniff  Prince George's Community College is developing and
              coordinating a  two-day invitational conference for the principal investigators
               from the two-year and four-year coalitions that have been supported  under the
              Undergraduate Faculty Enhancement (UFE)program.  In  addition, several
              principal investigators who have been supported  under Calculus and the Course
              and Curriculum Development (CCD) that  are coalition type activities and other
              selected individuals with  expertise in coalition building are also attending. 
              A guidebook  for individuals who are developing, planning, and leading 
              coalitions is being written.  The guidebook contains such  information as
              descriptions of successful coalitions, barriers to  coalition building and
              models for overcoming these barriers, other  potential coalition models,
              recruitment strategies, evaluation  mechanisms, and methods for sustaining
              coalitions.  Each coalition  represented is also developing as a result of this
              conference a  manuscript for submission to a newsletter or professional journal
               about their coalition activities.  ***
