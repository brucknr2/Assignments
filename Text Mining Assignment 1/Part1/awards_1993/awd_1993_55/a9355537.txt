Abstract    :
              9355537  Yager    At each of four sites two satellite districts will be added to
              the  Iowa SS&C project.  The four original sites are Mason City,  Davenport,
              Chariton and Creston.  The six new sites which will  provide statewide coverage
              areCharles City, Hampton, Denison,  Johnston, Iowa City and Fairfield.  These
              latter sites will test  the transportability of the Iowa SS&C model. 
              Frameworks and  approaches will be completed for grades 6-8 and continue the
              work  started in grades 9-10.  At each of the four sites 30 teachers will 
              participate.  Different leaders 6-8 will be involved as the middle  school
              programs are completed.  Ninth grade teachers will be the  major focus for
              1994-95 and tenth grade teachers for 1995-96.  Over  the three year period of
              the project 120 teachers in grades 6-10  will participate.    The Teacher
              Enhancement activities follow the Iowa Chautauqua  inservice model: a two week
              leadership conference including  teachers from each site and all grade levels;
              a 3-week summer  workshop at each site for all teachers at a given grade level,
              with  representative teachers from preceding and following grades; two  day
              courses each academic semester for site leaders and other  personnel; weekly
              meetings of teachers at specific grade levels in  each participating school;
              and, monthly 2-day inservice meetings  involving all teachers at each site.   
              As part of the project evaluation student learning is assessed in  6-domains
              via pre- and post-test methods.  The cost-sharing support  comes from local
              schools, intermediate school districts, the Iowa  Utility Association, other
              industries and the University of Iowa.
