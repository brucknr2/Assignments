Abstract    :
              9355832  Foss    A computer-aided modeling environment is to be developed and 
              integrated into the educational scope of the core undergraduate  chemical
              engineering curriculum.  Through this environment, a  structured set of steps,
              needed by students learning how to model  physical and chemical process
              behavior, is coordinated with an  interactive modeling language that is
              designed to provide  instantaneous feedback to the students on the consistency,
               completeness, and reasonableness of their model.  The modeling  language
              coordinates the terms describing the physical and chemical  phenomena, declared
              by the student as important to the content of  the model, and composes the
              mathematical relationships that form  the expression of the resulting model. 
              Numerical algorithms are  then employed to produce through interactive
              simulation the static  or/and dynamic solution of the mathematical model, and
              thus allow  students to familiarize themselves with the behavior of the modeled
               process, as well as compare it to the expected behavior of the  real-world
              system.    A structured approach to guiding the student through the often 
              torturous path of modeling is to be developed in collaboration with  the course
              instructors.  The approach is to bring to the students  an awareness and
              practice in (i) rationalizing the need for a  model, (ii) setting objectives
              for the model within a problem's  context, (iii) perceiving the cause-effect
              relationships, (iv)  articulating the physics of the process, (v) stating 
              representations of the phenomena, (vi) observing the behavioral 
              characteristics of the model built, and (vii) using these  characteristics for
              the resolution of the given problem.  Such  structured guidance is to be
              coordinated with the use of the  modeling language and integrated within the
              scope of undergraduate  core chemical engineering courses in such a way that
              the modeling  task for the student is embedded within a problem needing
              solution,  so that the problem's context and objectives are ma de clear.  
              Significant components of the proposed work involve developing the  individual
              modeling projects for use in the modeling language and  redesign and
              translation of a prototype version of the modeling  language for use on
              personal computers.    It is expected that the completion of the proposed
              project will  have a significant impact on the undergraduates' education since,
               (a) the student will be free to experiment and thus learn from  immediate
              feedback of their errors, and (b) the understanding of  the "foundation
              phenomena" will be reenforced through the  contextual solution of non-trivial
              engineering problems.  ***
