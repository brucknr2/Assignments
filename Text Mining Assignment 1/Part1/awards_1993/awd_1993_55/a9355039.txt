Abstract    :
              9355039  Sinha    This proposal requests support for 5 graduate research
              traineeships  in atmospheric chemistry.  The research and education program 
              described involves the study of a variety of problems in  stratospheric and
              tropospheric chemistry.  In addition to graduate  research, a complete graduate
              education curriculum in environmental  science, with an emphasis on the
              atmosphere, is described.  The  five individual research programs described are
              involved in a  variety of interdisciplinary and collaborative work. 
              Interactions  between these groups foster and excellent environment for
              learning  all aspects of atmospheric chemistry.  The collective group  meetings
              and course offerings provide a sound foundation for the  proposed training
              program.  Problem solving is emphasized in the  educational process.  ***
