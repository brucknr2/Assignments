Abstract    :
              Abstract  The University of Tampa - P. Fingar  Connection to NSFNET  Proposal
              No.  NCR-9355010  The University of Tampa request support from NSF for
              connection of  their campus networks to SURAnet.  SURAnet is the midlevel
              network  located in the southeastern United States.  It will provide 
              operations management and information services and it will give   the
              University of Tampa a 56 thousand bits per second connection to  the NSFNET, a
              high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per second)  National Backbone network.   
              The university needs greater functionality and network speed to be  able to
              access supercomputers, libraries, and make file transfers  along with being
              able to implement a more reliable mail system.   Students and faculty research
              will benefit from the link.  This is  also a unique opportunity for the schools
              to explore innovative  educational resources.
