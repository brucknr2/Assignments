Abstract    :
              9355531  Wood    This project develops implements, and evaluates a model for 
              providing teacher enhancement activities to schools having  maintained
              exemplary elementary science programs over an extended  period of time.  The
              project (1) identifies indicators within and  beyond the framework of the
              concern-based adoption model (CBAM)  that measure the extent of
              institutionalization of exemplary  elementary science programs and apply the
              identified indicators to  a study of a SCIS-based program maintained within the
              Frederick  County (MD) Public Schools for twenty years (2) implements teacher 
              enhancement activities within these schools based upon findings  from this
              study, and (3) uses these indicators to evaluate the  impact of the enhancement
              activities and to allow the school system  to continuously monitor and respond
              to its teacher enhancement  needs.    Eighteen weeks of training are provided
              to seven science  specialists and nine weeks to thirty school-based lead
              teachers.   Project staff and these trained specialists and lead teachers 
              provide training to the remaining 710 teachers in the county based  upon their
              identified needs.  Insights are obtained on activities  that effectively
              maintain elementary science programs in schools.  ***
