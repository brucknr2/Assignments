Abstract    :
              9355756    Johnson    The proposed study seeks to provide important information
              on the  effectiveness of high school and college level assessments in 
              facilitating students' achievement, and in developing positive  attitudes
              toward mathematics and science in predominantly African  American populations, 
              The study will gather information on the  thinking and problem solving
              processes used by students during  performance assessments, as well as the
              degree to which the  experience of participating in a performance assessment
              was  positive.  The study will validate performance assessments in terms  of
              appropriateness of the measures, their alignment with the  curriculum and
              pedagogy, and their achievement of the intended  purpose.
