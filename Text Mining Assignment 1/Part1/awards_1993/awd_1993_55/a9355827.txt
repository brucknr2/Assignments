Abstract    :
              9355827  Bell    This is a four-month planning project by two major NSF
              mathematics  curriculum development projects (UCSMP at The University of
              Chicago  and TERC, Cambridge, MA) to develop a proposal for large-scale 
              elementary teacher enhancement project for the April, 1994 NSF  Teacher
              Enhancement submission.  The project staffs and associated  publishers will
              seek to develop a plan to provide teachers with  appropriate foundations for
              using any curriculum that is aligned  with recent reform recommendations.
