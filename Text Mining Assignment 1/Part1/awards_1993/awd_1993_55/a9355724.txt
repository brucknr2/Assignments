Abstract    :
              9355724  Marcinkowski    This three-year project will involve middle school
              teachers in  the acquisition, implementation and evaluation of carefully 
              selected science content and STS issue instruction strategies in  middle school
              classrooms.  With the support of education service  centers, and participation
              from nine participating school  districts, in the Central and South Florida
              region, project staff  will train teams of key middle school teachers and
              supervisors in  summer institute settings.  Instruction will include science 
              content, a wide range of regional STS issues, strategies for  investigating and
              evaluating STS issues, issue resolution skills,  and two well-researched
              strategies for teaching this content to  middle school students.  Subsequent to
              each institute,  participants will apply these skills, and report their
              results.  Over each school year, participants will implement and evaluate  much
              of this content, including one issue instruction strategy,  in their
              classrooms.  As a part of the projects evaluation, the  teachers will report
              the results of their efforts to project  staff and participants in a regular
              spring meeting.  In Year 3  district teams will participate in a summer seminar
              designed to  prepare them to offer inservice sessions to their colleagues. 
              Once trained cadres of teachers and articulated instructional  programs are in
              place, extensive data will be collected to assess  impact and program
              effectiveness.    The cost sharing will be 42 percent of the NSF funds.  ***
