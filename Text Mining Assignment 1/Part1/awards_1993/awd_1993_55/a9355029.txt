Abstract    :
              9355029  Sorooshian    The University of Arizona's Department of Hydrology and
              Water  Resources will expand its research and teaching efforts to the  target
              key area of hydrology to augment current areas to include  (Figure 1):        
              o  hydroclimatology/hydrometeorology       o  environmental hydrology       o 
              water resources engineering    Accelerated degree programs, including
              Bachelor-to-Doctorate and  Master's thesis-alternative options, will support
              new research  initiatives, as well as retrain current professionals to bring
              them  into the work force.  Multidisciplinary research will train a more 
              diverse group of new scientists in hydroclimatology, to investigate  global
              climate change, its effect on regional water resources, and  ensuing political
              and social alterations, and in hydrometeorology,  to deal with
              surface-atmosphere interaction in a new and more  integrated manner. 
              Environmental hydrology will integrate surface-  and subsurface-water study for
              better understanding of these  interactions, as well as contaminant transport
              phenomena and water  chemistry processes.  In this respect, an accelerated
              option will  provide an excellent retraining program for degreed professionals 
              currently unable to contribute to an environmentally-focused world:   petroleum
              engineers, exploration geologists, and other resource  scientists.  Water
              resources engineering will prepare students for  nonstructural aspects of
              rebuilding the national water resources  infrastructure and improvement of
              water supply reliability and  remediation activities through use of more
              sophisticated  technologies.  ***
