Abstract    :
              9355717  Witmer    The SEAQL project will enhance the middle and high school
              science  teacher's performance in the classroom/laboratory where the  standard
              sciences-biology, chemistry, physics earth science and  general science are
              taught.  Instruction monitoring and evaluation  in the use of simple, yet
              powerful statistical tools in the  analysis of data and the use of technology
              is planned.    Objectives are to:         Upgrade science teachers quantitative
              literacy knowledge and       skills through instructional vehicles-field
              testing, the       teacher institute and follow ups.         Instruct teachers
              in educational pedagogy as well as       technology and statistical and
              probabilistic QL strands that       will enhance science lessons.         Field
              test a refine science lessons by means of several       iterations.        
              Disseminate information using the multiplier effect-institute      
              participants in servicing colleagues, through professional       organizations
              and commercial publications.    During the 3 year project 255 science teachers
              throughout the  United States will participate in on going field testing and 
              refining of lessons.  Four week teacher institutes will follow ups  are
              planned.    SEAQL will build on ASA's Quantitative Literacy Project in 
              mathematics.    Funds of $1,919,723 are requested with cost share of $84,770
