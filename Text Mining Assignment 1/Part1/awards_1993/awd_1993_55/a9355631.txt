Abstract    :
              9355631  Humphrey         The Exploratorium is developing a model program that 
              demonstrates the vital role science museum exhibits can play  in supporting
              formal science education reform.  The  development of exhibitions and
              enhancement activities is  based on the Science Framework for California Public
              Schools  and the emerging National Science Education Standards.  The  project
              includes:     A series of four museum exhibitions (with a total of 60    
              exhibits) based on the Science Framework themes of     Patterns of Change,
              Stability, Scale and Structure, and     Systems and Interactions    
              Publications (Exhibit Guides and Pathways) for each     collection     A series
              of workshops and evening events for teachers,     families and students     A
              symposium, video and Internet resource for museum and     education
              professionals         An important feature is an information desk and  resource
              kiosk to inform teachers, parents and the general  public about science
              education reform efforts.  The project  aims at 5,000 teachers, 32,000 parents
              and caregivers,  140,000 students and 1,320,000 members of the general  public.
