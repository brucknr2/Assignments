Abstract    :
              9355470  Westgate  The Frontiers in Education Conference has become one of the 
              leading forums for the dissemination of information on  engineering education. 
              It consistently attracts strong  participation from engineering faculty
              directly involved in  classroom and laboratory instruction, from department
              chairs  and deans of engineering and allied sciences, and from research 
              organizations and government agencies supporting educational  programs.  This
              conference is the ideal forum for the direct  dissemination of results from
              NSF-sponsored engineering  curriculum developments to the faculty who can adapt
              these  developments in their own programs.  Among the major presenters  at the
              conference are members of the NSF-sponsored Engineering  Coalitions.  This
              project will 1) expand the distribution of program  announcements to faculty in
              all engineering disciplines, 2)  provide travel grants to allow principal
              investigators of  particularly compelling projects to present their work at the
               conference, and 3) provide travel grants to allow allow up to  50 K-12
              teachers to attend the conference and lend their  expertise in teaching to the
              conference participants while they  gain increased understanding of the
              engineering disciplines.  ***
