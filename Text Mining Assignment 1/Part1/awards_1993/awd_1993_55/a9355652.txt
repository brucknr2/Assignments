Abstract    :
              9355652  Klyczek    This project will provide an inservice program in
              biotechnology for  both secondary life science and agriculture education
              teachers  through a variety of workshop settings.  The intent is to address 
              the local, state, and national recommendations to increase the  science aspect
              of agriculture and to create opportunities for  agriculture education and life
              science teachers to work together.   The program will provide participants with
              new scientific knowledge  related to biotechnology, specifically including:
              gene cloning,  tissue culture, DNA analysis, and genetic modification of plants
               and animals; laboratory experiences that illustrate new techniques  in
              biology; information that is important from a consumer point of  view, e.g.
              practical applications of biotechnology in agriculture  and medicine;
              opportunities to share teaching experiences;  successful demonstrations,
              teaching strategies, and laboratory  experiences; and opportunities to discuss
              public concerns and  ethical issues related to biotechnology.  The project will
              reach a  minimum of 300 teachers in Wisconsin, Minnesota, and South Dakota.
