Abstract    :
                High performance Computing and Communications (HPCC) is evolving  as a
              critical enabling technology for the sciences.  We propose a  program to
              integrate HPCC into selected research areas in the  physical sciences.  The
              program will be based around a core group  of faculty who collectively span the
              required knowledge base and  who are currently involved in joint
              interdisciplinary research  programs.  The primary mechanism will be the joint
              supervision of  a student's research by two of the PI's.    The PI's for this
              proposal will be faculty members in three  departments:  Aerospace Engineering
              Sciences (AES),  Astrophysical, Planetary and Atmospheric Sciences (APAS) and 
              Computer Science (CS), joined by a Co-I in Physics, J. Dreitlein.    These four
              departments are nationally recognized by their active  and productive graduate
              programs.  Inter-departmental  collaboration has increased with the award of a
              prestigious,  multi-disciplinary HPCC Grand Challenge Applications Grant by NSF
               in 1992.  HPCC awards from ARPA and NASA have further increased  opportunities
              for interaction and outreach.  These awards have  provided state-of-the-art
              HPCC facilities available to GRT  trainees.    The graduate trainees will spend
              substantial residence periods at  national supercomputer centers, government
              and industry research  laboratories and international HPC centers.
