Abstract    :
                  9355735 Abstract    The Mathematics Teacher Institute is a three-year
              project, at $547,098, through the   California State University, Dominguez
              Hills Foundation to provide teacher enhancement to  50 area high school
              teachers in schools that will receive students from the Renaissance  Middle
              Grades Mathematics Project.  Participants will be involved for three summers,
              each  with six school year follow-up sessions.  The first two summers will
              include 4-week  programs with a focus on mathematics content, unifying
              curriculum themes, instructional  strategies, and use of technology in moving
              to a standards-based high school curriculum.   The third summer session will be
              one week with a focus on designing a school plan and staff  development
              activities with involvement of the building principal.
