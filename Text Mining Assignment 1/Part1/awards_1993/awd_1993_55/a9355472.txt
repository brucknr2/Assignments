Abstract    :
              9355372  Groza  The propose of this project is to explore the feasibility of a 
              joint American - Romanian research effort on diffusion measurements  to develop
              new, lead-free soldering alloy for micro-electronic  applications. The focus is
              twofold:  (a) to explore the feasibility  of performing diffusion experiments
              in a Romanian laboratory and  (b) to improve the complex diffusion programs
              developed in Romania  by using powerful American computational systems.  The
              completion  of this work will demonstrate our ability to further develop a 
              joint program on diffusion studies of new soldering alloys.  These  alloys are
              critical for environmentally safe processing and  therefore considerably
              contribute to the development of new and  viable technologies to benefit both
              countries.  We expect this  short term collaboration to strengthen our chances
              to develop a  long term interaction between scientists in the United States and
               Eastern Europe on priority engineering issues.  ***
