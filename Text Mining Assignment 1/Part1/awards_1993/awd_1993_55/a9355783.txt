Abstract    :
              Stefanich  9355783    This project will conduct a conference on effective
              science  education for students with disabilities.  The conference will be 
              held for two days just prior to the 1994 National Science  Teachers Association
              Annual Convention in Anaheim, California.  The  conference will include invited
              papers, panels, and working groups  to evaluate current practices and future
              directions in science  education for students with disabilities.  The major
              purpose of the  conference is to educate science teacher educators, science 
              teachers, and professionals providing services and/or equipment to  persons
              with disabilities as to what resources and strategies are  effective in
              providing science education for persons with  disabilities.  Recommendations
              for improved practice will be shared  and responded to by participants. 
              Information in areas of career  concerns, teacher education, methods,
              materials/programs,  dissemination, evaluation and assessment, and educational 
              organizations and agencies will be compiled and prepared into a  document for
              conference participants.  A publication will be  developed following the
              conference, and become available to  interested individuals and agencies at a
              nominal cost.  ***
