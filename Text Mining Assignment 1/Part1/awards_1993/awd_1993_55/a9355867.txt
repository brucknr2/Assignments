Abstract    :
               9355867  Brazziel    This project is concerned with describing institutional
              programs in  higher education that promise to increase the number of minorities
               in the science and engineering doctoral programs.  The PI promises  to
              investigate 4 year college programs that have been successful in  promoting
              minority students through the science and engineering  fields toward higher
              degrees.  The study would be conducted by data  analysis of the NAS doctoral
              record files supplemented with data  from the Astin CIRP.  Then the PIs would
              conduct an on site  investigation of 10 colleges to describe their programs 
              qualitatively.  The PIs propose to do this study within 3 months.  ***
