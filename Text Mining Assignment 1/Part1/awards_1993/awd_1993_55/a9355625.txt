Abstract    :
              9355625  Cassady    The Children's Museum of Indianapolis is developing a new
              permanent  12,000 square-foot gallery, "The Wet, Wild, Wonderful World of 
              Science: A Science Gallery That Connects Kids to Their World."  Water is the
              catalyst for the exploration and discovery of science  concepts throughout the
              gallery.  Within the gallery are three hub  context areas (Pipes and Pumps,
              Streams and Ponds,Tubes and Flasks)  that are closely linked, both conceptually
              and physically.  The  message is that the concepts introduced in one hub also
              apply to  the others, thus erasing artificial distinctions between natural  and
              physical sciences.         The goals of the project are:         To create a
              gallery that will make science accessible to the       museum's current and
              underserved visitors.         To create hands-on opportunities for young people
              to practice       scientific thinking so they may better understand the
              physical       and natural world.         To create a science education
              experience that promotes       linkages for visitors between the learning of
              science in the       gallery and formal and informal learning outside of the   
                 museum.         To research the application of constructivist theory in the 
                   design of hands-on exhibits.  ***
