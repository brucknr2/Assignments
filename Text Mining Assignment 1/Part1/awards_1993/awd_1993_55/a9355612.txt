Abstract    :
              9355612  Zubrowski         This EDC project develops and conducts a pilot test
              of a  collection of video and print materials for teacher enhancement  to
              support teacher understanding and use of concrete materials  and phenomena in
              middle school science education.  The materials  focus on developing teachers'
              skills in observing and supporting  "hands-on" investigation and exploration. 
              The videos provide  documentary footage of the many ways in which students
              interact  with a range of materials common in middle school physical  science. 
              Print resources provide a surround for the videos.         The project
              emphasizes research and evaluation to identify  how the design and content of
              the materials can maximize the  impact on teachers' understanding and practice,
              and the use of  the materials by instructors in different settings.  The
              project  also explores strategies for distribution.  Following the pilot  it is
              anticipated that a full set of materials will be produced  and distributed.
