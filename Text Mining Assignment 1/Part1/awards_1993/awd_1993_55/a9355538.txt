Abstract    :
              Tedder  9355538      RESCUE will work with the Central Connecticut State
              University and  other university and business partners to conduct a three year 
              Middle Grades Math and Science teacher leader program.  The program  will
              enhance the skills of 90 teachers in 10 urban, rural and  suburban areas. 
              Another 900 K-12 teachers will be served in  leadership activities given by
              these teachers.  Twelve teachers who  helped plan the project will serve as the
              core of the first cadre  of participants and will assume increasing
              responsibility for  project leadership over the three years.  Project elements
              include  1) Introducing participants to national math and science standards 
              projects and exemplary curricula.2) enhancing participants  knowledge by doing
              math and science through constructivist  approaches, applying technology and
              working with authentic  assessment.3) year round site mentoring and
              professional  development 4) introducing strategies to increase the
              participation  of females and minorities in SEM 5) assisting grade 5-8
