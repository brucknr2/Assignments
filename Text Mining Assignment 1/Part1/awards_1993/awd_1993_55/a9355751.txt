Abstract    :
              9355751  Luedeman    This is a 4-year project to prepare a cadre of 39 teachers
              and 13  college professors to take on leadership roles and become resources  to
              support the introduction of statistics into the mathematics  curriculum of
              South Carolina middle and high schools.  To these  ends, the prospective
              leaders participate in a program of 2  sequential 3-week summer institutes. 
              The Summer 1 institute  program focuses on data analysis and probability; the
              Summer 2  program, on estimation, decision making and hypothesis testing.  In 
              addition to providing content background, the institutes also  provide the
              participants opportunities to; adapt existing exemplary  materials (STAT-LINC)
              to the needs of their respective schools;  develop their own teaching units;
              get leadership training; and  examine how the new topics in statistics can be
              fitted into the  already crowded mathematics curriculum.  Participants are
              selected  state-wide in 13 teams, each team consisting of 3 middle and high 
              school teachers, and 1 college professor.  Upon returning home, the  teams take
              up (part-time) residence at the State SSI's 13 regional  resource centers
              (HUBS) in order to act as resources in  probability/statistics for their
              respective regions.  In Years 3  and 4 of the project, there are a number of
              regional conferences  designed to begin to involve other teachers.  Plans also
              call for  holding an evaluation session, and staff and participants make 
              presentations at various state, regional, and international  conferences.   
              Cost-sharing is about 25% of the NSF contribution.
