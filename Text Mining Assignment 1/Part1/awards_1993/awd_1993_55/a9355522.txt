              $3,695,700  Anticipated Completion Date:  Fall 1998    ABSTRACT    WGBH will
              develop, produce, and distribute a comprehensive project that will review
              science of the twentieth century.  The major components of the project will be
              a series of five, two-hour, prime time documentary programs for PBS, an
              outreach campaign to involve the public through informal and formal science
              education institutions and organizations, material for use in formal
              classrooms, and a science museum component.    The focus of the series will be
              to review the science of the twentieth century by telling the dramatic story of
              the struggle to understand ourselves and our world over the past 100 years -- a
              time when science advanced further than in previous eras combined and when
              scientific discipline underwent a revolution.  However, because at the close of
              the century there is an ever-widening gap between what scientists know and what
              most of the public comprehends, the series will explore the century's most
              enduring scientific endeavors with each two-hour program probing several
              related fields of investigation and application:  views of the universe and of
              matter; origins of the Earth and of life; health, medicine, and the human body;
              human nature and behavior; and technology and engineering.  It will offer
              viewers an opportunity to view 100 years of scientific pursuits as a whole, to
              recast their perceptions of science and scientists, and to be intrigued and
              inspired by a view of science as a never-ending and deeply human quest for
              answers and solutions.      The outreach component of the project include:    o
              Video-based Components - videocassettes of the series, video modules selected
              for classroom use, level one videodiscs, and a prototype for a CD-ROM for home
              learning.    o A Discovery Challe nge Activity - a national campaign targeted
              primarily for girls and boys 11-14 years of age.  The two-phase activities will
              be offered through middle school science and social studies classes; through
              youth groups such as Girls Inc., Family Science Programs, 4-H, and Girls and
              Boys Clubs; at museums and science centers; and through other informal
              education outlets.  Activities will be designed so they can be undertaken by
              youth with a wide range of interests, learning styles, and skills.    o Print
              Components - teacher's guide, video module activity guide, videodisc guide,
              poster, and a companion trade book.      o On-line Component - an electronic
              bulletin board and e-mail center related to the project.  Public access sites
              will be established in libraries, community centers, and schools throughout the
              country and members of the public with home computers will be able to connect
              to WGBH at no cost.  Service and activities offered on-line will include the
              ability of viewers to critique programs, ask questions of the production team,
              download educational materials, and ordering project material.  The bulletin
              board will provide an electronic forum for educators to exchange strategies and
              ideas as they use the project's resources and enable participants in the
              Discovery Challenge to tap into the on-line resources and share information. 
              The on-line component will be managed and controlled at WGBH.    o Museum
              Component - consisting of a museum tool kit and activities to be incorporated
              Science-by-Mail.    Paula Apsell, executive producer for NOVA and director of
              the WGBH Science Unit, will serve as executive-in-charge of production.  Jon
              Palfreman will be executive producer and will head up a project team consisting
              of the executive editor, Thomas Friedman, a senior producer, and two producers.
               Outreach activities will be the responsibility of Beth Kirsch, Director of
              Educational Print and Outreach, and Simone Bloom, Outreach Manager.
