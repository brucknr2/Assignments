Abstract    :
              9355028  Garrett    We propose Traineeships in Cognitive Science, with emphasis
              on  human language systems.  Cognitive Science is an inherently 
              interdisciplinary enterprise, and the program at Arizona provides  coverage in
              all principal areas of study.  For the purposes of the  GRT, however, we target
              natural language processing as the specific  interdisciplinary focus that will
              unite trainees' experience.   Every trainee will receive a grounding in formal,
              computational,  and experimental approaches to language study, and will bring
              that  training to bear on research problems that connect language to  other
              major classes of cognitive processing.    Each trainee will be a Ph.D. student
              in one of three departments  participating in the Arizona Cognitive Science
              program:  Linguistics, Psychology and Philosophy.  Major study areas in the 
              Cognitive Science Program are:  (1) Formal and Computational Models  of
              Language Structure, (2) Language Processing, (3) Linguistic and  Cognitive
              Development, (4) Visual Cognition, (5) Knowledge  Representation and Reasoning,
              (6) Cognitive Neuroscience.  All  students will undergo interdisciplinary
              training in areas (1) and  (2), and in addition will undertake study in at
              least one of the  other areas.  Each Trainee's program will include a GRT core 
              curriculum that identifies specific course work in areas (1) and  (2); this
              will be supplemented by material selected from other  areas suited ot the
              particular major and research interest of each  trainee.  ***
