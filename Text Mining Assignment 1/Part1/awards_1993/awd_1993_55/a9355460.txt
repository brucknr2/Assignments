Abstract    :
              9355460  Agrawal  The activity between the IMRL and the Slovak Technical
              University  in Bratislava will strengthen the cooperative research which the 
              two institutions have been carrying out for the past several years.   This
              activity has benefited both research units in developing new  methods and new
              materials in the area of material/ceramic research,  and the participating
              researchers have gained new knowledge in  their respective areas of expertise. 
              The experience of the guest  partner in the area of the solid state processes
              occurring at high  temperatures in various environments would of great help to 
              understand the sintering behavior of hydroxyapatite.  ***
