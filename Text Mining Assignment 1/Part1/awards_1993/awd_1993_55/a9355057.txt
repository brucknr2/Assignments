Abstract    :
              9355057  Ulsoy     This graduate research traineeship program is designed to
              educate  highly motivated manufacturing professionals with advanced degrees.  
              The focus of this program will be in the area of machine tool  technology.   
              This program has designed a number of new features to attract and  retain top
              quality students, in particular from underrepresented  groups.  The training
              activities include course work in  manufacturing and related areas, active
              participation in weekly  graduate student seminars, early involvement as
              research assistants  in industrially relevant research projects, and the
              potential for  summer internships at industrial facilities, as well as student 
              exchange programs with some leading machine tool research institute  in Europe
              and Asia.  ***
