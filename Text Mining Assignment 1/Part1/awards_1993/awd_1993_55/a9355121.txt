Abstract    :
              9355121  Goff       Many highly specialized parasites such as ant parasites,
              fungi  that parasitize other fungi, and red algal parasites may have  evolved
              from their hosts.  Dr. Lynda Goff of University of  California at Santa Cruz is
              testing this hypothesis in a group of  red algae (Rhodophyta).  Because of the
              extreme morphological  reduction that occurs frequently in parasites, key
              morphological  features required for detailed evolutionary analyses are often 
              missing in parasites.  In such cases, molecular data from DNA  sequences
              promise abundant, comparative evidence for reconstructing  phylogenetic
              relationships and thus inferring evolutionary origins.   Red algae in various
              groups of the orders Gigartinales and  Ceramiales are being studied, to test
              whether host-parasite pairs  are also phylogenetic sister-groups, with major
              evidence expected  from nuclear ribosomal DNA.       The research will provide
              a direct test of what has been  called Emery's Rule in biology, the
              hypothesized evolution of  parasitic forms from their host species.  In
              addition, the new  molecular data when integrated with traditional
              morphological  characters will help improve the taxonomy of several groups of 
              marine red algae.
