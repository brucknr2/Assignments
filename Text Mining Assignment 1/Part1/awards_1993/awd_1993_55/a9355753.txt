Abstract    :
              9355753  Bell    This teacher enhancement project is a collaborative effort
              between  the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAS) and 
              George Mason University (GMU).  It is a four year program to  prepare 40-middle
              school teachers in 3 and 4 member teams to  implement "integrated environmental
              science and technology  education into their science curriculum.  Each team
              participates in  a two-year program; teams include a science teacher, a
              computer  science or mathematics teacher and a technology education teacher 
              from the same school; teams come from DC, MD, PA, VA and WV.  Two  sets of
              teacher teams will participate.    During the program, each teacher team will: 
              (1) increase their  knowledge of environmental science, mathematics, computer 
              technologies and technology education, as well as pedagogical  content; (2)
              adapt and develop units of study that link science  content with appropriate
              teaching and assessment strategies; and  (34) disseminate to other teachers the
              process for developing an  integrated curriculum and team approach to teaching.
               At GMU  teachers will work in small groups to solve problems related to 
              scientist/engineer partners and school administrators.  The  comprehensive
              project evaluation is designed to determine (1) how  successful (in terms of
              student outcomes) are the teachers and  units they adapted/developed, (2) how
              well the team concept  transfers, and (3) how successful (in terms of student
              outcomes)  are the teachers trained through the dissemination workshops with 
              units developed by others.
