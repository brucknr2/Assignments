Abstract    :
              9355589  Austin    Project SCORE (Science Concepts Organized Reinforced and
              Enhanced)  is a program designed by teachers and university professionals to 
              develop a long term interactive support system for teachers in  Prince George's
              County, Maryland who teach life sciences.  The  premise of the project
              acknowledges the critical role of the  teacher in science education and the
              responsibility of higher  educational institutions in providing support for
              teachers.  An  interdisciplinary core of university science content teachers, 
              government and private industry scientists and other educational  professionals
              will introduce teachers to the latest scientific  information in the life
              sciences via hands-on laboratory  experiences and learning resources (kits,
              modules, etc.).    Project SCORE consists of three summer science institutes
              for  twenty-five new mentor teachers each year who will mentor teachers  in
              schools in Prince George's County.  The mentor teachers and  mentorees will be
              given sustained support throughout the year by  Howard University science
              content teachers and graduate students.   Life science awareness workshops will
              also be conducted for parents  and students.
