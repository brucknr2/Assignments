Abstract    :
              9355871  Clark                   This project, the Women's Triad Project for
              Science Education, is directed toward  enhancing gender equity in science
              education for teachers, scientists, and San Francisco  Unified School District
              students.  The strategy through which this mission will be  accomplished
              centers around the establishment of science clubs for middle school girls.  
              Each club will be coordinated by a team of two University of California, San
              Francisco  women scientists, and one woman middle school teacher who will all
              serve as mentors  for the students.  The girls will gain hands-on experience in
              science investigation and use  of tools, as well as opportunities to apply
              their skills and knowledge to group projects.   The scientists will develop
              teaching and communication behaviors that foster gender  equity in their own
              interactions with students and colleagues over the course of their  careers. 
              Workshops on gender equity will also be provided for other science teachers, 
              male and female, at all grade levels, improving the overall climate for gender
              equity in  the District.  ***
