Abstract    :
                The Purdue University plant genetics faculty proposes to  establish an
              interdepartmental graduate training program.  This  proposal has a currently
              interactive core staff of 18 faculty  representing classical, biochemical,
              physiological, and molecular  genetics and genetic engineering.  The proposed
              NSF Training  Grant Program in Plant Genetics will emphasize graduate training 
              in fundamental concepts of modern genetics, and the integrated  application of
              genetics across the range of steps from the gene  to the whole organism.  The
              participants in the program have  productive genetic research programs directed
              toward basic  biological questions that are unique to and /or particularly 
              tractable in plant systems; plant disease resistance, plant  growth and
              development, plant genome analysis, and plant genetic  engineering.  Future
              graduates of the proposed program will  possess not only a broad range of
              molecular skills, but will also  be thoroughly indoctrinated in questions in
              the major areas of  plant biology.
