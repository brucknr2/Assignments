              Abstract    93-55541  Belleview Public Schools, District #118  Michael Koenig,
              Jerry P. Becker  Developing Elementary and Middle School Mathematics 
              Professionals    This project is a 3-year teacher enhancement program in 
              mathematics for 300  elementary and middle school teachers.   Starting in the
              first summer, all the teachers in Belleview,  IL will receive teacher
              enhancement, and successive groups  of teachers from surrounding districts will
              start in each of  the next two years.  For each teacher, the program will have 
              two summer components, 4-weeks and 2-weeks respectively,  with monthly full day
              seminars during the intervening school  year.  Community involvement includes
              business leaders,  parents, and district administrators.  District teachers 
              will be leaders, along with external specialists, in  carrying out the program.
               The request from NSF is  $2,038,699 over the three years with a cost-sharing
              amount  of $521,499.
