Abstract    :
              9355516  Kagan  Dr. V. Kagan is a faculty member at the Department of
              Environmental  and Occupational Health at the University of Pittsburgh.  He is
              a  world recognized leader in the field of free radical and  antioxidant
              research.  His current research program includes  extensive ESR studies of free
              radical mechanisms involved in the  activation of Ca2+ release channels in
              sarcoplasmic reticulum  membranes.  Dr. V. Ritov is the Associate Research
              Professor of  Biochemistry at the Department of Biology, State University of 
              Moscow.  With his systematic studies of Ca2+ transport and  mechanisms of its
              regulation, he has gained an outstanding  reputation as a biochemist.    The
              presence of Dr. Ritov in Dr. Kagan's laboratory at the  University of
              Pittsburgh on a daily basis will greatly facilitate  the joint studies on the
              involvement of free radicals and  antioxidants in fundamental physiologic
              mechanisms of functioning  of Ca2+-release channel in sarcoplasmic reticulum
              membranes.  Dr.  V. Ritov will have access to unique ESR techniques for free
              radical  studies developed in Dr. Kagan's laboratory which he will be able  to
              use in his research upon his return to Russia.  Dr. Ritov's  visit to the US
              will enable him to interact with American  scientists directly and will enhance
              his international scientific  reputation that he deserves.  The visit of Dr. V.
              Ritov to Dr.  Kagan's laboratory will significantly strengthen the
              collaborative  research in their laboratories both in the US and in Russia.
