Abstract    :
              9355551  Hollweg    The North American Association for Environmental Education
              VINE  Follow-Through Project builds on the existing VINE Program in which 
              youngster investigate ecological interactions occurring on their  school
              grounds.    VINE Follow-Through:  (1) Works with Leadership Teams in three 
              cities to design and test a set of strategies for developing  collaborative
              teams and leading professional development  initiatives.  The strategies are
              designed to enable teachers to  follow up on VINE investigations in a manner
              that will enable  students to do more science and construct meaning from their 
              experience.  (2) Documents those strategies and produces  professional
              development materials which can be used to apply this  model in additional
              settings.  (3) Evaluates this model for  building on informal science education
              experiences and promoting  science education reform, and assesses its potential
              for use in  conjunction with informal science education experiences offered 
              through science museums and other community-based institutions.    Each city's
              team includes five experienced teachers, a district  curriculum coordinator, a
              university science educator, an action  research expert, and a VINE project
              coordinator.  ***
