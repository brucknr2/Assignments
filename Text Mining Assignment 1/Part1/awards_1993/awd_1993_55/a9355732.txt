Abstract    :
              9355732  Schroder    This project of the Franklin Institute is based on a
              four-year  model that will improve inquiry-based science teaching throughout 
              Pennsylvania by establishing a statewide cadre of middle school  teacher
              leaders.  The Commonwealth Excellence in Science Teaching  Alliance (CESTA2)
              will provide these 120 teachers with a series  of intensive, professional
              development opportunities and  technical support that will enable them to: 
              improve their  knowledge of science content areas; apply science to real-world 
              situations; strengthen their ability to facilitate inquiry-based  science
              learning; and develop leadership skills for the  improvement of middle school
              science education.  Teams of two to  three teachers from each school will first
              focus on changing the  teaching of science in their building and then provide
              leadership  to their entire school district.  ***
