Abstract    :
              9355569  Crow    Participating in a series of three-week institutes and eight 
              academic year follow-up meetings, a core of 45 leader science  teachers from
              middle schools in the Houston Independent School  District will gain new skills
              in instructional practices, student  assessment, test and measurement
              statistics, and important related  science content.  This core group will then
              serve as workshop  leaders and as a human resource for their peers in their
              schools  and district.  The goal of this three-year project is to produce 
              assessment literate, subject matter competent teachers who can  implement
              authentic assessment of science, use the best science  teaching practices and
              provide the classroom environment needed to  achieve the goals specified by
              current science reforms such as  Project 2061, Scope Sequence and Coordination
              and the emerging  national standards.    The project uses a three part model
              that directly links the desired  goals for students, the behavior of the
              teacher (including  assessment), and the role of the student necessary to
              achieve these  goals.  Intertwined with this model is the need for teachers to 
              understand the targeted science concepts and relevant statistical  test
              measurements.  The project includes a research component to  assess its
              effectiveness and its impact on student learning.
