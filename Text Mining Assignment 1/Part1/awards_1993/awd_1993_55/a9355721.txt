Abstract    :
              9355721  Braile    This four year project serves ninety earth science teachers
              from  six midwestern states.  Each year thirty teachers will attend 4-  week
              intensive summer workshops, 2-weekend workshops during the  academic year, and
              a 1-day workshop at a national NSTA meeting.   The enhancement activities
              include:  improving their content  knowledge of current concepts and
              application of earth processes;  introducing skills through modern technology
              using computers;  taking an extended field trip in the midwest region; and
              practicing  presentations and other hands-on experiences.  The program takes 
              place in two parts with the summer teacher enhancement workshops  occurring
              during years 1, 2 and 3 while the academic year follow-up  occurs in years 2, 3
              and 4.    The central content theme of Earth processes is complemented by 
              activities which will prepare teachers to disseminate their  understanding of
              earth processes through the use of materials,  activities, and modeling
              teaching skills at local inservice  workshops and regional and national
              presentations.  Participants  will be required to conduct at least one
              inservice workshop for  their peers.  This will be facilitated by providing
              them with  guided grant writing experiences.  Participants may earn six 
              semester hours of course credit:  3-semester hours in the  Department of Earth
              and Atmospheric Sciences and 3-semester hours  in the Department of Curriculum
              and Instruction, all at Purdue  University.
