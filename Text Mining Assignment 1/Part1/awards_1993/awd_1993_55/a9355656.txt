Abstract    :
              9355656  Wolf         Lebanon Valley College and twelve school districts in 
              South-central Pennsylvania have initiated a science  education partnership
              affecting nearly 600 teachers and  20,000 students in grades 4-8.  The
              partnership goal is to  strengthen science teaching by increasing teachers' 
              knowledge of science, understanding of hands-on and inquiry-  learning
              pedagogies, and improving their skills to use  hands-on classroom materials.   
                    Training is achieved through summer institutes  organizing teachers,
              science faculty and students into  collaborative teams and by in-service
              workshops which  integrate approaches to science content, pedagogy, and 
              development of practical and useful classroom science  materials.  A cadre of
              teachers serve as Peer Leaders in  their districts, conducting workshops and
              institutes and  catalyzing their colleagues' long-term interest and  confidence
              in learning new science content and instructional  strategies.  A Resource
              Center is housed at the College.
