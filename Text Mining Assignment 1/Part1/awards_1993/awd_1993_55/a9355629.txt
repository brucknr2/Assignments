Abstract    :
              9355629  Chiss    This is a project of the Chicago Children's Museum to develop,
               evaluate and install a 2,200 square foot permanent exhibit called  "Inventing:
              The Process of Discovery."  This exhibit engages young  visitors (primarily
              from 6-10 yrs.) in inventive creativity,  testing, and development, and teaches
              them a meaningful sequence of  activities for problem-solving.  Museum
              educators and adolescent  interns act as multi-cultural role models in exhibit
              areas and  facilitate hands-on learning.     Every year the exhibit will serve
              over 500,000 children, parents  and teachers in Chicago's inner city and
              metropolitan  neighborhoods.  A large percentage of this audience is
              under-served  minority children drawn from CCM's alliances with diverse ethnic 
              community agencies.  This exhibit provides a safe haven where young 
              multi-cultural, often disadvantaged children  may find support for  science
              learning and be encouraged to grow and participate in the  many science fairs,
              science clubs, and invention conventions  available to adolescents in the
              Chicago area.  ***
