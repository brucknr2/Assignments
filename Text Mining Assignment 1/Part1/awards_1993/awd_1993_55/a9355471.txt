Abstract    :
              9355471  Vieux  The exchange will foster expanded collaborative activities
              through  the visit of Dr. Kaleta to the University of Oklahoma and the visit 
              of the PI to the Institute of Environmental Engineering.  Both  investigators
              will benefit from the exchange which will increase  the scientific
              infrastructure through expertise developed during  the two week visits.  Dr.
              Kaleta's visit will be timed to coincide  with the course taught on Air Quality
              Management.  He will be  providing several guest lectures on air quality in
              Poland.  This  interaction with students will provide an international theme to
              an  important topic in the U.S. and the world.  Dr. Kaleta will  participate in
              research activities in the Environmental Modeling  and GIS Laboratory which is
              under the PI's supervision.  These  activities will include air quality
              modeling and Geographic  Information System analyses.  The two week visit to
              Poland by Dr.  Vieux will foster collaboration with Polish colleagues at the 
              Institute of Environmental Engineering.  During this period Dr.  Vieux will
              help install air quality models and a Geographic  Information System on
              existing workstations at the Institute.  ***
