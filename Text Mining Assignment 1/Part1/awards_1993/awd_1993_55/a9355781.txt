              `         H                          9355781 Weiss  In 1990, the National
              Science Foundation (NSF) embarked on a new major initiative, the Statewide
              Systemic Initiative (SSI), to improve science and mathematics education K 12. 
              The approach of using a relatively small amount of federal dollars as leverage
              to move the states toward developing and implementing coordinated reform
              efforts has received national attention.  There is a great deal of interest in
              the progress of the SSI program among policy experts, education reformers, and
              the US Department of Education.   The project is a conference for a small group
              of policy experts, Statewide Systemic Initiatives (SSI) Principal
              Investigators, NSF program officers, and contractors to reflect, analyze, and
              synthesize from the collective experience and wisdom of all who are intimately
              involved in the SSI.  At the end of the conference, a monograph will be
              produced on what has been learned about statewide systemic change and the
              implications of that knowledge for the role of the federal, state, and local
              governments, among others, in supporting systemic change.  The conference will
              be held at the Wingspread Conference Center in Racine, Wisconsin.  The
              proposers, Dr. Iris Weiss, Horizon Research, Inc., Dr. Mark St. John of
              Inverness Research Associates, and Dr. Joy Frechtling of Westat, Inc., are
              highly qualified to conduct this grant.  Cost sharing in the amount of $30,171
              is included. ***
