Abstract    :
              9355508  Naegele    This project introduces high school physics teachers to
              recently  developed strategies for enhancing learning through the creative  use
              of computers, high tech sensors and real time data.  During the  three years of
              this project two groups of 24 physics teachers,  selected from the San
              Francisco Bay Area schools, will take part in  a two summer teacher enhancement
              program involving a total of six  weeks of instruction along with ten one-day
              workshops distributed  over two academic years.  Participant will have the
              opportunity to  fabricate some equipment of their own design based on their 
              curriculum needs.  During the academic year, special workshops for 
              participants will be conducted by faculty from nationally  recognized MBL
              facilities.  Each participant will receive a variety  of teaching materials and
              $400 in interfacing equipment for use in  their respective schools. 
              Participants may earn 16 units of  academic credit.
