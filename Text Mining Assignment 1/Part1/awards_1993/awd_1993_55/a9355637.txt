Abstract    :
              9355637  Hanson    The Children's Museum is requesting $910,088 from the
              National  Science Foundation to create an exhibition to go in an Urban 
              Environmental Center to be built on a barge anchored in Fort Point  Channel, a
              500-foot-wide Boston Harbor waterway in front of the  Museum.  Our goal is to
              create exhibits which broaden public access  to the process of science while
              extending each person's awareness  of an engagement in this particular
              waterfront environment.    Barge exhibits are focused on water, which has
              universal appeal to  children and is the central feature of our location;
              atmosphere --  birds, sun, solar radiation, shadow, light refraction and 
              diffraction, heat, wind, and clouds; built environment --  architecture,
              engineering, buildings, technology -- and their  relationship to living things.
               We will provide a wide menu of  entry-level approaches to the environment that
              are not given in  school.  The exhibits will take a visitor from where s/he is
              at the  beginning of the visit to a new level of curiosity and concern.   
              Through observation and direct experimentation, children will see  what varies
              with the tides, what flows into the Channel from street  run-off, where
              different creatures nest, what is emitted into the  atmosphere from cars and
              buildings, and many other things.  Some  exhibits invite a playful experience,
              involving the senses and  whole body; others offer a more focused exploration
              to uncover  principles of a phenomenon.  All encourage practice in such 
              scientific processes as observing, collecting, recording, and  comparing data.
