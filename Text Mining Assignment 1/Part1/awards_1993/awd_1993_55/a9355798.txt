Abstract    :
              9355798  Watson    This project supports a conference sponsored by the
              Association of  State Supervisors of Mathematics for those state officers who
              are  involved in the selection of candidates for the Presidential Awards  for
              Excellence in Science and Mathematics Teaching (PAESMT).  These  people will
              discuss the following issues: (1) implementing the new  state award program;
              (2) planning for the decade year of the  program; (3) establishing a data base
              on the awardees; (4)  exploring the use of video-taping in the selection
              process; (5)  developing an electronic networking system for the awardees; (6) 
              generating leadership capability among the awardees; (7) seeking  consistency
              among states and jurisdictions in the application and  nomination process; and
              (8) expansion of the pool of candidates for  the program especially to
              encourage more applications from  minority, urban and rural teachers.  Based
              upon the recommendations  of the conference participants, the state PAESMT
              coordinators will  implement the necessary changes to improve the effectiveness
              of the  Program for their state.
