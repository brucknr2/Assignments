Abstract    :
              9304680  Hodges       The Himalayan Orogen is the classic example of an  active
              continent-continent collision and has received  considerable study.  In
              addition to major thrust systems,  extensional features are present at high
              structural levels,  possibly accommodating gravitational collapse of steep 
              topographic gradients, thus indicating that the Himalaya is  a dynamic system
              that has undergone several episodes of  adjustment in response to changes in
              the stress field,  thermal structure or other tectonic parameters.  This 
              project will test the hypothesis that syn-compressional  collapse was episodic
              in the orogen by dating appropriate  deformational features.   The project will
              also develop  linked thermal and mechanical models based on the  accumulated
              geological database for the central Himalaya.  This model, specific to this
              orogen, is expected to have  considerable relevance to the understanding of
              complex  dynamics of collisional orogens in general.
