Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              There are clear suggestions that elements of the diet influence                
              the physiology of reproduction in primates, including humans.                  
              Some plant chemicals mimic the actions of animal steroids and                  
              therefore may directly influence reproductive function and even                
              development.                                                                   
                                                                                             
              This project will develop a set of methods appropriate for                     
              investigating these actions in a natural setting.  The                         
              investigator will develop three lines of analysis.  First, she                 
              will directly assay phytochemical in plants foods eaten by humans              
              and primates.  Second, she will attempt to develop a steroid                   
              analysis reproductive function in natural populations via fecal                
              steroid analysis, validating these results by comparing them with              
              serum profiles.  The third line of analysis will relate                        
              phytochemical intake to reproductive responses.
