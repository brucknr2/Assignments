Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal is a request for funds to support student                        
              participants at the 1993 Northeast Regional Conference on                      
              Developmental Biology.  The Conference will be held at the Marine              
              Biological Laboratory (MBL), Woods Hole, Massachusetts, on the                 
              weekend of March 12-14, 1993.  The general goal of this conference             
              is to bring together a broad range of developmental biologists, at             
              various stages in their careers, to present and discuss their                  
              research in formal and informal settings.  As in past conferences,             
              an attempt will be made to integrate research on plant and animal              
              developmental biology to enhance communication between groups that             
              traditionally have been separated.  The 1993 conference will                   
              include four formal platform sessions and two poster sessions, as              
              well as two featured presentations by prominent developmental                  
              biologists.  There will be ample time for informal discussions                 
              during the mixers and poster sessions, and during the meals, which             
              will be in MBL's dining hall.  One of the attractive features of               
              this conference is that it provides students, postdoctoral fellows,            
              and junior faculty with the opportunity to present their work to a             
              diverse group of developmental biologists in a supportive congenial            
              atmosphere.  Accordingly, the established investigators chairing               
              the platform sessions are encouraged to solicit presentations from             
              graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior faculty, and               
              all graduate students attending the meeting are encouraged to                  
              present their work in the poster sessions.  Abstracts will be                  
              published in The Biological Bulletin.
