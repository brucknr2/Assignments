Abstract    :
              Infrared spectroscopic measurements demonstrate that                           
              hydrogen is structurally bound within all of the major                         
              "anhydrous" mantle minerals as an OH- for O= substitution in                   
              the crystal lattice.  This substitution may represent the                      
              primary storage mechanism for water in the upper mantle.                       
              This proposal seeks to carry out analyses on a variety of                      
              samples to determine the hydrogen isotopic composition of                      
              nominally anhydrous minerals in relation to other                              
              geochemical parameters.  These results will provide insights                   
              into the nature of water in the mantle and will set                            
              constraints on the earth's degassing, water recycling, and                     
              the conditions associated with the formation of a variety of                   
              mantle suites.
