Abstract    :
              This is a proposal to study the petrogenesis of mantle                         
              eclogites and the dynamics of their emplacement within the                     
              framework of the evolution of ancient sub-cratonic mantle                      
              and the early evolution of the Earth.  In this proposed                        
              research, work concerning two localities  will continue, and                   
              study extended to two additional kimberlite localities in                      
              Yakutia, Siberia.  These occurrences are postulated to have                    
              sampled a wide range of depths in the mantle and are                           
              situated at varying distances from the craton edge.  The                       
              proposed study would continue the NSF-sponsored US/Russia                      
              Cooperative Research Program and agreement between Prof.                       
              L.A. Taylor of the University of Tennessee and Academician                     
              N.V.  Sobolev of the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy                    
              of Sciences.  This multi-national approach will include                        
              petrographic and mineral-chemical analyses of selected                         
              xenoliths from the aforementioned kimberlite pipes in                          
              Siberia.  This study will include an exchange of scientific                    
              personnel between the United States and Russia.  O, Rb-Sr,                     
              Sm-Nd, and Re-Os analyses will be performed on mineral                         
              separates in diamonds to determine the involvement of mantle                   
              and crustal reservoirs in eclogite genesis.  A new and                         
              exciting direction involves a study of major- and trace-                       
              element chemistry of eclogite minerals found in several of                     
              the Yakutian diamonds.  The results will be used to achieve                    
              a more complete and global picture of the formation of                         
              mantle eclogites, the structure and evolution of old                           
              cratons, and the differentiation of the early Earth.
