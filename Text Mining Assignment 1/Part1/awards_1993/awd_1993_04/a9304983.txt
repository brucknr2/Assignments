Abstract    :
              9304983  Cavener  The cap-dependent scanning model for translation initiation in
               eukaryotes was previously argued to be used by all eukaryotic  mRNAs. 
              Recently the poliovirus, EMCV, immunoglobulin binding  protein, and Drosophila
              Antennapedia mRNAs were shown to use a  novel cap-independent mechanism for
              translation initiation in  cultured cells.  These mRNAs contain internal
              ribosome entry the  sites (IRES) in their 5' untranslated region (UTR) leader 
              sequences.  This proposal will examine the developmental regulation  of
              internal initiation using transgenic Drosophila.  The 5" UTR  sequences of the
              Antennapedia (Antp), Ultrabithorax (Ubx), and  seven in absentia (sina) will be
              tested for IRES activity using a  dicistronic assay system.  The ability
              translation of the distal  cistron will be assessed in transgenic Drosophila. 
              Since the  dicistronic gene will be driven by a constitutive promoter, the 
              potential translation by the internal initiation mechanism can be  assessed for
              all tissues and stages.  Internal deletion experiments  will examine whether
              the putative IRES elements of Antp, Ubx, and  sina are necessary for
              translation in the context of their full 5'  UTRs.    %%%  Initiation of
              protein synthesis in eukaryotes is preceded by a  series of complex reactions
              primarily involving the ribosome,  initiation factors, Net-tRNA, and a mRNA. 
              The cap dependent  scanning model was proposed by Kozak in 1989 to explain the
              order  and nature of these reactions.  It was first challenged by the 
              discovery that the picornaviruses do not have a terminal cap and  are
              translated by internal ribosome binding.  This work will  examine the
              developmental regulation of internal initiation using  transgenic Drosophila
              and should allow insight into the elucidation  of alternative initiation
              mechanisms and also to a possible mode of  development gene regulation.  ***
