Abstract    :
              9304939  Kerrick    Collisional orogenesis may provide a climatically important
              source  of CO2, thus requiring a re-examination of the role of mountain 
              building and orogenic metamorphism in long-term global change.  The  elevated
              paleoatmospheric CO2 levels proposed for the Eocene may  have resulted from CO2
              released during Eocene regional metamorphism  that affected extensive segments
              of the Tethys and Circum-Pacific  orogenic belts.  Based on the geologic
              record, the regional  metamorphism in the Tethyan Himalayan orogen alone may
              have  provided enough CO2 to produce a significant Eocene climatic impact.  
              The quantities and fluxes of CO2 released to the atmosphere by  decarbonation
              reactions in carbonate and carbonaceous lithologies  (e.g., siliceous
              dolomites, marls, black shales) during prograde  regional metamorphism
              represents a much neglected problem.  From  estimates of the size of the
              Himalayan orogen affected by Eocene  metamorphism, the proportion of
              metacarbonate and graphitic rocks  involved in this metamorphism, and
              geochronologic analysis of the  duration of prograde metamorphism, and Eocene
              atmosphere could have  received a large flux of metamorphic CO2 (> 1019
              moles/Ma).   Geochronologic analyses reveal a remarkable similarity in peak 
              metamorphic ages (i.e., 40-50 Ma) for many areas within the Tethys  and
              Circum-Pacific orogens, thus supporting the concept of a major,  world-wide
              Eocene regional metamorphism.  There are two primary  thrusts of our proposed
              interdisciplinary research:  (1) analysis  of the geologic record to quantify
              the amount and rate of  metamorphic CO2 production during the Eocene, and (2)
              modeling the  impact of metamorphic CO2 fluxes on the Eocene atmosphere.  ***
