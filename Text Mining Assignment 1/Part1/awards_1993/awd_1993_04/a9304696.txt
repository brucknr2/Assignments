Abstract    :
                   This project is directed towards the study of infinite                    
              dimensional balanced realizations, both from the point of view of              
              improving the basic understanding of these realizations and of                 
              providing further tools for model reductions of infinite                       
              dimensional systems. The project will focus on the specific                    
              questions of asymptotic and exponential stability of the balanced              
              systems and the boundedness properties of the system operators. A              
              further important point which will be addressed is the issue of                
              whether general Trotter-Kato type convergence results can                      
              be proved for the balanced approximation scheme.                               
                   Many engineering systems, such as highly flexible                         
              mechanical systems, inherently contain infinitely many degrees of              
              freedom and therefore any accurate mathematical description of                 
              such a system must necessarily be infinite dimensional. There                  
              are several ways to achieve such a mathematical description.                   
              One recent approach is based on models of finite complexity.                   
              This method of "balanced realizations" has proved very successful              
              in practice.
