Abstract    :
              Abramovitch    9304094    This award will support collaborative research 
              between Rudolph Abramovitch, Clemson University, and  A. P. Rauter, University
              of Lisbon, Portugal.  This  project will develop the synthesis of   (i) medium
              ring homologs of known flavonoids and  flavanols and (ii) macrocyclic diphenyl
              ether  lactones related to known naturally occurring ring  synthesis, e.g.
              Combrestastin D-2.      The research strengths of the two participants are 
              complementary.  Dr. Rauter's work on the chemistry  of flavonoids has provided
              a basis for synthesizing  medium ring homologs of flavonoids and flavanols.  
              Dr. Abramovitch's on cyclizations using nitrenium  ions provides a methodology
              permitting novel and  ready access.  The Portuguese part of the project  will
              explore whether ketones (or enols) can trap  arylnitrenium ions to form C-O-C
              bonds.  The Clemson  study will explore whether molecular modelling  studies
              (MMX and AM1) can predict which starting  materials have the right geometry to
              undergo  macrocyclizations.    ***
