Abstract    :
              High precision isotopic ratio measurements and trace and                       
              major element concentrations will be used to study                             
              fundamental processes of mantle differentiation and                            
              dynamical behavior.  Our project addresses the timescales                      
              and trace element behavior associated with melt generation                     
              in the upper mantle, using coupled U-Th and Sm-Nd                              
              systematics in oceanic and continental basalts.  A                             
              systematic data set will be assembled so that the competing                    
              effects of melt fraction and transport time can be                             
              evaluated.  The ultimate objective is to improve the                           
              understanding of melt generation and trace element                             
              partitioning behavior, so that geochemical data can be more                    
              confidently applied in the study of solid earth geochemical                    
              cycles.  A second project addresses the geochemical                            
              signatures of oceanic flood basalt provinces, using the                        
              Wrangellia Terrane basalts, to evaluate the relative                           
              contributions of plume heterogeneity, and lithosphere-                         
              asthenosphere contamination, on the isotopic signatures of                     
              plume-head volcanic products.  The ultimate objective of the                   
              second study is to better constrain plume provenance, and                      
              thereby evaluate models for the evolution of the lowermost                     
              mantle.  The research involves filed characterization of                       
              geological features, sampling, laboratory chemical and                         
              isotopic analysis, and the development of numerical process                    
              models to identify the controlling physical parameters and                     
              quantify the constraints imposed by the data base.
