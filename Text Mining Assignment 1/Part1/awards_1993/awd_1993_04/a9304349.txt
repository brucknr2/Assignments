Abstract    :
                   This award provides 56% of the funds required for the purchase            
              of a modern atomic absorption spectrometer that will be installed,             
              operated, and maintained in the Department of Geology and                      
              Geophysics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The University              
              is committed to providing the remaining funds needed for the                   
              acquisition of this equipment.                                                 
                   The instrument will be used primarily in the research programs            
              of the Principal Investigator and colleagues that are focused on               
              the chemistry of groundwaters and hydrothermal solutions.
