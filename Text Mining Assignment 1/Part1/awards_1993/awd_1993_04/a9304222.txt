Abstract    :
              The Phase 1 of the project                                                     
              investigated basic assumptions used                                            
              in hurricane risk assessment, with                                             
              emphasis on developing and

              models.  A new windfield model,                                                
              based on the results of a numerical                                            
              hurricane boundary layer model, was                                            
              developed with gust factor

              hurricanes.  The model includes the                                            
              effect of storm translation in a

              hurricane windspeeds at Miami and

              These simulations indicate that the

              particularly in the New York area,
