Abstract    :
                   Douglas will study the connection between problems in operator            
              theory on one hand and algebraic and analytic geometry in the                  
              presence of a hermitian metric.  The goal is to understand multi-              
              variate phenomena and to provide techniques to study more general              
              cases.  He will also investigate various invariants for elliptic               
              operators on manifolds.  Starting from the case of elliptic                    
              operators on compact, smooth manifolds without boundary which is               
              now classical, one is seeking to understand what happens when these            
              hypothesis are relaxed.                                                        
                   The general area of mathematics of this project has its basis             
              in the theory of algebras of Hilbert space operators.  Operators               
              can be thought of as finite or infinite matrices of complex                    
              numbers.  Special types of operators are often put together in an              
              algebra, naturally called an operator algebra.  These abstract                 
              objects have a surprising variety of applications.  For example,               
              they play a key role in knot theory, which in turn is currently                
              being used to study the structure of DNA, and they are of                      
              fundamental importance in noncommutative geometry, which is                    
              becoming increasingly important in physics.
