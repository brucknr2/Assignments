Abstract    :
                   This award will provide 52% of the funds required for the                 
              upgrade of the electron microprobe instrument operated by the                  
              Department of Earth & Planetary Sciences at Washington University.             
              The University is committed to providing the remaining funds needed            
              for the upgrade.                                                               
                   The microanalytical quantitative analysis capabilities of the             
              electron microprobe is used by a large number of researchers and               
              their students at Washington University in research projects in                
              petrology, the crustal evolution of West Greenland, lunar and                  
              terrestrial volcanic petrology, and materials science. In addition,            
              the microprobe laboratory is available as a regional facility to               
              investigators (including students) from the PEW Consortium colleges            
              (Beloit, Carleton, Grinnell, Hope, Kalamazoo, Knox, Macalester,                
              Rhodes, St. Olaf, and Trinity), and other institutions including               
              Saint Louis University, U of Missouri-Rolla, U of Missouri-                    
              Columbia, University of Arkansas, and Auburn University.
