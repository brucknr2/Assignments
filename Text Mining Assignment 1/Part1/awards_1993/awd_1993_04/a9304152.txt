Abstract    :
              9304152  Pui    The proposed study deals with experimental and theoretical 
              investigations of aerosol charging by ions and free electrons in  the
              transition and free-molecule regimes.  It is aimed to resolve  existing
              discrepancies between theories and experiments.  Aerosol  charging and the
              subsequent manipulation of the particles in an  electric field are effective
              means of measuring, classifying and  collecting them.  The project will first
              focus on developing an  aerosol charger of low particle-loss, capable of
              operating under  vacuum and in high purity gases.  It will be followed by 
              experimental studies of aerosol charging by ions and free  electrons.  Aerosol
              charge distributions will be measured.  This  method of testing charging
              theories is more sensitive than the  traditional charged fraction measurement. 
              A numerical solution to  the Boltzmann collision equation will be obtained to
              compare with  the existing theories and with data obtained.    The results of
              this study should provide a better understanding of  fundamental transfer
              processes and the needed knowledge base  towards improving the collection
              efficiency of electrostatic  precipitations in the air pollution  control
              industry, measuring  and classifying nanometer  particles in the materials
              industry, and  controlling particulate contaminants in plasma reactors in the 
              microelectronics industry.  ***
