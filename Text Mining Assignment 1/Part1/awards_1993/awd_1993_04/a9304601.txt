Abstract    :
              9304601  Ross       A loss network consists of a collection of resources to
              which  calls arrive at random times.  An arriving call is accepted into  the
              network when sufficient resources are available; otherwise is  lost.  An
              accepted call sojourns in the network for the duration of  its holding time
              which is also random.  This research will include  original work in the area of
              loss networks including the  development of:  exact and approximative
              mathematical methodologies  for solving large loss networks; loss-network
              models for  telecommunication applications such as telephone networks with 
              state-dependent routing, mobile cellular radio; and ATM at the  connection
              layer.  ***
