Abstract    :
              9304896  Sereno       By the end of the Triassic Period, a major transition in 
              terrestrial vertebrate communities had occurred with the  replacement of
              therapsid-dominated faunas by dinosaur-dominated  faunas that would persist
              until the end of the Mesozoic.   Fossiliferous deposits in northwestern
              Argentina provide a unique  opportunity to study this faunal transition at a
              fine stratigraphic  scale within a radiometrically dated framework.  In this
              study PI  will oversee preparation of the complete skeleton of the important 
              new early dinosaur, Eoraptor lunensis, and also generate more  radiometric
              dates of the enclosing strata of this dinosaur.  This  work will shed light on
              an important point in tetrapod evolution.
