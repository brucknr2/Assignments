Abstract    :
              9304573  Stute         Groundwater circulating in extended confined aquifers
              contains  information on past climates.  Noble gas measurements, in 
              particular, allow reconstruction of continental paleotemperatures  ('noble gas
              paleothermometer').  Cl- and isotopic data (D), 18O)  provide additional
              insight into long-term climate change.  This  award supports the collection and
              evaluation of geochemical data  (He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe, 14C, 13C D, 18O, 36Cl and
              major dissolved ions)  from two groundwater flow systems in the southern
              hemisphere, the  Stampriet aquifer in Namibia and the Dilwyn aquifer in
              southern  Australia.  Paleoclimate records from these aquifers will address 
              the relationship between continental and oceanic paleotemperatures  and the
              latitudinal symmetry of climate change during the past  30,000 years.
