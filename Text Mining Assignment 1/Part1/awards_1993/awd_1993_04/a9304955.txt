Abstract    :
              The aims of this proposal are to: (1) identify the exposed and                 
              chemically susceptible amino acid residues on the PSII polypeptides            
              after various treatments to selectively remove extrinsic proteins              
              and heterogeneous Mn clusters, (2) identify protein domains capable            
              of being x-linked, (3) characterize the structure of a possible                
              extrinsic domain hetero-trimer complex, and (4) use vibrational                
              spectroscopy and circular dichroism to predict the overall                     
              secondary structure of each extrinsic protein.

              Water oxidation (oxygen evolution) during photosynthesis is one of             
              the key reactions for all the living creatures on this planet.  The            
              studies proposed will characterize the interactions among the                  
              proteins involved in oxygen evolution in spinach.  In contributing             
              to an understanding of protein-protein and protein-metal ion                   
              interactions in living systems these studies may lead to the                   
              discovery of approaches to the formation of synthetic complexes                
              capable of multielectron catalysis on large scales.
