Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Alternative computer input devices are a critical component of                 
              the important role computer technology plays in meeting the needs              
              of individuals with disabilities or other challenges.  In                      
              February 1992, a special alternative computer keyboard,                        
              IntelliKeys, was given the coveted first prize in The Johns                    
              Hopkins University National Search for Computing to Assist                     
              Persons with Disabilities.  Results of the Phase I Small Business              
              Innovation Research (SBIR) study by the creators of Intellikeys                
              establish the technical basis for the development custom overlays              
              for IntelliKeys, a new set of educational tools that has as its                
              purpose increasing the accessibility of computers and computer                 
              software for individuals with disabilities.  The research                      
              objectives of the Phase II study focus on (1) identifying the                  
              characteristics of effective custom overlays; and (2) developing               
              and testing materials based upon those characteristics, including              
              custom mathematics and science overlays; mathematics and science               
              Curriculum Activity Booklets; and a teachers' "how-to" manual so               
              that teachers will be able to create their own curriculum-based                
              custom overlays that will be of maximum benefit to each                        
              particular student.  The project will make an important                        
              contribution to the mandate of Public Law 94-142 which stipulates              
              that to the greatest degree possible students with disabilities                
              should have access to educational opportunities equal to those of              
              their able-bodied peers.
