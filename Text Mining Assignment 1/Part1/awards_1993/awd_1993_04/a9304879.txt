Abstract    :
                   Methods of analysis in structural geology parallel in                     
              many ways other fields of                                                      
              design.  For example, geologists are interested in                             
              describing quantitatively the                                                  
              3-D form and history of deformed rocks and structures.                         
              Because of the                                                                 
              complexities of natural systems, conventional methods for                      
              such endeavors require                                                         
              massive computer support and are generally beyond most                         
              investigators.  This                                                           
              project seeks to examine the theoretical basis and practical                   
              implementation of                                                              
              Bezier tools for structural geology.  Such tools have the                      
              potential of                                                                   
              revolutionizing this field because of their computational                      
              economy, i.e.,                                                                 
              structures can be described in simpler terms than can                          
              conventional techniques.                                                       
              Practical implementation of these tools has been slow,                         
              however, and has thus not                                                      
              reached the large pool of potential users, save for                            
              scientists employed by                                                         
              well-heeled industrial concerns.  This proposal seeks to                       
              examine the utility of                                                         
              Bezier tools for structural geology and to bring these                         
              methods to the mainstream                                                      
              through the development of public domain software.
