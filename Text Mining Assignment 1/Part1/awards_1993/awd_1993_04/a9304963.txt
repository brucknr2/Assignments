Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The University of Rhode Island has operated the R/V ENDEAVOR              
              as a general purpose oceanographic research vessel since 1976.                 
              During this time the vessel has operated as an effective platform              
              for a wide variety of NSF-sponsored research projects. In 1993 the             
              ENDEAVOR will not operate. The ship will undergo a mid-life refit              
              during his time. It is estimated that the refit itself will take               
              about 6 months in a shipyard. The remainder of the year, before and            
              after the shipyard period, will be used to maintain and upgrade the            
              ship and science systems on the vessel. Documentation of system and            
              computerized maintenance planning will be important aspects of the             
              mid-life.  The overhaul, upgrade and mid-life planned for the                  
              vessel will result in a more capable, cost effective and efficient             
              ship for supporting the oceanographic research needs of the                    
              National Science Foundation for the remainder of the ENDEAVOR's                
              operating life.
