Abstract    :
                This research is to investigate and model anomalous particle                 
              motions and coda of seismic body waves received at broad-band                  
              TERRAscope stations in the active seismic region of southern                   
              California.  These effects are believed to be due to lateral                   
              heterogeneity, including faults, near the stations.  Understanding             
              the effects of lateral velocity heterogeneity is essential for                 
              evaluating errors in waveform modeling using simple 1-D earth                  
              models and determining wave scattering mechanisms within the                   
              lithosphere.  The anomalous observations themselves may be useful              
              in inferring constraints on the type and magnitude of                          
              heterogeneity.  Data from all available TERRAscope stations will               
              be investigated for inference of lateral heterogeneity.  In                    
              addition to velocity heterogeneity due to geologic structure,                  
              effects of topography will be investigated to determine if                     
              topography plays a major role in formation of P wave coda and the              
              interpretation of the P waveform particle motions.  This research              
              is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
