Abstract    :
              9304480  Coleman  This United States-Russian multidisciplinary cooperative 
              research project will involve field, petrologic,  geochronologic and tectonic
              investigations of intracratonal  metamorphic rocks in the Kokchetav Massif and
              the Maksyutov  Complex of the Ural Mountains.  Microdiamonds and/or  coesite,
              which form during regional ultrahigh-P metamorphism  at mantle depths, have
              been described from these rocks -  their presence in regionally extensive
              complexes at the  Earth's surface may imply the operation of  tectonic 
              processes of profound importance.   Specific goals of the  research include
              identifying and characterizing the  composition of crystalline inclusions in
              garnet and zircon  to establish the conditions of the ultrahigh metamorphism, 
              delineating the P-T-t paths of various rocks, determining  the geochemical
              characteristics of protoliths, and  establishing ages of  the metamorphic
              events through  radiometric dating.
