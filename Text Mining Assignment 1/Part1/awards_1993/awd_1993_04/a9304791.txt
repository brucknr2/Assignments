Abstract    :
              9304791  Getting    The PIs  will study the mechanisms and kinetic laws of the 
              olivine-spinel transformation of the composition fayalite  Fe2SiO4.  This
              experimental program will exploit the unique  capabilities of a gas
              piston-cylinder apparatus at the University  of Colorado.  This device offers
              extremely well known hydrostatic  pressure in a range previously inaccessible. 
              Differentia  stresses can also be well characterized.  The goal is to improve 
              understanding of the processes of phase change in ferromagnesian  minerals in
              subducting slabs and to develop greater insight into  the physics of
              transformational faulting.
