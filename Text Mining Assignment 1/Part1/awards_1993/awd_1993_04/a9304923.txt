Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Stable carbon isotopes in paleosol carbonate show that C4 tropical             
              grasses expanded rapidly onto the floodplains of the Indo-Gangetic             
              Plain starting about 7.3 Ma.  At about the same time, C4 grasses               
              began their expansion in East Africa.  Carbon isotope evidence from            
              fossil teeth from the midwestern U.S. suggests a latest Miocene (8             
              to 6 Ma) date for the appearance of C4 grasses there as well.  Our             
              intent here is to date and quantify the radiation of C4 grasses                
              across the Americas by detailed sampling of paleosols and fossil               
              teeth from sections in New Mexico, USA, and in La Rioja and San                
              Juan Provinces in NW Argentina.  If the C4 expansion is related to             
              onset or strengthening of the Asian Monsoon, as has been previously            
              suggested, then we would not expect expansion in the Americas and              
              the Old World to be synchronous.  If the expansion is synchronous,             
              then some other explanation involving a global change, such as                 
              reduction in atmospheric pCO2 or other causes, must be invoked.
