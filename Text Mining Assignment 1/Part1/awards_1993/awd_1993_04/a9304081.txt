Abstract    :
              9304081  Abello  This project is concerned with the problem of deciding if a 
              given graph is the visibility graph of a simple polygon on the  plane.  This
              problem is known to be in PSPACE but it is not  known to be NP-HARD.  In fact
              even proving membership in NP  appears to be non trivial.  A novel approach to
              studying  properties of visibility graphs of simple polygons is being  pursued
              based on the result that visibility graphs of simple  polygons can be derived
              in a purely combinatorial manner from  the representations of their underlying
              point configurations  by chains in the weak Bruhat order of the symmetric
              group.    One of the objectives is to obtain a characterization of  visibility
              graphs of simple polygons in terms of a class of  graphs derived from chains in
              the weak Bruhat order of the  symmetric group.  Such a characterization would
              prove  membership in NP and also provide a purely combinatorial  algorithm for
              the visibility graph recognition problem.  In  addition, the combinatorial and
              algorithmic relationships  between visibility graph recognition and fundamental
              problems  in Computational Synthetic geometry, such as oriented matroid 
              representation and circular sequence realization are being  explored.
