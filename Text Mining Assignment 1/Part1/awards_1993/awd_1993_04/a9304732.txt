Abstract    :
                   This awards supports the research of Professor I. Dolgachev               
              to work in algebraic geometry.  Professor Dolgachev will study                 
              relations between invariants and vector bundles. He also intends to            
              study problems related to instantons and moduli spaces of vector               
              bundles.                                                                       
                   This research is in the field of algebraic geometry, one of               
              the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which blossomed to             
              the point where it has, in the past 10 years, solved problems that             
              have stood for centuries. Originally, it treated figures defined in            
              the plane by the simplest of equations, namely polynomials. Today,             
              the field uses methods not only from algebra, but also from                    
              analysis and topology, and conversely it is extensively used in                
              those fields.  Moreover it has proved itself useful in fields as               
              diverse as physics, theoretical computer science, cryptography,                
              coding theory and robotics.
