Abstract    :
              9304526  Wolber  It is proposed to determine the x-ray crystal structures of a 
              homeodomain heterodimer, a1/alpha2, bound to DNA and of a mutant  alpha2
              homeodomain bound to DNA.  Obtaining high quality crystals  is the essential
              first step in determining an atomic structure  using x-ray crystallography. 
              Since there are no previous examples  of crystals of multiprotein complexes
              bound to DNA, the results of  this work are certain to be of relevance to
              future studies of other  DNA-protein ternary complexes.  %%%  An important
              feature of gene regulation in eukaryotes is the  central role played by
              multiprotein complexes that bind DNA and  control mRNA transcription.  The
              proposed studies will yield an  atomic level picture of one such protein-DNA
              complex, that  involving the a1/alpha2 protein complex and DNA.  The insights 
              gained from the structure of this ternary complex as well as that  of a mutant
              alpha2 protein bound to DNA, will be of great  significance to an understanding
              of how all members of the  homeodomain family regulate gene expression.  ***
