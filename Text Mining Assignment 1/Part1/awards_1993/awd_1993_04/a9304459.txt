Abstract    :
              9304459  Pessagno       PIs will: 1) integrate radiolarian and other
              microfossils with  ammonite and Buchia biostratigraphy in order to place the
              Jurassic-  Cretaceous boundary in selected sections in North America (CA, 
              Mexico); 2) establish magnetostratigraphy and relate it to  biostratigraphy in
              these sections; 3) relate biozones to  geochronometric data; and 4) examine Sr
              isotope values in these  sections.  Samples will be collected from Kimmeridgian
              to  Valanginian strata and farmed out to experts on ammonites and  microfossils
              other than radiolarians and forams.  This work will  aid in defining the J/K
              boundary, and contribute to a more accurate  ammonite-based chronostratigraphic
              calibration of North American  radiolarian zonation.
