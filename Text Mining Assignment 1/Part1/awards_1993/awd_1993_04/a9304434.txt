Abstract    :
              A study is proposed of the microscopic sulfur isotopic                         
              variability of sulfide and anhydrite crystals in the                           
              eruption products of recent SO2-rich volcanic eruptions (El                    
              Chichon, Nevado del Ruiz, Mt. Pinatubo).  Anhydrite is now                     
              recognized as an important phase in the eruption products of                   
              many SO2-rich silicic magmas, but questions still remain                       
              about the juvenile vs. xenocrystic nature of the anhydrite                     
              and the mechanism of  SO2 release from the melt.  The                          
              answers to these questions require data on the sulfur                          
              isotopic composition of anhydrite and sulfide crystals in                      
              the eruption products.  The SHRIMP is an ideal tool to apply                   
              to these problems.  Preliminary SHRIMP results rule out                        
              formation of all anhydrite in a single-stage magmatic                          
              crystallization process.  The SHRIMP will be used to assess                    
              whether anhydrite is generally of mixed origins in these                       
              eruptions.  The study will help constrain pre-eruptive magma                   
              S chemistry and degassing behavior, as well as resolve                         
              whether fortuitous  remobilization of pre-existing                             
              extraneous sulfur is a critical component of past and                          
              present volcanic eruptions which injected significant                          
              amounts of climate-altering SO2 into the atmosphere.
