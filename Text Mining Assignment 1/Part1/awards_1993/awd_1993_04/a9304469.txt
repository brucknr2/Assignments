Abstract    :
              9304469  Shoelson  Growth factor/insulin stimulation of the respective tyrosine
              kinase  receptors results in the physical assembly of macromolecular  protein
              complexes at the cytoplasmic surface of the cell membrane.   These
              protein-protein associations are mediated by interactions  between
              phosphoproteins and additional cytoplasmic proteins having  Src-homology 2
              (SH2) domains (ca.100 residue, modular  phosphotyrosine binding pockets). 
              Recently several methods were  developed to analyze structure/function
              relationships between  intact phosphoproteins and SH2 domain proteins and
              truncated  versions of both.  These findings suggest that phosphoprotein 
              interactions with PI 3-kinase SH2 domains might regulate enzyme  function by 
              an allosteric mechanism.  This project proposes to  extend these observations
              and determine whether SH2 domain  occupancy is a generalized mechanism for
              regulating catalytic  activity.  Two members of each SH2 protein class will be
              analyzed:  tyrosine kinases Src & Lck, other enzymes PLC-gamma & SH-PTP, and 
              putative linkers PI 3-kinase p85 & Crk.      %%%  Many growth factors and
              related hormones like insulin activate  receptors with intrinsic protein
              tyrosine kinase activity to elicit  a wide range of biochemical responses,
              which ultimately lead to  changes in cellular differentiation, metabolism,
              morphology and  proliferation.  These studies explore how a class of soluble 
              proteins called SH2 domain proteins contributes to the regulation  of signal
              transduction mediated by these hormones and growth  factors.  ***
