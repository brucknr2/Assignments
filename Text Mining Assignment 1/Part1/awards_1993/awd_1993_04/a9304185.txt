Abstract    :
              9304185  Stuber       The principal investigator (PI) will develop new code
              design  criteria, and identify trellis codes and interleaving techniques  that
              are effective for multipath fading ISI channels.  In addition  the PI will
              develop new reduced complexity receiver structures for  performing diversity
              combining, equalization, and trellis decoding,  along with suitable channel
              estimation techniques.  Sequence  estimators that are based on the Viterbi
              algorithm and the Fano  algorithm are of particular interest.  Finally the PI
              will derive  tighter upper bounds on the error probability of receivers that 
              employ joint equalization and decoding.  The approaches that will  be used in
              this study involve a mixture of theoretical work in  channel modeling, signal
              processing, and coding theory as well as  computation and simulation on
              workstations.  ***
