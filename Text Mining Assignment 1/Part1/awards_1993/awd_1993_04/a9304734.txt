Abstract    :
              9304734  Trinkle  This is the first year of a three year continuing award.  The 
              research addresses automatic planning for robotic systems  performing contact
              tasks with movable objects in uncertain  environments.  Tasks in this class
              include mechanical assembly  operations, dexterous manipulation, and fine
              motion tasks.  The  objective of this research project is to develop a
              practical,  reliable planner for robotic contact tasks.  The planner will 
              operate in two stages.  In the first stage, parameter uncertainty  will be
              ignored to reduce the dimension of the space to be searched  for a manipulation
              plan.  The geometry of that space will be  determined and regions in which the
              multibody contact model admits  multiple solutions will be identified and
              avoided.  In the second  stage, the plan found in the first stage will be
              modified to make  it robust with respect to variations in the uncertain
              parameters.   The second stage will not involve a search, so its computational 
              complexity will be relatively low.  It will however involve  understanding the
              geometric variation in the space as a function of  the uncertain parameters. 
              To demonstrate the results of the  proposed research, a planner for planar
              manipulation systems will  be implemented in a distributed computing
              environment, with  parallel computers used where appropriate.  A prototype
              manipulator  system with position, torque, and tactile sensors will be designed
               and built to test generated plans.  ***
