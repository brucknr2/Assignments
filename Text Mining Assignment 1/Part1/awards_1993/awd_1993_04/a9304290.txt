Abstract    :
                   This award supports the research of Professor Gustafson to                
              work in combinatorics.  Professor Gustafson will work on a class               
              of orthogonal polynomials that were defined by Askey and Wilson.               
              These polynomials have applications as diverse as quantum physics              
              and additive number theory.  It is proposed to explicitly                      
              construct multivariate generalizations of the Askey-Wilson                     
              polynomials expressed in terms of a new generalization of                      
              hypergeometric functions of a matrix argument.                                 
                   The research is in the general area of combinatorics.                     
              Combinatorics attempts to find efficient methods to study how                  
              discrete collections can be organized.  The behavior of discrete               
              systems is extremely important to modern communications.  For                  
              example, the design of large networks, as in telephone systems,                
              and the design of algorithms in computer science all deal with                 
              discrete objects, and this makes use of combinatorial research.
