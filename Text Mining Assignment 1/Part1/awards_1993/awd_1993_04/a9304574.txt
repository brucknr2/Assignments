Abstract    :
              This is a Phase II project under the Small Business Research                   
              Innovation Program.  In the Phase I research, the H&N Instruments              
              Inc has obtained a proof of the concept of the Programmable Laser              
              Activated Parallel Synthesis (PROLAPS) and has established the                 
              feasibility of using PROLAPS to synthesize megapeptide arrays.                 
                                                                                             
              In this Phase II project, two major objectives are being pursued;              
              (1) optimize the instrumentation and procedures so that very                   
              large peptide arrays are synthesized, and (2) demonstrate the                  
              usefulness of peptide arrays as a screening method for finding                 
              peptides with desired molecular recognition properties.                        
                                                                                             
              If successful, this project will result in the complete                        
              automation of the prototype PROLAPS instrument.  This instrument               
              has a potential to become a useful tool to a broad areas of                    
              scientific research and development.
