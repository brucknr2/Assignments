Abstract    :
                   The metamorphosed stratified and  intrusive rocks of                      
              late Precambrian, Ordovician, Silurian and Devonian age in                     
              New England records an extremely complicated "Acadian"                         
              collisional history.  Recent results of radiometric age                        
              dating in the Bronson Hill anticlinorium and Merrimack                         
              synclinorium of central Massachusetts has revealed two                         
              distinct age groups of "Acadian" (early and late Devonian)                     
              metamorphism separated by a generally higher pressure zone                     
              of  late Pennsylvanian metamorphism.  This project will                        
              follow these features i the region to determine their                          
              spatial distribution and to obtain a more precise picture of                   
              the temporal evolution of the New England appalachians, and                    
              to improve understanding of its setting within the larger                      
              framework of the orogen.
