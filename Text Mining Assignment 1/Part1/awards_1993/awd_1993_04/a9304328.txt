Abstract    :
              9304328  Frances    The project examines the dynamic surface tension and 
              adsorption behavior of surfactants, lipids, and proteins at  the air/water
              interface.  Dynamic adsorption is important in  foam-based separations of toxic
              or useful chemicals from  dilute solutions.  It is also important in coasting
              flows,  pesticide spray efficiency, downstream bioprocessing of  hydrophobic
              molecules, and in lung surfactant formulations for  treating the respiratory
              distress syndrome of premature  infants.  The objectives are to study how
              different kinds of  molecular interactions of various surfactants and proteins 
              affect the competitive adsorption behavior.  Dynamic surface  tensions area
              measured either at constant area or at pulsating  area conditions.  Surface
              adsorption densities are estimated  from surface electrical potential
              measurements, from using  radiotracers, and from sampling the surface
              monolayers by the  use of Langmuir-Blodgett deposition method.  Moreover, an 
              apparatus is being built for probing dynamic concentration  profiles.  The
              results are correlated with transport-  adsorption description models and are
              used in interpreting  foam - concentration and foam fractionation experiments
              of  octanol, sodium dodecylsulfate, bovine serum albumin,  lysozyme, and other
              molecules.  Finally, hexadecanol,  dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, tyloxapol,
              and SP-A, SP-B, and  SP-C (lung specific proteins) are studied for their
              importance  in lung surfactant formulations.
