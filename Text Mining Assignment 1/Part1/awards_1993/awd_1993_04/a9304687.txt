Abstract    :
              Extensive genetic analyses of the maize anthocyanin pathway have               
              revealed multiple target genes, whose expression is coordinately               
              controlled by several regulatory genes. Our goal is to understand              
              the mechanisms by which the transcription of the genes encoding the            
              anthocyanin biosynthetic enzymes is coordinately controlled by                 
              three regulatory genes, b, c1, and a3. The proposed in vivo and in             
              vitro experiments should enable us to begin to distinguish between             
              possible models for how the regulatory proteins are interacting to             
              control transcription. Our specific aims are to : 1) mutationally              
              dissect the regions of C1 and B required for their interaction, 2)             
              identify other proteins involved, 3) develop in vitro assays for               
              analyzing B and C1 protein/protein interactions, 4) assess whether             
              the B and C1 proteins interact directly with structural gene                   
              regulatory sites, 5) identify the cis-acting sites required for B              
              and C1 regulation of uncharacterized structural gene promoters, 6)             
              identify functionally important regions of B using available                   
              transposable element insertions, 7) determine if a3 is acting at               
              the transcriptional level and if so, clone and characterize a3.

              Principles of gene regulation learned from these studies should                
              apply to other systems where a combined genetic and molecular                  
              approach is not yet feasible.
