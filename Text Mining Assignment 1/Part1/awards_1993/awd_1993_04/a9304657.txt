Abstract    :
              9304657  Owens                                   This research is to conduct a
              study of the crustal and upper  mantle structure in Tanzania by means of
              passive-source seismic  recording with the PASSCAL array and by means of
              analysis of  gravity data.  The existence of thick, depleted mantle lithosphere
               beneath ancient continental regions forms the basis of the model  for deep
              continental structure.  A principal assertion of this  model is that  cratonic
              nuclei with their lithospheric keels are  true islands of tectonic stability
              within a generally mobile and  less stable lithosphere.  This work will test
              this model of deep  continental structure by examining the stability of
              cratonic  lithosphere in an area of active tectonism, East Africa.  The 
              cratonic lithosphere in East Africa (the Tanzania Craton) has been  subjected
              to Cenozoic extensional tectonism,  providing a unique  opportunity to
              determine if deep cratonic structure can "survive"  an extensional event which
              has thermally and mechanically disrupted  adjacent younger lithosphere. 
              Similar structures in the U.S. are  the sites of current seismic activity and
              these results will bear  on the mechanism of the earthquake generating
              structure.  This  research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard
              Reduction  Program.  ***
