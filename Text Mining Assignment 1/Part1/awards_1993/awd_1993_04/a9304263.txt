Abstract    :
              9304263  Miller      The PI will conduct a series of shock wave experiments to
              expand the range of compositions of  upper mantle assemblages studied and to
              obtain partial molar volumes at high pressure.  These  experiments will permit
              a determination of the effects of olivine fractionation in many mantle- 
              derived magmas.  Experiments will also be performed to determine the Gruneisen
              parameter for  liquid silicates, addressing problems such as the thermal
              profile of a magma ocean, and modeling  of melting by adiabatic decompression
              of hot mantle diapirs.  ****                                          Program
