Abstract    :
                   Treil and Peller will continue their work on Hankel                       
              operators and their applications.  In particular, they will                    
              investigate spectral properties of self-adjoint Hankel operators               
              and their relations with balanced realizations with continuous                 
              time and with discrete time; spectral characterizations of the                 
              completely regular vectorial stationary random processes;                      
              superoptimal approximations of matrix-valued functions; and                    
              special approximation by finite rank Hankel operators that repeat              
              first singular values of the initial operator.                                 
                   Operator theory is that part of mathematics that studies the              
              infinite dimensional generalizations of matrices.  In particular,              
              when restricted to finite dimensional subspaces, an operator has               
              the usual linear properties, and thus can be represented by a                  
              matrix.  The central problem in operator theory is to classify                 
              operators satisfying additional conditions given in terms of                   
              associated operators (e.g. the adjoint) or in terms of the                     
              underlying space.  Operator theory underlies much of mathematics,              
              and many of the applications of mathematics to other sciences.
