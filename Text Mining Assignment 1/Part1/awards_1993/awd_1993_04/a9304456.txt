Abstract    :
              9304456  Lees       This award provides one-half the funds needed to acquire 
              computer hardware and software to be installed in the Department  of Geology
              and Geophysics at Yale University. Yale is committed to  providing the
              remaining funds needed for the acquisition.       The equipment will contribute
              to a geographical information   system that will be used by Department faculty
              and students for  acquiring, manipulating, and portraying a wide range of
              map-based  geologic and geophysical data.  ***
