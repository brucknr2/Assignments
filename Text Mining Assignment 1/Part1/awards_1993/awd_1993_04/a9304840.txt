Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a proposal to characterize the hydrology, hydrogeology, and            
              geochemistry of the northern Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico.  Northern              
              Yucatan is an emergent platform in which karst features are                    
              developing in rocks whose mineralogy is strongly dominated by                  
              limestone and dolomite.  Low content of argillaceous minerals and              
              high permeability insure a rapid throughput of groundwater in the              
              system.  Mixing of fresh and salt water result in a significant                
              zone of dispersion between the fresh groundwater lens and the                  
              underlying saline intrusion; and this zone of dispersion can                   
              significantly affect carbonate diagenesis.  Simple stratigraphy and            
              mineralogical composition, accessibility, and lack of human                    
              development make the northern Yucatan Peninsula an excellent                   
              natural laboratory.  The study area will be divided into four                  
              distinct zones characterized by strong differences in permeability.            
              Proposed research involves drilling holes (in collaboration with               
              Mexican ion content, environmental isotopes, saturation indices,               
              and Sr content), and making and calibrating electrical resistivity             
              surveys.  Interface behavior and its relation to diagenesis and                
              corrosion will be studied.  Data will be mapped or contoured and               
              used in numerical simulation of groundwater flow.
