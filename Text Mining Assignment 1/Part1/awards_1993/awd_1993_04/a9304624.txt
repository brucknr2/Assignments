Abstract    :
              9304624  Cohen         The PI's will investigate the physics of the core's most 
              abundant constituent, iron, at high pressures and temperatures,  including its
              sub-solidus phase relations, the thermo-elasticity of  its solid and liquid
              phases, dynamic properties of the melt and the  iron melting curve.  The
              properties of face-centered cubic,  hexagonal close packed and body centered
              cubic crystalline  structures are investigated with first principles solutions
              of  Schrodinger's Equation based on density functional theory.  They  will
              construct parametric model Hamiltonians to represent the  theoretical results
              and use this model in molecular dynamics  simulations of the equation of state,
              structure and viscosity of  liquid iron.  The model Hamiltonian will also be
              used in high  pressure cluster simulations of iron melting.  The aim of the 
              project is to predict and provide a firm theoretical basis for a  discussion of
              the temperature distribution in the core, the  composition of the solid inner
              core and liquid outer core and the  crystal structure of the inner core.  ***
