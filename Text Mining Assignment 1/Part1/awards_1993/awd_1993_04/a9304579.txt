Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The concept of tradeoff between current and future reproduction                
              ("cost of reproduction") is central to life history theory, and so             
              to our understanding of the evolution of reproductive                          
              characteristics.  For birds, existing empirical demonstrations of              
              this tradeoff are all flawed by poor choice of experimental                    
              species, short-term experiments, and drastic manipulations.  Hence             
              a fundamental tenet of evolutionary theory remains to be tested                
              rigorously in this group.  This proposal describes an experimental             
              test of the hypothesis that the cost of reproduction is a                      
              significant selective agent in the evolution of reproductive rate.             
              Specifically, the study can test the hypothesis that adding only               
              one additional offspring to a brood imposes a cost of reproduction             
              large enough to impose natural selection against that experimental             
              brood size.  By using an appropriate study species yielding large              
              samples and adopting a long-term perspective this study avoids the             
              flaws of previous work in this area.  This study builds on 10                  
              years of field work by the principal investigator with the study               
              species on related problems.

              Research of this type, in addition to being of fundamental                     
              importance to theoretical and empirical population biology, should             
              have positive bearing upon such emergent modern themes as species              
              conservation and biological diversity.  As well it may yield                   
              information useful in the commercial breeding of fowl for food.
