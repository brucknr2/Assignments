Abstract    :
              Paleozoic and Mesozoic silicic alkaline plutonism is                           
              developed on a batholith scale in Transbaikalia, Russia,                       
              within belts 1000's of kilometers long and spanning a time                     
              period of hundreds of millions of years.  The petrogenesis                     
              of these rocks will be investigated through a multi-                           
              disciplinary research project involving field, isotopic and                    
              petrological studies.  By combining detailed studies of                        
              individual plutonic complexes spanning a wide range of age                     
              with regional studies along the length of the magmatic                         
              belts, the chemical and isotopic variations of the alkaline                    
              granitoid magmas in time and space will be delineated.                         
              Integration of detailed outcrop-scale studies with regional                    
              geochemical systematic and field relationships will help to                    
              explain why this region produces such prodigious volumes of                    
              silicic alkaline magma during the Paleozoic and Mesozoic,                      
              and may lead to considerable advances in our understanding                     
              of continental anorogenic magmatism.
