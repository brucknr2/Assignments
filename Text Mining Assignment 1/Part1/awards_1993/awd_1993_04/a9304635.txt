Abstract    :
                   The emplacement of large, far-traveled Nappe complexes                    
              or thrust stacks are common features of A-type collisions.                     
              Recently, extensional processes have been shown to be                          
              active, at least during parts of the collision process.                        
              This project will examine the deeply eroded roots of the                       
              Scandinavian Caledonides to study the relations between a                      
              far traveled nappe complex and continental plate subducted                     
              beneath.  Mapping and laboratory work on the kinematics                        
              within this zone, the geological relations between the                         
              allocthon and underthrust Baltic Shield and the PTt                            
              evolution of the underthrust Baltic shield are the main                        
              focus of this project.  Results are expected to determine                      
              the involvement of the Baltic basement below a thin zone of                    
              basement thrusting and to test the extent of extensional                       
              displacement of the allocthon.
