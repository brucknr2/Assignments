Abstract    :
                   This award provides funds for the purchase of equipment that              
              will be used to interface two new germanium detectors (obtained by             
              Auburn University) to a gamma ray counting system at the Leach                 
              Nuclear Science Center at Auburn University. The gamma ray counting            
              system at Auburn is used primarily for neutron activation analysis             
              of geological samples, and the new detectors and counting system               
              will make it possible for the lab to detect and analyze for                    
              activated elements with low energy photopeaks.
