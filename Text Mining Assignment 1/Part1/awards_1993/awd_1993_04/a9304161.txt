Abstract    :
              A collaborative and cross-disciplinary research program at                     
              the University of Michigan and California Institute of                         
              Technology will be carried out to investigate the physics                      
              and chemistry of the fast processes and flows which occur in                   
              the conduits and near the vents of erupting volcanoes.                         
              Experimental simulations of volcanic eruptions will be                         
              carried out at small scale with systems which duplicate the                    
              velocities and accelerations generated during eruption by                      
              bubble growth and magma fragmentation.  The apparatus                          
              consists of a test cell which exhausts into a tank which can                   
              be evacuated.  Preliminary results show that the simple                        
              system CO2-H2O exhibits a variety of eruptive styles,                          
              ranging from explosive eruption, to violent bubbling and                       
              degassing (but no eruption), to quiet exsolution with                          
              occasional bubbling.  This work will be continued in three                     
              directions:  (1) experimental simulation under a variety of                    
              controlled conditions, varying such parameters as viscosity,                   
              surface tension, diffusion coefficient of CO2, chamber                         
              shape, pressure, etc., (2)  theoretical study of scaling                       
              laws for extrapolating experimental laboratory results to                      
              natural magmatic systems; and (3) development of methods for                   
              observing and quantifying the mechanism of fragmentation.
