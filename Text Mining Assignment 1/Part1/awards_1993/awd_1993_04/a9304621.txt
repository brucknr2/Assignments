Abstract    :
              9304621  McNutt      The PI will analyze gravity, elevation, and seismic
              velocity data in the wavelength band 6000-  3000 km to constrain the pattern of
              variations in viscosity  , and   /  , the factor that relates  seismic velocity
              to density.  By correlating the variations in   and   /   with the tectonic and
               volcanic history of the overlying plates, she will learn more about the
              effects of temperature,  mineralogy, stress, and partial melt on the dynamic
              behavior of the upper mantle.  ****
