Abstract    :
              This project involves the analysis of helium and oxygen                        
              isotope, and strontium-neodymium-lead isotopes in samples of                   
              young lavas from the Rungwe, South Kivu, Virunga and Toro-                     
              Ankole volcanic provinces of the East African Rift.  A                         
              diverse suite of rock types will be analyzed.  These samples                   
              are petrologically well characterized, well located, many                      
              have been dated by K-Ar, and some are now being studied for                    
              Os isotopes.  Isotopic variability will be investigated at                     
              three different scales; along the rift, within volcanic                        
              fields, and within individual volcanoes.  The coherent data                    
              set will provide constraints on the petrogenesis of these                      
              various rock types in a young continental rift, the nature                     
              of the associated fluid and melt transport from the mantle                     
              to the crust, and a better understanding of mantle and                         
              lithospheric sources in the magmatic development of the East                   
              African Rift system.
