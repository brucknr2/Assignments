Abstract    :
              9304217  Jacob       This is a 3 year program of modeling and data analysis to 
              study the exports of ozone, reactive nitrogen oxides, non-methane 
              hydrocarbons, and carbon monoxide form the northern mid-latitudes  continents
              to the global atmosphere, and to assess the resulting  anthropogenic
              perturbation to global tropospheric ozone.  The work  will involve full-year
              simulations using a 3 dimensional chemical  tracer model (CTM).  The first
              stage of the project will focus on  North America and outflow regions. 
              Specific issues to be addressed  in that stage include (1) the fate of
              anthropogenic reactive  nitrogen oxides emitted in the U.S., (2) the yield of
              ozone per  unit reactive nitrogen oxides emitted, (3) the exports of ozone and 
              its precursors form North America to the global atmosphere, and  (4)_ the
              usefulness of peroxides as tracers of photochemical  activity.  The second
              stage of the project will involve expansion  of the CTM to the scale of the
              extratropical northern hemisphere.   Specific issues to be addressed in that
              stage include:  (1) the  exports of ozone and its precursors from Europe and
              Asia, (2) the  yield of ozone per unit reactive nitrogen oxides in the remote 
              atmosphere, (3) the effect of human activity on ozone levels in the 
              extratropical northern hemisphere, and (4) the cross-tropopause  transport of
              ozone.
