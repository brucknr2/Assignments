Abstract    :
              This research will complete the development of an experimental                 
              method for measuring in situ cosmogenic 14C (half-life=5730 yrs) in            
              common surficial terrestrial materials, and for making pilot                   
              studies of the method for investigating a few challenging                      
              geomorphic problems.  From the work carried out to date under NSF              
              grant, we have in hand an experimental method, potentially capable             
              of providing accurate and contamination-free (from environmental               
              14C) measurements of 14C concentrations.  Instead of the commonly              
              adopted method of high temperature fusion, we developed a wet in               
              vacuo method to determine the in situ 14C concentrations in the CO             
              and CO2 phases in the mineral quartz.  Environmental 14C does not              
              affect the 14CO measurements, but appears erratically as                       
              contamination in the 14CO2 measurement.  Since more than 60% of in             
              situ 14C appears in the CO phase, it is convenient to assay in situ            
              14C by measuring its activity in the CO phase.  During the first               
              year, work will primarily be directed towards the development of a             
              robust experimental technique to accurately measure in situ 14C                
              concentration at levels of  >x104 atoms 14C/g quartz, and the                  
              determination of in situ 14C production rates in quartz at different           
              altitudes and latitudes.  The latter is a prerequisite for its                 
              applications.  In the second year, we propose to make some test                
              applications of the in situ 14C method to a number of selected                 
              geomorphic problems. It may appear that little can be done in such             
              challenging problems in just one year but we are able to do this               
              because we have at a suite of diverse geomorphic samples in which              
              in situ cosmogenic 10Be and 26Al studies have made earlier in our              
              group.  We believe that among the various in situ radionuclides, 14C           
              should offer the most convenient approach for characterizing                   
              geomorphic surfaces, providing a firm basis for decisions for                  
              further analyses using other in situ radionuclides, e.g. 36Cl, 26Al            
              and 10Be, and the stable nuclide, 21Ne.  We are very anxious to                
              complete the development of the experimental method to reliably                
              measure in situ cosmogenic 14C in surficial samples, and to                    
              demonstrate its usefulness in geomorphology.  //
