Abstract    :
              9304304    Dyar              This is a research program on experimental study of
              the   mechanical behavior of upper mantle rocks.  From an understanding   of
              the way in which hydrous species partition at upper mantle   conditions it will
              be possible to interpret mechanical property   measurements.  The proposed
              program will include static experiments   on aggregates of mantle minerals
              under high pressure and   temperature conditions, infrared measurements to
              characterize the   partitioning of water-derived species between the phases,
              and   Mossbauer spectroscopy measurements to monitor changes in the iron  
              valence during uptake of water.    ***
