Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The proposal seeks to carry out basic studies to determine the                 
              siting of U, Be, Sr and other cations in recent and old corals.  A             
              specific aim of the work is to determine whether these elements                
              exist partly or primarily as adsorbed onto organic matter, or are              
              exclusively sited within the lattice.  This knowledge is an                    
              essential prerequisite for using corals as paleorecorders of wide-             
              ranging geophysical and geochemical information, e.g., oceanic                 
              234U/238U and 10Be/9Be ratios, seawater metal concentrations and               
              atmospheric 14C/12C ratios.  Our studies will attempt to assess                
              whether coral compositions can be used for examining variability in            
              the geophysical parameter(s) of interest, and should help determine            
              the reliability of coral 14C/12C ratios, and also suggest suitable             
              methods to extract such information in a reliable manner, free of              
              effects due to diagenesis.  For example, if our studies show that              
              certain cations in corals are primarily adsorbed on organic matter,            
              the concentrations of those cations would be subject to exchange               
              with the environment.  To use such elements for paleoenvironment               
              studies, it would be necessary to extract cations from the                     
              aragonite lattice only.  We also propose to examine the suitability            
              of corals for determining surface oceanic 10Be/9Be ratios in the               
              past.  10Be is produced by cosmic ray nuclear interactions in the              
              atmosphere.  The 10Be half-life of 1.5 my promises to allow dating             
              corals of several millions of years' age from analyses of samples              
              of <50 gm weight.  The proposal is clearly exploratory in                      
              character, aiming at enhancing the potential of corals as recorders            
              of global paleoclimatic and paleo-oceanographic parameters.
