Abstract    :
              9304672  Maxwell  Eukaryotic small nuclear RNAs(snRNAs) play critical roles in
              the  processing of both pre-messenger and pre-ribosomal RNAs. One such 
              nucleolar snRNA designated U14 snRNA is essential for the  processing of
              pre-ribosomal RNA. The evolutionarily conserved  ability of fungal, amphibian
              and mammalian U14 snRNAs to  intermolecularly base-pair with 18SrRNA suggests
              that this  hydrogen-bonding interaction is important in U14 snRNA function and 
              ribosomal RNA processing events. We have demonstrated that the  mouse U14 snRNA
              genes are located within introns 5,6 and 8 of the  constitutively-expressed
              cognate hsc70 heat shock gene, a  positioning which led to experiments
              confirming that an intron-  processing pathway for U14 snRNA production exists.
              This is the  first example of a eukaryotic pre-mRNA intron which is processed
              to  yield a stable, biologically functional RNA species. We will  continue
              characterizing U14 snRNA synthesis, structure and function  while exploring the
              evolutionary conservation of those parameters.   The processing
              sequences/structures essential for U14 snRNA  excision will be determined by
              several different approaches. We  will examine the developmental expression of
              U14 snRNA/hsc70 pre-  mRNA in Xenopus laevis. We will examine the genomic
              organization of  U14 snRNA genes in evolutionarily diverse eukaryotic
              organisms.  %%%  RNA is utilized both as a structural molecule for protein
              synthesis  as well as a messenger molecule in the same process. Smaller RNA 
              species have been found to be essential to the correct synthesis of  the
              ribosomal and messenger RNAs and a number of them have been  isolated and
              characterized. U14 snRNA is one such molecule, but one  which is unique in that
              it was found by this laboratory to be  located in introns of another gene, the
              hsc70 heat shock gene. This  is the first example of an intron which is
              processed to yield a  stable, biologically functional RNA species. The process
              of  producing the U14 snRNA will be studied more extensiv ely as well as  the
              developmental expression and the evolutionary conservation of  this RNA
              species.  ***
