Abstract    :
              9304554  Reilinger      The PIs will continue and expand their research effort
              to use GPS to monitor relative plate motions and intra-plate deformations
              throughout the Eurasian-African-Arabian plate collision zone.  Over the past 5
              years this group has completed six GPS campaigns in Turkey and have established
              first epoch measurements in Caucasia.  Based on this work, they will establish
              a coherent GPS network extending further west-east from the Aegean Sea to the
              Caspian Sea, and north-south from the Eurasian platform in southwest
              Russia/Ukraine to the Arabian plate in southern Turkey.  They will undertake
              large-scale surveys in the entire region in alternate years (94, 96, 98).  The
              resulting new information on crustal motions and deformations will be combined
              with other relevant geophysical and geological data to constrain realistic
              models of the plate interactions with the ultimate objective of enhancing our
              understanding of Earth dynamics.  ****
