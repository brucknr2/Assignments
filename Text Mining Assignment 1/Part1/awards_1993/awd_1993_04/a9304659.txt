Abstract    :
              9304659  Pratt       PIs will develop a high-resolution stratigraphic and 
              geochemical framework for the Lower and middle Cretaceous in  northern South
              America, with focus on the Cenomanian-Turonian  boundary interval.  These data
              are needed to establish a regional  picture of sea level change, primary marine
              production, and  biologic evolution in the Caribbean gateway between the
              Pacific and  the developing Atlantic oceans.  Isotopic and geochemical data
              will  be used to calculate the total quantity of marine organic carbon 
              preserved on this margin, making it possible to assess the degree  to which the
              equatorial region influenced global concentrations of  carbon dioxide and
              oxygen in the Cretaceous atmosphere.
