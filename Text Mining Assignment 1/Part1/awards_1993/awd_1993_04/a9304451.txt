Abstract    :
              9303351  Spetzler         The recent development in the PI's laboratory of a GHz
               ultrasonic interferometer with moderate pressure and temperature  capabilities
              (600 MPa and 400K) opens new possibilities for elastic  parameter measurements.
               Because of the inherently high precision  of the technique and because of the
              high frequency, elastic  parameters and their pressure and temperature
              derivatives can be  determined for many new minerals and their high pressure
              phases for  which only small (sub millimeter) samples are available.  Measure- 
              ments will be made on the pyrope-almandine-grossular solid solution  series. 
              This garnet suite represents a very important mantle  constituent in the major
              mantle mineralogy models.  ***
