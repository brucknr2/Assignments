Abstract    :
                This research is to develop and implement inversion methods based            
              on neural networks for application to geophysical inversion                    
              problems, particularly, seismic inversion.  The motivation for this            
              approach is to improve the mapping of elastic parameters along a               
              seismic line.  This type of inversion for each point along a                   
              seismic line is currently computationally expensive.  However, for             
              a selected number of points along a line, it can be used to derive             
              the elastic properties while training a neural network, that is,               
              deriving the connection weights.  After training, seismic gathers              
              from the intermediate surface points can be input to the network               
              to estimate depth-dependent elastic properties for those points                
              resulting in a complete map.  The most difficult part of the                   
              problem is to train the network.  Global optimization methods such             
              as simulated annealing and genetic algorithms will be used for the             
              network training since the methods have proven successful in                   
              geophysical inversion.
