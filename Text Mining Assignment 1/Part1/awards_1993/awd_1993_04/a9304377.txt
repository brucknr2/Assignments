Abstract    :
                   The uplift and exhumation of high pressure rocks in                       
              orogenic zones is a long-standing problem.  A new hypothesis                   
              for the uplift and exhumation of blueschists and eclogites                     
              has been developed in this project on the basis of                             
              structural analysis of Late Cretaceous subduction complex in                   
              eastern Venezuela.  The observation that these rocks had                       
              undergone large extensional strains parallel to the arcuate                    
              trend of the subduction zone and the volcanic arc led to a                     
              model in which oblique plate convergence changes required                      
              large arc-parallel extension and considerable forearc                          
              thinning.  This renewal will test several aspects of this                      
              new model by dating the deformation sequence and determine                     
              the pressure-temperature history of particularly the lower                     
              grade rocks of the complex, and compare the results to the                     
              predictions of the model.  Results are expected to test this                   
              possible mechanism of returning high pressure rocks to the                     
              earth's surface.
