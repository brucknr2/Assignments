Abstract    :
              9304295  Lukas  This is a planning grant for research in concurrent software 
              systems. It addresses the specification phase with a formal  specification
              language family that utilizes the object as the  basic model. The long-term
              objective of the research is to define  a hierarchy of formal specification
              languages that address, in  increasing specificity, the requirements of
              concurrent systems.  This family of languages is based on the concept of a base
               language that serves as the parent class and subclasses that  represent
              increasingly specific features of concurrent systems.  The preliminary approach
              is to first develop a hierarchical  description of the classes and their
              relationships and then to  formally define the base class, both syntactically
              and  semantically. Using inheritance, subclasses will then be defined  for
              categories of programming languages that support specific  language features.
              This approach to the specification of  concurrent object-oriented systems
              promotes the use of  abstraction and assists the specifier with the
              transformation of  a problem to a language-specific form. The hierarchy of 
              specifications also has potential for specification reuse.    The  planing
              activities include comprehensive study of research  in  areas  that  are 
              fundamental  to  the  proposed  research,  including  formal  specification
              languages, concurrent  object  oriented  languages, and algebraic
              specifications. The planning  activities  also include the development of a
              mini-language  to  provide  a  mechanism for experimentation and for expansion 
              of  the proposed research.  ***
