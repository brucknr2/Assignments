Abstract    :
              9304159  Halliday       This award provides 45 percent of the funds required for
              the  development of a mass spectrometer system that will combine a laser 
              ablation sampling source with plasma ionization and a multi-  collector
              magnetic sector mass spectrometer. The system will be  developed to optimize
              analytical performance with respect to  microanalytical spatial resolution as
              well as trace element and  isotope sensitivity for a wide range of geological
              samples. It will  be housed and operated in the Department of Geological
              Sciences at  the University of Michigan. The University of Michigan is
              committed  to providing the remaining funds needed to carry out this 
              instrument development project.       The instrument will extend existing
              capabilities for trace  element and isotopic analysis and will be applied to
              research  including the dating of microscopic fluid inclusions by the 
              rubidium-strontium radioactive decay method, lutetium-hafnium  isotope
              geochemistry of small samples, transition element  geochemistry of terrestrial
              and extraterrestrial materials, and  precise geochronology to determine the
              production rates of silicic  magma.  ***
