Abstract    :
              9304492  Romanowicz    This research is to model global lateral heterogeneity in
              the  mantle from long-period body waveforms, using a more adequate  theory than
              employed until now in inversions of long-period body  waves.  The theory takes
              a normal mode approach which differs from  previous ones in that the
              cross-branch coupling is considered.  The  theory is accurate within the
              great-circle section defined by the  source and receiver and able to bring out
              the ray character of  long-period body waves.  Focusing and defocusing effects
              within the  great-circle section are automatically taken into account.  It uses
               an asymptotic approximation to treat the effect of lateral  heterogeneity in
              the direction perpendicular to the great circle,  as done implicitly in all the
              previous inversions of long-period  body waves.  A computationally practical
              inversion algorithm has  been set up and tested.  It will now be applied to the
              global long-  period digital data set starting with SH and then extending to P-
               SV cases.  ***
