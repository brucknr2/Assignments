Abstract    :
              9304520  Moskowitz         A major goal of this proposal is to study the
              influence of  crystal defects on magnetic behavior in magnetite and 
              titanomagnetite.  Crystal defects can act as centers for the  nucleation of new
              domain walls and aid changes in magnetization,  or they can pin existing domain
              walls and inhibit changes in  magnetization.  Aside from some rudimentary
              details, there is a  lack of quantitative knowledge about wall-defect
              interactions.   Specifically, defect structures will be changed and manipulated
              in  a controlled manner by bulk plastic deformation, by single grain 
              micro-indentation, and by thermal annealing experiments.  The main  purpose of
              these experiments will be to determine how coercivity  and remanence varies
              with the degree of deformation and with  recovery through annealing and to
              assess critically recent  theoretical micromagnetic models for the thermal
              dependence of  coercivity produced by specific types and arrangements of
              defects.  ***
