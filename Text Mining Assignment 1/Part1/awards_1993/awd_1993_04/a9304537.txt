Abstract    :
              9304537  Sercel      The formation of nanometer-scale III-V quantum dots by the 
              vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) growth mechanism will be investigated.  The basic goal
              of the research is to establish the feasibility of  the process.  Unlike
              previous approaches, the technique will  produce quantum dots by mask-free
              epitaxy on the surface of a  semiconductor substrate. Nanometer-scale group-III
              liquid metal  droplets deposited on semiconductor substrates will be 
              supersaturated with arsenic in a UHV deposition chamber, driving  VLS growth of
              III-V quantum dots. The metal droplets will be  placed on the growth substrate
              by two methods: (1) deposition of  nanometer-scale metal clusters, and (2)
              melting of arrays of  nanometer-scale metal dots formed by patterning thin
              metal films  using electron-beam lithography. The latter method in particular 
              will permit fabrication of regular arrays of GaAs and InAs  quantum dots for
              production of periodic optical gain media. The  absence of surface rnasking
              material will permit epitaxial growth  of a wider band-gap encapsulation layer,
              and therefore, ultimate  application of the technique to fabrication of devices
              such as  the quantum dot semiconductor lasers.  %%%  The ability to directly
              synthesize three-dimensional  semiconductor nanostructures, such as quantum
              dots, would enable  realization of a number of predicted benefits. Applications
              which  have been proposed for semiconductor quantum dot materials  include use
              as an optical gain medium in semiconductor lasers, as  a nonlinear medium for
              optical switching applications and in  novel synthetic doping schemes. If the
              approach is successful, it  will represent a new form of epitaxy with
              potentially great  impact on optoelectronics technology.  ***
