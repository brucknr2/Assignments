Abstract    :
              9304831   Fisher       PI will calibrate estimated density of later middle
              through  early late Cenomanian waters at a mid-Cretaceous ocean front in the 
              Western Interior Seaway to paleotemperature estimates from stable  oxygen
              isotope analyses measured on planktic foraminifera.  Test  porosity of planktic
              foraminifera, and possibly of calcareous  nannoplankton, will be used to
              estimate water density.  Specimens  will be compared from Montana, Wyoming, and
              different  paleolatitudes from DSDP/ODP sites.  This is a research planning 
              grant; planned future research would extend the methods toward the  proposed
              hypersaline "Supertethys" sea of this time period.  ***
