Abstract    :
              9304077  Howe       This quantitative transmission electron microscope (TEM) at 
              the University of Virginia (UVa) will contain a 200 kV field  emission gun
              (FEG), energy dispersive x-ray spectrometer (EDS) and  imaging filter (IF),
              with a slow-scan charge-coupled divide (CCD)  camera and parallel electron
              energy loss, (PEELS) capability.  This  instrument will enable quantitative
              imaging, diffraction and  compositional analyses to be performed on all types
              of materials  with high spatial and energy resolution.  It is essential for
              many  materials programs within the School of Engineering and Applied  Science
              (SEAS) at UVa.  UVa has faculty and staff with sufficient  expertise in TEM
              techniques to ensure that the quantitative TEM is  utilized for the highest
              quality materials research and that it is  maintained at an optimum level of
              performance.  ***
