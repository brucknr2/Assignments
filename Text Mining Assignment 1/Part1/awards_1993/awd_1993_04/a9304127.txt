Abstract    :
              The DelPhi program will be extended to problems related to membrane            
              protein systems.  These studies aim at clarifying the principles               
              that underlie the structure and function of membrane proteins.                 
              Membrane protein electrostatic properties will be characterized,               
              free energies of insertion of proteins into the membrane phase will            
              be calculated, and pH effects relevant to the function of membrane             
              proteins will be investigated.                                                 
              %%%                                                                            
              Theoretical and computational methods will be employed to                      
              characterize the structure of proteins which interact with                     
              biological membranes.  Initially protein structure will be reduced             
              to a simple electrostatic-geometric model which will be interacted             
              with a membrane bilayer.  Such studies will contribute important               
              insights into: the stability of proteins when embedded in                      
              biological membranes, the energy required to insert proteins into              
              membranes, and how protein behavior is controlled in membrane                  
              systems.  Since the membrane: protein system is largely responsible            
              for transferring information from the environment into the cell,               
              understanding the fundamentals of the structure of the                         
              protein: membrane system itself is of great importance.
