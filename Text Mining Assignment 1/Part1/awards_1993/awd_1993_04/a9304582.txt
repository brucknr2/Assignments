Abstract    :
              Ocean Island basalts analyzed to date include extreme                          
              examples of all known mantle isotopic associations.  Os                        
              isotope ratios, particularly at HIMU localities, range to                      
              very radiogenic values and are quite variable.  There are                      
              several possible explanations.  1) Heterogeneous mantle                        
              source materials are tapped selectively by differing magma                     
              generation mechanisms in such a way as to preclude                             
              radiogenic Os compositions in Os-rich magmas.  The full                        
              range of Os isotopic compositions must be attainable,                          
              however in Os-poor magmas.  2) Accumulation and possible                       
              resorption of  lithospheric cumulate olivine, resulting in                     
              Os-rich magmas, modulates the Os isotopic compositions of                      
              these magmas.  3) Assimilation of manganese-encrusted                          
              altered basaltic material, in the ocean crust or oceanic-                      
              island volcanic pile, is sufficient to elevate the                             
              187Os/186Os ratios of Os-poor magmas, but not Os-rich                          
              magmas.  Investigation of the relative importance of non-                      
              mantle mechanisms for the modification of Os isotope ratios                    
              in magmas is imperative.  To this end, we propose a series                     
              of experiments to be performed on the island of La Palma in                    
              the Canary Islands.
