Abstract    :
                   The PI will investigate several different, yet mutually                   
              connected problems in number theory.  One part will focus on the               
              asymptotic behavior of integral solutions to inhomogeneous Pell                
              inequalities.  Another part of this proposal deals with the study              
              of the global version to the part just described, namely, counting             
              the number of lattice points in tilted rectangles.                             
                   This is research in the field of number theory.   Number                  
              theory starts with the whole numbers and questions such as the                 
              divisibility of one whole number by another.  It is among the                  
              oldest fields of mathematics and it was originally pursued for                 
              purely aesthetic reasons.  However, within the last half century,              
              it has become an essential tool in developing new algorithms for               
              computer science and new error correcting codes for electronics.
