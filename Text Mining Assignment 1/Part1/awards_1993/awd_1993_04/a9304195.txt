Abstract    :
              9304195  Smith  The goals of this research are: 1) to use the hormone-induced 
              differentiation of 3T3-L1 fibroblasts into adipocytes to examine  the role of
              different phospholipid head-groups in receptor  structure and function 2) to
              use altered Phospholipid composition  to study regulation of phospholipid
              metabolism in animal cells and  3) to continue to develop the use of the
              ciliate protozoan  Tetrahymena thermophila as a model system for the study of 
              eukaryotic phospholipid metabolism and the role of different  phospholipids in
              membrane structure and function. The research will  involve undergraduates in
              laboratory experience useful for a  scientific career.  %%%  The goals of this
              research are to examine the effect of synthetic  analogs of membrane components
              on the function of receptor proteins  which exist embedded within the cell
              membrane, and to use these  compounds to study the phospholipid composition of
              cellular  membranes and its regulation in animal cells.  Also, the 
              investigator will continue to develop the use of the ciliated  protozoan as a
              model system for the study of eukaryotic  phospholipid metabolism and the role
              of different phospholipids in  membrane structure and function. The research
              will involve  undergraduates in laboratory experience useful for a scientific 
              career  ***
