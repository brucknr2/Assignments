Abstract    :
                   The changing character of economies not only affects the                  
              geographic distribution of economic activities, it also affects                
              the form and nature of participation by different groups of                    
              people in different types of activities.  In western Africa, the               
              production and marketing of produce grown in gardens                           
              traditionally was conducted by women, but changes in economic and              
              social structures during the 20th Century have altered the roles               
              of men and women in these processes.  This doctoral dissertation               
              research project will examine the social history of market                     
              gardening in the Bobo-Dioulasso region of southwestern Burkina                 
              Faso through three critical eras of change:  (1) the 1920s and                 
              1930s, when missionaries introduced European vegetables,                       
              cultivation techniques, and dietary habits; (2) the drought years              
              of the 1970s, when foreign donors funded agricultural                          
              diversification and irrigation projects; and (3) the current                   
              period of World Bank-mandated structural adjustment and austerity              
              programs.  Ethnographic data-collection techniques will be used                
              in three gardening villages and in central marketplaces of the                 
              study area in order to obtain information about land, labor, and               
              technology employed in commercial vegetable production.  These                 
              data will be complemented by information from gardeners and                    
              traders, village elders, and government and non-governmental                   
              officials.                                                                     
                   In addition to advancing empirical knowledge about changing               
              African food-production economies, this project will contribute                
              to theoretical understandings of the dynamic interaction among                 
              macroeconomic conditions, social ideologies, and local practices               
              and gender relations.  As a doctoral dissertation improvement                  
              award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising              
              student to establish a strong independent research career.
