Abstract    :
                   Professor Vojta will work in arithmetic geometry                          
              specifically finiteness statements for rational and integral                   
              points on varieties. In particular he wants to continue to                     
              explore insights into the analogies between diophantine                        
              approximations and Nevanlinna theory.                                          
                   This project falls into the general area of arithmetic                    
              geometry -a subject that blends two of the oldest areas of                     
              mathematics: number theory and geometry.  This combination has                 
              proved extraordinarily fruitful - having recently solved problems              
              that withstood generations.  Among its many consequences are new               
              error correcting codes.  Such codes are essential for both modern              
              computers (hard disks) and compact disks.
