Abstract    :
                   We plan to identify optimal and efficient statistical                     
              designs in several commonly used scientific studies. These areas               
              include, but not limite to, two-level factorial designs for main               
              effects and selected two-factor interactions; resolution III                   
              and more two-level fractional factorial designs with (weak)                    
              minimum aberration; repeated measurements designs for comparative              
              bioavaliability studies.                                                       
                   Inference based on data collected via poorly designed                     
              studies is generally misleading and could be invalid altogether.               
              Good science calls for good data and good data can come only                   
              through statistically designed studies. This proposal plans to                 
              identify and build statistically efficient designs/per unit cost               
              so that better data can be collected and valid scientific                      
              inference can be made. Our discoveries will have immediate                     
              applications to many areas of scientific  studies including                    
              medicine and engineering. We plan to solve design problems which               
              have been posed to us by scientists at US FDA, and many US                     
              industries.
