Abstract    :
              9304850  Hendrickx    Unstable wetting fronts are the least understood physical 
              phenomenon in soils.  They start out as horizontal wetting fronts  that under
              certain conditions break into "fingers" or "preferential  flow paths" as the
              front moves downward, much like rain running off  a sheet of glass breaking
              into streams.  These fingers facilitate  the transport of contaminants to the
              groundwater at velocities many  times those calculated if a stable horizontal
              front is assumed.   The investigators describe theoretical, experimental, and
              field  evidence that confirm the occurrence of unstable wetting fronts in 
              field soils. The research objectives are: (1) Verify the  hydrodynamic
              stability by applying Richard's flow equation for a  wide range of field soils
              with lysimeter and field experiments; (2)  Apply theory to derive   the
              relations between soil physical  characteristics, initial water content,
              infiltration flux, and the  occurrence of unstable wetting fronts; (3) expand
              the theory and  experiments  to include heterogeneous soils and boundary 
              conditions. The main experimental difficulty of this study is the  labor
              intensive nature of the lysimeter and field work.  The  researchers propose to
              fill large lysimeters (volume 1.2 m3,  diameter 1.0 m) with different soil
              types to study fingers with  large diameters that have not been studied before.
               They will take   about 500 volumetric water content  samples at each sites for
              a  precise description of the wetting patterns in field soils.  Better 
              understanding of the mechanism of unstable wetting fronts will lead  to better
              risk assessments for groundwater contamination, allow  construction of more
              effective landfills and storage ponds, and  help in the design of more
              efficient groundwater recharge systems.   ***
