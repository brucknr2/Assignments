Abstract    :
                   This award provides 50% of the funds required for the purchase            
              of a differential scanning calorimeter and a dilatometer/viscometer            
              that will be housed and operated in the Department of Geological               
              Sciences at the University of Michigan. The University of Michigan             
              is committed to providing the remaining funds necessary for this               
              equipment acquisition.                                                         
                   The equipment is to be used for the measurement of heat                   
              capacity and other thermodynamic and transport properties of                   
              silicate minerals and liquids of interest in research on the                   
              chemical and physical processes taking place in the Earth's crust              
              and mantle.
