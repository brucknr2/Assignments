Abstract    :
                   Howland will investigate stability and chaos in quantum                   
              systems with Hamiltonians almost periodic in time; existence of                
              scarred wave functions and resonant states corresponding to                    
              unstable periodic orbits of the classical system; perturbation                 
              theory of the multiphoton a.c. Stark effect; and existence of                  
              absolutely continuous spectra in random Schroedinger operators                 
              and other systems.                                                             
                   Modern physics, quantum mechanics and relativity, is a                    
              product of the twentieth century.  It is founded firmly in the                 
              last century's attempt to address the microstructure of matter                 
              and to come to grips with the concepts of action-at-a distance,                
              electro-magnetism, and heat radiation.  The mathematical                       
              foundations for these developments, collectively called                        
              mathematical physics, ranges from detailed analysis of                         
              Schroedinger operators, which governs the dynamics of particles,               
              to unified field theory, which attempts to unite the four known                
              forces into a single theory.
