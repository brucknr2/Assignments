Abstract    :
              9304859  Grand                            This research is a continuation of a
              collaborative effort of four  universities to use the PASSCAL portable
              broad-band seismometer  array facility for a comprehensive imaging study of the
              lateral  transitions in mantle structure beneath the Rocky Mountain Front.  
              Field work was completed under the first grant and this will  complete the
              analysis and synthesis of the data.  The Front Range  of the Colorado Rockies
              marks the eastern boundary of heavily  tectonized western North America and the
              western physiographic  boundary of the stable continental interior.  Earlier
              studies show  that there is a major lateral transition in seismic velocities 
              across the Front Range transition, but its details are poorly  understood. 
              Understanding this transition will provide constraints  on models of western
              U.S. dynamics and evolutionary models of the  North American craton.    ***
