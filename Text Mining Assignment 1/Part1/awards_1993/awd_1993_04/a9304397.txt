Abstract    :
                   The Department of Engineering Sciences and Applied                        
              Mathematics of Northwestern University will purchase workstations              
              which will be dedicated to support research in the mathematical                
              sciences.  The equipment will be used for several research                     
              projects concerning the dynamics of nonlinear partial                          
              differential equations and applications, including in particular:              
                   .  Advection by a dipolar vortex couple in the                            
                      presence of small diffusion.                                           
                   .  The numerical computation of pulse propagation in                      
                      nonlinear optical fibers.                                              
                   .  The influence of noise and quenched disorder on                        
                      the growth of spatial structures.
