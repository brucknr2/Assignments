Abstract    :
                This research is to develop and test a new technique for using               
              precariously balanced rocks to provide constraints on probabilities            
              for strong ground motion due to earthquakes.  Examples of                      
              precariously balanced rocks found in California and Nevada will be             
              studied in detail with both physical models and numerical models.              
              Based on the results, an evaluation will be made for wider                     
              application.  This research is a component of the National                     
              Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
