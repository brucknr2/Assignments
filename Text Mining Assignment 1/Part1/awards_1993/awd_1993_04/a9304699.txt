Abstract    :
              This project is a continuation of a series of studies that                     
              focuses on the phase equilibria and thermodynamics of                          
              important mineral systems.  The current project emphasizes                     
              studies on biotite, ferrosilite, esseneite, Fe-Ti oxides,                      
              ternary feldspars, and Ca-Mg-Fe carbonates using reversed                      
              phase equilibrium experiments followed by thermodynamic                        
              solution modelling of the results.  This research will                         
              ultimately have application in constraining the intensive                      
              parameters (e.g., temperature and  pressure) under which                       
              igneous and metamorphic rocks crystallized.
