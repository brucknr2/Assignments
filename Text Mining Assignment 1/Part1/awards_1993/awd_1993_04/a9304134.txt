Abstract    :
              This proposal focuses on the enzymatic synthesis of methyl                     
              chloride.  Methyl chloride transferase, an enzyme which has been               
              recently discovered in Dr. Hager's laboratory, catalyzes the                   
              synthesis of methyl chloride from S-adenosylmethionine and chloride            
              ion.  Methyl chloride is the most abundant halohydrocarbon in the              
              upper atmosphere and thus becomes a potential candidate for                    
              destruction of the ozone layer.  The annual global emission rate of            
              methyl chloride from biological sources is estimated to be 5x106               
              tons.  However, there is scientific disagreement concerning the                
              role of naturally occurring halometabolites and man-made chloro-               
              fluoro hydrocarbons (CFCs) in terms of ozone destruction.                      
              %%%                                                                            
              Methyl chloride transferase in marine algae and halophytic plants              
              may be a mechanism for the injection of massive amounts of methyl              
              chloride into the atmosphere.  For example, ice plant grows                    
              abundantly on a world-wide basis in temperate coastal regions, thus            
              can be a major contributor to atmospheric methyl chloride.  The                
              enzyme may also play a role in salt tolerance of plants.                       
              Transformation of soy bean with the gene for the enzyme may lead to            
              the development of salt tolerant plants.
