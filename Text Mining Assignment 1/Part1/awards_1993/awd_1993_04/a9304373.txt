Abstract    :
              Professor Paul Barbara is supported by a grant from the                        
              Throretical and Computational Chemistry Program to conduct                     
              experimental studies of ultrafast chemical dynamics in polar                   
              solvents.  Four specific areas of research are planned: 1) an                  
              investigation of the vibrational relaxation in small radical                   
              anions in polar solvents; 2) the evolution of reactant                         
              electronic structure during a chemical reaction; 3) the                        
              dynamical coupling of proton and solvent motion in reacting                    
              systems; and 4) the role of quantum solvent nuclear degrees of                 
              freedom in charge-transfer reactions.                                          
              %%%                                                                            
              Since many commercially important chemical reactions take place                
              in polar solvents such as water, it is important to understand                 
              the influence which such solvents have on the reaction                         
              dynamics.  A number of effects, such as solvent cage effects,                  
              vibrational relaxation and quantum mechanical tunneling, which                 
              are not present in the gas phase completely dominate condensed                 
              phase chemical reactions.  It is important to develop reliable                 
              theories for model chemical systems which can then be applied                  
              to improving the efficiency of commercially important chemical                 
              reactions.  The work which is being performed by Barbara                       
              provides an important experimental basis for the development of                
              such theories.
