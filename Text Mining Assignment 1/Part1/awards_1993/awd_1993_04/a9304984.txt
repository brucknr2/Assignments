Abstract    :
              9304984  Kieffer       Multiresolution techniques for image compression shall be
               investigated as well as the problem of finding algorithms for  compressing
              text that outperform text compression algorithms which  are based upon
              finite-state automata. Efficiency questions  concerning universal codes shall
              be addressed, as well as the use  of universal codes in model class
              identification and statistical  parameter estimation. In computational
              information theory fast  algorithms shall be sought for finding successive
              approximations to  entropy rates, channel capacities, and rate distortion
              functions;  also, cellular automata and other automata shall be sought for  the
              fast performance of encoding and decoding tasks.  ***
