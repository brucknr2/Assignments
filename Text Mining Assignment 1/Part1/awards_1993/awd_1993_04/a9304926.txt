Abstract    :
              Goff  9304926  The focus of this project is the detailed characterization of 
              bovine lactoperoxidase active site structural and reactivity  properties.  The
              enzyme utilizes hydrogen peroxide and  thiocyanate ion to generate an oxidized
              bacteriostatic product.   Hence, further characterization of oxidized
              thiocyanate  intermediates will be of importance to a general understanding of 
              peroxidase antimicrobial action.  Specific objectives of this  project include:
              (1) definitive assignment of the unusual heme  structure of lactoperoxidase;
              (2) determination of active site  structural modifications associated with
              peroxidase metabolism of  thiocarbamide derivatives; (3) full description of 
              lactoperoxidase compound I (doubly oxidized) electronic  structure; and (4)
              identification of a newly discovered  lactoperoxidase-mediated SCN- oxidation
              product.  %%%  Mammalian heme peroxidase enzymes provide the major non- 
              immunologic protective response to invading microbes.  Leukocyte  and exocrine
              fluid peroxidases utilize hydrogen peroxide and  halide or pseudohalide ions
              for oxidative defense against  bacteria, parasites, and viruses.  The studies
              proposed will  characterize the mechanism by which these peroxidases generate 
              this oxidized bacteriostatic product and to some extent  characterize this  
              product.  ***
