Abstract    :
                   This award supports the research of Professor A. Zelevinsky to            
              work in combinatorics.  He intends to investigate problems arising             
              from the study of Aomoto-Gelfand hypergeometric functions and their            
              generalizations. Applications to classical elimination theory, real            
              algebraic geometry, Chow varieties, Grobner bases and matroids will            
              also be considered.                                                            
                   The research is in the general area of combinatorics.                     
              Combinatorics attempts to find efficient methods to study how                  
              discrete collections of objects can be organized.  And, so it is               
              extremely important to modern communications, for example the                  
              design of large networks as in telephone systems and the design of             
              algorithms in computer science.
