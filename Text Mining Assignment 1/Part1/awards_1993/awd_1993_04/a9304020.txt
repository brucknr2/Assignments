Abstract    :
              The goal of this research is to design micromachined                           
              patterned surfaces for orthopaedic implant devices that                        
              selectively cause the following types of reactions:  1)                        
              promote bone and restrict soft tissue ingrowth in critical                     
              regions; 2) enhance soft tissue growth while inhibiting bone                   
              growth; and 3) act as a barrier for soft tissue ingrowth                       
              into bone attachment areas.  Combinations of the                               
              microgeometries will be tested for their ability to                            
              encourage and/or discourage site-specific tissue ingrowth                      
              and thus achieve a longer-lived hip arthroplasty device.                       
                                                                                             
              The enhanced design of bone attachment surfaces for joint                      
              implant devices will provide an improved marketable product.                   
              The field of orthopaedic joint implants is projected to grow                   
              at 20% per year over the next 10 years with currently over                     
              400,000 total hip arthroplasties performed annually.
