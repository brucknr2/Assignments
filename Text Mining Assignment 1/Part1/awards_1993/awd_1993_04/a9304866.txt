Abstract    :
                   Chromosomes of eukaryotes have regions of differing                       
              compaction termed heterochromatin and euchromatin. Heterochromatin             
              has a high density of repetitious DNA, few genes and little                    
              transcription. Active genes, most of which are found in the                    
              euchromatin, are inactivated if they are removed to heterochromatic            
              regions. This effect, called position effect variegation (PEV), has            
              been extensively studied in Drosophila melanogaster, the fruit fly.            
              There is evidence that the telomeric regions at the ends of                    
              eukaryotic chromosomes are specialized heterochromatic-like                    
              domains. The project proposed uses telomeric PEV in Drosophila to              
              investigate telomeric chromatin by identification of telomeric non-            
              histone proteins and telomeric DNA sequences which bind those                  
              proteins. A white eye color gene flanked by telomeric sequences                
              will be integrated at non-telomeric locations and the expression of            
              that gene with and without the telomeric sequences will be                     
              compared. A second approach will be to localize the DNA sequences              
              necessary and/or sufficient to bind HP1, a protein characterized in            
              other laboratories, which is implicated in chromatin condensation.             
              %%%                                                                            
              The primary objective of this project is to identify telomeric                 
              proteins and the DNA sequences to which they bind, but the                     
              resulting data will also be relevant to the broader question of how            
              gene expression is regulated by chromosome condensation. Such a                
              mechanism is thought to be critical to normal development of                   
              eukaryotic organisms.
