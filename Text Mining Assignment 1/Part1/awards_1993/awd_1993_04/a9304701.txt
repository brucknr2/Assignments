Abstract    :
                   The impact of Hurricane Iniki on native Hawaiian forest was               
              highly variable.  Preliminary observations suggested that native               
              trees were less damaged than introduced species.  The spatial                  
              pattern of damage seemed to be related to soil wetness, a prime                
              factor limiting tree root depth.  The productivity of forests                  
              should be affected by removal of leaves, death of fine roots, and              
              nutrient accumulation by fallen leaves and twings.  In areas                   
              which were not severely damaged by the hurricane, a new mechanism              
              may be identified whereby sub-catastrophic storms help maintain                
              the unique even-aged population structure of native Metrosideros               
              forests.  This research will test hypotheses on mechanisms                     
              controlling these apparent patterns, and will measure (1) the                  
              spatial pattern of damage, (2) damage by size class and species,               
              (3) changes in leaf area and growth rate, (4) changes in fine                  
              root biomass, (5) decomposition of leaves and twigs, and (6)                   
              changes in soil nutrient availability.
