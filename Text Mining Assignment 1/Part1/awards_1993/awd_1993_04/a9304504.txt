Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Layered ice deposits found in shallow saline lakes in southern                 
              Bolivia and northern Chile may provide the first high-resolution               
              record of climatic change from the arid-subtropical region of the              
              Andes.  The ice deposits rise as much as 7 m above the surface of              
              shallow saline lakes and extend to unknown depths.  The deposits               
              are covered by a white carbonate crust and the layers alternate                
              between freshwater ice and ice mixed with sediment.  The sites are             
              located in a very arid region (<100 mm a.1 mean annual                         
              precipitation) where mean annual temperatures range from 3.6o to               
              9.6oC.  The deposits are presently melting, which indicates they               
              are not in equilibrium with the modern climatic regime.  Ice cores             
              will be retrieved from the ice deposits beginning with the largest             
              deposit, which is found in Laguna Colorada (22o10'S,4289m), to                 
              determine the potential of these deposits as archives of high-                 
              resolution climatic change.  A transect of cores across the                    
              deposits will indicate whether or not the layers are horizontally              
              continuous.  The cores will also provide the material for isotopic,            
              chemical, and mineral analyses, which are needed to determine when             
              and how the layers formed.  Mono-pulse radar soundings will help to            
              determine how thick the deposits are and the potential need for a              
              mechanical drill to obtain a long record.  High lake levels and                
              glacial advances indicate there was a significant change in the                
              hydrologic budget in the subtropical region of the Andes during the            
              late Pleistocene.  This change was probably caused by two factors:             
              a southward shift of the Intertropical Convergence Zone, which                 
              lengthened the rainy season, and colder temperatures.  Pr1eliminary            
              results indicate that the layered ice deposits may have started to             
              form during this late-Pleistocene interval and therefore could                 
              provide a unique record of climatic change for this region.
