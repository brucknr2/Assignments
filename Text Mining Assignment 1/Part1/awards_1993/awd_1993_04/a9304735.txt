Abstract    :
              9304735  Gwanmesia       This award provides partial funding for equipment that
              will be  assembled and operated in the Department of Physics nd Astronomy at 
              Delaware State college.  The equipment will enable the Principal  Investigator
              and his students to establish an ultrasonic  interferometry system for the
              measurement of sound velocities  through mineral and rock samples.  Such
              measurements are important  constraints on seismological models of the Earth's
              internal  structure.  ***
