Abstract    :
              The proposed project will correlate deposits and individual                    
              strata with recorded hydrovolcanic eruptive events at the                      
              Ukinrek Maars, Alaska, in order to understand the processes                    
              involved in eruption and emplacement of phreatomagmatic                        
              deposits.  Our results will provide a means for inferring                      
              diverse phreatomagmatic eruption styles from the                               
              characteristics of deposits in places where the eruptions                      
              were not observed.  The underlying reason for this research                    
              is to aid understanding of hydrovolcanic processes for                         
              hazards assessments.  Hydrovolcanic eruptions commonly                         
              include "blast" events that are among the most devastating                     
              and hazardous of all eruptions.  It is of fundamental                          
              importance for hazards evaluations to recognize these                          
              deposits, as they are commonly mistaken for re-worked                          
              volcanic deposits.
