Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This conference, "Materials by Design", is to be held in Plymouth,             
              New Hampshire, 2-6 August 1993.  It is a forum for interaction of              
              the leading developers of computational models with the emerging               
              group of design scientists applying these models in first attempts             
              at comprehensive design of new materials.  Subject areas to be                 
              covered include materials design, multifunctional materials,                   
              thermodynamics and associated data bases, phase stability, electron            
              theory related to alloy design, modeling tools, computational                  
              methods, and interface design.  The emphasis is on materials                   
              theory, but includes other subjects such as processing of cast                 
              intermetallics and weldability.  There is an effort to attract                 
              young investigators, as well as an international group of                      
              scientists to the conference.                                                  
              %%%                                                                            
              The conference subject is aimed at bringing efficiency to material             
              design by incorporating new theoretical approaches into the design             
              process.
