Abstract    :
                  9304369  Green    This proposal addresses the mechanisms for expression of
              pattern in  the plant shoot. The aim is to explain a) the origin of pattern, b)
               its propagation, i.e. phyllotaxis, and c) change of pattern as in  flower
              mutants. Organ pattern is first seen in the arrangement of  folds or bumps in
              the surface layer of the apical dome, the tunica.  Current theory usually
              postulates that a chemical pre-pattern is  first generated by diffusing
              inhibitors or morphogens and then  converted, congruently, to solid tissue
              configuration. It is  proposed here to further pursue an alternate hypothesis
              where  pattern is directly generated in the tissue itself by physical laws  of
              the solid state, i.e. buckling theory based on the von Karman  equations. The
              research plan is as follows: Selected developmental  progressions will be
              characterized by a non-destructive SEM replica  technique to determine the
              precise course of tissue folding and  cell growth in vivo. Parallel computer
              simulations will determine  the extent to which buckling theory can account for
              the observed  progressions. Dr. Green will study vegetative shoots and 
              morphological floral mutants (concentric and blind in Petunia).  Further
              testing involves responses to physical constraint and the  local application of
              morphogenetically active compounds. This  research will clarify the biophysics
              of morphogenesis and its  modulation by diffusing agents.  ***
