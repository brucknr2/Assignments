Abstract    :
                   Professor Canary's work concerns the relationship between                 
              the geometry and the topology of hyperbolic 3-manifolds.  In the               
              past he has explored the consequences of knowing that a                        
              hyperbolic 3-manifold is topologically tame, i.e. homeomorphic to              
              the interior of a compact 3-manifold.  In particular, he studied               
              the spectral geometry and the dynamics of topologically tame                   
              hyperbolic 3-manifolds.  One application was a proof of Ahlfors'               
              measure conjecture for topologically tame hyperbolic 3-manifolds.              
              In this project he intends to study the question of which                      
              hyperbolic 3-manifolds are topologically tame.  The conjecture is              
              that every hyperbolic 3-manifold with finitely generated                       
              fundamental group is topologically tame.  He also intends to                   
              study the space of all hyperbolic structures on a given                        
              3-manifold.                                                                    
                   An n-manifold is an object such that about every point there              
              is a neighborhood which looks like a ball in n-dimensional space.              
              For example, the unit sphere (in 3-dimensional space) is a                     
              2-manifold, since about each point there is a small neighborhood               
              which looks like a disk in the plane.  One natural way in which                
              manifolds arise is as solution sets of equations in several                    
              variables.  For example, the unit sphere is the solution set of a              
              particularly simple equation (x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1).  A metric on               
              a manifold M is a way of measuring distances between points on M.              
              A manifold may admit many different metrics.  For example, the                 
              unit sphere and the surface of an apple are topologically the                  
              same manifold, but they have different metrics.  Studying the                  
              types of possible metrics on a manifold has many applications in               
              mathematics and physics.  The investigator will study metrics on               
              3-manifolds such that about any point there is a small                         
              neighborhood which may be identified (by an identification which               
              preserves distances) with a ball in hyperbolic 3-space.  These                 
              metrics are called hyperbolic metrics.  Hyperbolic metrics on                  
              2-manifolds have recently been of great interest to physicists,                
              in particular, to string theorists.
