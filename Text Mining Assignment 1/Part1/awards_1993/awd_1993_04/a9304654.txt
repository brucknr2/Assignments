Abstract    :
                   PIs will document environmental changes in shallow-water                  
              fauna, associated with emergence of the Isthmus of Panama.  Using              
              stable isotope analyses of surface- and bottom-dwelling                        
              foraminifera, they will 1) determine age of final closure of the               
              seaway; 2) document environmental divergence on either side of the             
              isthmus, and 3) generate chronologic profiles of environmental                 
              conditions across the shelf through the period of circulatory                  
              restriction and cutoff.  Study will be integrated with ongoing work            
              on mollusks and deep-sea forams.  Together studies should provide              
              framework for interpreting evolutionary and ecological patterns                
              associated with this event.
