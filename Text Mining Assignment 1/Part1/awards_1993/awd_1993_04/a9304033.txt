Abstract    :
              9304033  Weidner         This is a project to examine the phase equilibria for
              the  olivine system at the pressures and temperatures of the 400 km 
              discontinuity.  The experiments will be  carried out with SAM-85,  a cubic
              anvil high pressure system used in conjunction with the  NSLS synchrotron.  The
              major advantage of this system is that the  pressure in the sample cell is
              continuously monitored.  This is  essential to directly associate a seismic
              discontinuity at depth  in the earth with a phase transition observed in the
              lab where the  pressure scale may be precise but inaccurate.  ***
