Abstract    :
              9304986  Jeanloz      This project initiates a community-wide study of the
              core-mantle boundary, one of the most significant regions of our planet.  As a
              result of the past decade's research advances, the geosciences community is on
              the verge of making significant breakthroughs in understanding how the Earth
              evolves on a global scale.  Because the dynamics of the deep planetary interior
              involves many different facets of the Earth sciences, from geomagnetism and
              seismology to mineral physics and geodynamics, a multi-disciplinary approach is
              essential.  An average of less than $30 K/yr for each investigator will allow
              them to pursue this effort in a truly collaborative and interdisciplinary
              manner.  This project will yield important new observations and theoretical
              analyses bearing on the core-mantle boundary, and will support the
              participation of the broader community of interested geoscientists. 
              Significant advances in our understanding of the Earth's geological evolution
              -- far beyond what would be achieved by the individual groups working
              separately -- will result from this collaborative, multi-disciplinary effort.
