Abstract    :
              9304553  Houston    This research is a continuation of the search for a
              mechanism for  deep earthquakes, one of the most important unresolved problems
              in  geophysics.  The work proposed here includes the assembly and  analysis of
              broadband displacement waveforms of about 150 large  deep earthquakes that
              occurred during 1987-1992.  Events from 1982-  1986 showed a decrease in rise
              times of the P wave with earthquake  origin depth.  This is one of the few
              characteristics that shows  a correlation with depth.  The results will be used
              to test  proposed mechanisms for deep earthquakes including phase 
              transformations in the subducting slab.  The results will also be  compared
              with finite-difference modeling of the slab structure on  waveforms and stress
              orientations from the Harvard CMT catalog.   Integration of seismological and
              mineral physics results will  further the evaluation of hypotheses of slab
              structure and deep  earthquake generation.  ***
