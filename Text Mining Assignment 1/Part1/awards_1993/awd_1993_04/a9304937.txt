Abstract    :
              9304937  Livingston  The yeast RAD52 gene plays a central role in chromosome 
              maintenance.  Its importance is illustrated by the severe defects  mutant cells
              have in repairing damaged DNA, recombining  chromosomes, and in completing
              melotic division.  The role of the  protein product has not been defined.  This
              project is examining  the genetics of RAD52.  The study begins with the
              characterization  of temperature-sensitive alleles, which we have isolated,
              having  defects in either DNA repair or chromosome recombination.  These 
              mutants are then used to find extragenic suppressors.  Such  suppressors will
              identify other genes whose products interact with  Rad52p, the protein product
              of RAD52.  The temperature-sensitive  alleles, as well as a truncation allele
              which is able to sporulate,  are next used to study the role of Rad52p in
              meiosis. Molecular  studies include an examination of protein-protein
              interactions:  between Rad52p polypeptide selected through a fusion library of 
              yeast proteins.  Another molecular study includes the examination  of the
              extent with which the temperature-sensitive and other  recombination-proficient
              RAD52 mutants resect double strand breaks  in vivo.  %%%  This research is
              concerned with two processes important to all  organisms: genetic recombination
              and repair of DNA.  ***
