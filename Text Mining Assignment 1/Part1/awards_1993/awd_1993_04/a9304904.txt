Abstract    :
                   This award will provide essential computational resources,                
              to several on-going research projects in number theory, algebra,               
              and algebraic geometry.  These projects cover the related areas                
              of representation theory; modular forms and elliptic curves; the               
              topology of algebraic varieties and Picard-Fuchs, differential                 
              equations; and Arakelov theory, K-theory, and arithmetic                       
              geometry.  The investigators plan variously to apply symbolic                  
              algebra programs, such as REDUCE, Maple, Macaulay, to these                    
              problems; to develop packages of procedures in these languages;                
              and to develop programs in lower level languages such as FORTRAN               
              and C.  In addition, the equipment will be used to support                     
              graduate students working in these areas.
