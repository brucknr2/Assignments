Abstract    :
               9304021  Evans  This research proposal combines field work, structural 
              measurements and interpretation, petrography, phase  petrology,
              thermobarometry, and isotopic age determinations  in the Nason Terrane of the
              state of Washington.  The  purpose of the study is to examine critically the
              field  evidence on which the recently proposed tectonic model  termed magma
              loading is based.   The model implies  coincidences in timing between
              plutonism, metamorphism and  deformation, spatial relationships among plutons
              and the  distribution and history or pressure and temperature, and  flexuring
              events producing and then eliminating steep baric  gradients.  The proposed
              research has major implications for  crust-building and metamorphic processes
              in large-volume  magmatic arcs.
