Abstract    :
                   This project is concerned with an international workshop on               
              "Digital Video for Intelligent Systems (July 8 and 9, 1993 at                  
              University of California, Irvine)".  The objectives of this                    
              Workshop are to review the state-of-the-art and to identify future             
              trends in Digital Video Technology for Intelligent Systems.  The               
              application of machine intelligence range from sophisticated                   
              computer-based systems for industry, medicine and science to                   
              simpler systems for the home.  Examples include computer-aided                 
              design, transportation systems, visualization of phenomena in                  
              scientific experiments, business systems, adaptive control, robotic            
              vision, computer-aided education, modeling of human anatomy and                
              physiology, large visual data bases, personal communications, and              
              intelligent appliances for the home.  Digital video is a                       
              fundamental enabling technology for most of these intelligent                  
              systems.  This Workshop is intended to foster further collaboration            
              among academic and industrial researchers including government                 
              agencies and public institutions, in the field of digital video for            
              intelligent systems.
