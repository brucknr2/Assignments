Abstract    :
                   The rare gases (helium, neon, argon, krypton, and xenon) are              
              important geochemical tracers. Their elemental abundances are                  
              useful in understanding the physical and chemical processes                    
              responsible for the formation of rocks, meteorites, seawater,                  
              groundwater, and the atmosphere. Their radiogenic isotopes (e.g.,              
              helium-4, argon-40, xenon-129) provide important time constraints              
              on geological events. The high-precision analysis required for                 
              geological interpretations based on extremely small abundances of              
              these rare gases require state-of-the-art mass spectrometric                   
              techniques. This award will provide 50% of the funds required to               
              purchase a modern mass spectrometer system for noble gases. The                
              instrument will be installed and maintained in the Division of                 
              Geological and Planetary Sciences at the California Institute of               
              Technology. The Institute is committed to providing the remaining              
              funds necessary for the acquisition. Specific research projects                
              that will make use of the facility include work on mantle chemical             
              evolution, crustal fluids, surface-exposure dating, and solar                  
              system evolution.
