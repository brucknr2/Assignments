Abstract    :
              The immediate objectives of this project are to determine                      
              the distribution of metamorphic zones, the peak metamorphic                    
              temperatures and pressures, and the P-T paths for granulite                    
              facies rocks of the Adirondack Mountains.  Mineral analyses                    
              obtained by electron microprobe will be used with P-T-X                        
              calculations to constrain peak metamorphic conditions, and                     
              mineral zoning determined by techniques such as X-ray                          
              mapping will elucidate the reaction histories necessary to                     
              infer P-T paths.  The results will ultimately provide                          
              constraints on the origin of the metamorphism and on the                       
              nature of  associated tectonic processes.
