Abstract    :
              9304691  Chen  In this project of the Physical Chemistry Program in the 
              Chemistry Division, Prof. Y. Chen of the University of  California at Berkeley
              will pursue a program of research to  provide a systematic understanding of the
              interplay between  intramolecular energy transfer and chemical reactions.  To
              this  end the new technique of femtosecond time-domain Transient  Stimulated
              Emission Pumping (TSEP) spectroscopy invented by him  will be applied to two
              model systems, ozone and methylnitrite  to obtain real-time emission spectra
              during the  photofragmentation of these species.  %%%  The details of chemical
              reaction and dissociation processes  occur at pico- to femtosecond time scales
              and research in this  field is at the forefront of contemporary physical
              chemistry.  Among the questions posed by these processes is how the energy 
              which excites a specific molecular vibrational state  redistributes itself
              within the molecule to result in the  dissociation of the molecule by the
              breaking of a specific  chemical bond or in the molecular rearrangement into a 
              different conformational structure.  The STEP method possesses  several
              distinct advantages over other techniques currently in  use: it is capable of
              furnishing both time and frequency  information, the spectral assignments are
              unambiguous, and it  has high sensitivity.  These make the STEP method an ideal
              tool  for studying the energy transfer and chemical reactions in  polyatomic
              systems.  ***
