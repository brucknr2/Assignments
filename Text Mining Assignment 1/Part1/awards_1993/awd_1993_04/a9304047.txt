Abstract    :
              9304047  Johnson       This award provides 68 percent of the funding required
              for the  acquisition of an ultra-precise surveying system or "total station" 
              that will be used by the Principal Investigator and colleagues and  students in
              the Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at  Purdue University. The
              University is committed to providing the  remaining funds needed for the
              acquisition.       The total station system combines an electronic theodolite
              and  an electronic distance measurement device with computer processing  to
              establish mapping control points in an x, y, z geometric  reference frame for
              creating detailed geologic maps with sub-  millimeter precision.  ***
