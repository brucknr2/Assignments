Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The National Academy of Sciences, through its Ocean Studies                    
              Board (OSB), will provide guidance to the National Science                     
              Foundation/Division of Ocean Sciences and other Federal agencies               
              on major ocean science and policy issues.  This request is for                 
              continued Core Support for the OSB. The OSB plans to consider                  
              scientific issues related to coastal oceanography, the carbon                  
              dioxide cycle, fisheries  oceanography, marine molecular biology,              
              "Oceanography in the 1990's", and the Roger Revelle Distinguished              
              Lecture Series-- over the next few years. The OSB will also                    
              support U.S. ocean scientist to provide leadership in these areas              
              internationally, through support of the participation in the                   
              Scientific Committee of Oceanic Research (SCOR) of the                         
              International Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU).  The OSB will,              
              thus, continue to  contribute to maintaining the health of ocean               
              sciences in the United States.
