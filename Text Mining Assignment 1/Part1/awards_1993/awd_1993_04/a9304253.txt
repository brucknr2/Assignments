Abstract    :
                   PI and associate will search for fossil echinoderms in                    
              targeted Upper Cambrian strata.  Late Cambrian time is critical in             
              echinoderm evolution because it marked the transition between the              
              archaic Cambrian fauna and the newly appearing "Paleozoic" fauna.              
              Results from this work with be used to reconstruct phylogeny and               
              evolutionary history of the echinoderms, determine their                       
              paleoecologic settings, and test for possible environmental                    
              controls on their history.
