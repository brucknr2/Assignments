Abstract    :
              9304786  Goelman  The proposed work aims to improve the Hadamard spectroscopic 
              imaging technique to permit spatial imaging of metabolic  intermediates and pH
              in intact cells and tissues.  The specific  aims are to: (1) develop a
              technique to minimize rf peak amplitude  in the multiple inversion band pulses,
              (2) correct for chemical  shift localization errors, (3) extend the formalism
              used to  describe and develop the multiple inversion pulses, and (4) to  write
              software to run the Hadamard experiment.  %%%  The proposed research is aimed
              at improving magnetic resonance  spectroscopic imaging.  Current progress in
              imaging has been based  on water imaging.  The proposed research involves other
              nuclei,  principally phosphorous, of importance to cellular metabolism.  
              Obtaining spatial information about metabolites will broaden the  applicability
              and specificity of magnetic resonance imaging.  The  main problems with imaging
              molecules other than water have been  technical.  The proposed work will
              contribute significantly towards  the goal of solving theses technical
              difficulties.  ***
