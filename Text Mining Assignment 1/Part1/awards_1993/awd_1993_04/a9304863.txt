Abstract    :
                   Many major mountain systems of the world are in part                      
              the result of large scale compression of the crust in what                     
              are termed, fold-and-thrust belts.  The style of  formation                    
              of such belts is controversial.  One school of thought                         
              reckons that they form in a manner similar to deforming snow                   
              ahead of a plow ("critical taper model"), whereas the other                    
              advocates formation by the compression of a beam.  This                        
              project proposes an experiement to test these two hypotheses                   
              using field relations in the Pyrenees Mountains of Spain.                      
              This will be an important experiment because the method of                     
              geometric reconstruction commonly used to model deformed                       
              terranes, especially hydrocarbon-bearing reservoirs, depend                    
              in large part on the assumption of deformational style.
