Abstract    :
                   Political processes can have profound impacts on the                      
              structure and operation of spaces.  Changes in political                       
              processes may produce new ways to organize and use space, a                    
              fundamental fact that once again is being demonstrated in the                  
              nations of central Europe and northern Eurasia that recently                   
              replaced communist regimes with more democratic governments.                   
              This doctoral dissertation improvement project will focus on the               
              relationship between political activism and community identity in              
              post-Soviet cities of Russia.  Special emphasis will be given to               
              assessing the role of political activism in the formation of new               
              community and territorial identities within cities and the degree              
              to which those new identities affect the agendas and behavior of               
              people active in politics.  Archival research, detailed                        
              interviews, and surveys will be used to conduct a comparative                  
              analysis of 'committees of self-governance' in Moscow, and                     
              secondary data will be examined to determine broader political                 
              and economic trends in urban centers throughout Russia.                        
                   This research will provide valuable information and insights              
              into the dramatic transformations of political and urban                       
              structure in Russia, and it also will extend and refine theories               
              developed in Western contexts regarding reciprocal interactions                
              between place and politics.  As a doctoral dissertation                        
              improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable              
              a promising student to establish a strong independent research                 
              career.
