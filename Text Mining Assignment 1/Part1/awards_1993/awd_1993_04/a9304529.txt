Abstract    :
              9304529  Johnson    This award supports a paleoenvironmental investigation of
              Lake  Victoria under the auspices of the International Decade for the  East
              African Lakes (IDEAL).  A seismic reflection and side-scan  sonar survey will
              be conducted to delineate modern sedimentary  environments, determine previous
              lowstand shorelines, locate and  measure thick sedimentary sequences, and
              identify promising core  sites for the recovery of 20 meter sediment cores. 
              The primary  objective is to reconstruct a detailed environmental and climatic 
              history of Lake Victoria and its environs over the last 15,000  years, and
              compare that record within the regional and global  network of sites showing
              decadal and century-scale rapid climate  change.  This work will provide a
              chronologically robust, high  resolution, multi-proxy mapping of the Lake
              Victoria system's  response and sensitivity to climate variation.  This work
              will be  undertaken in close collaboration with the African scientific 
              community.  ***
