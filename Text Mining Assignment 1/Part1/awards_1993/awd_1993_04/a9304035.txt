Abstract    :
              9304035  Khomami    An investigation is to be carried out on the interfacial 
              stability and dynamic deformation of multilayer polymeric  fluids subjected to
              shear and extensional deformation. The  approach is a mix of modeling and
              experiments. The modeling  component consists of theoretical stability
              analysis,  including three dimensional and finite amplitude instability  modes.
              The experiments will use various polymer melts in  straight and converging
              channels to simulate a co-extrusion  environment. Theoretical and experimental
              findings regarding  layer deformation and stability will be compared.       
              Multilayer coextrusion and coating is an important process in  the formation of
              polymeric composite materials. Under certain  processing conditions,
              instabilities can arise, and these  cannot at present be reliably predicted.
