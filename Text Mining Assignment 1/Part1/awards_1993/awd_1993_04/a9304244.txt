Abstract    :
              The Department of Statistics at the University of Illinois,  Urbana-Champaign,
              will purchase computing equipment which will be  dedicated to the support of
              research in mathematical sciences.   The equipment will support several
              research projects, including  in particular calibration of random curves
              including algorithm  for high-dimensional parameter estimation, bootstrap
              prediction  and calibration regions, and high-dimensional visualization; 
              multidimensional analysis of rank data including graphics for  multidimensional
              unfolding models, symbolic computation of exact  means and variances in
              rank-based analysis-of-variance, and  extensions of univariate rank-based
              nonparametric procedures to  multiple dimensions; latent trait modeling of
              educational test  data with applications test fairness assessment and test 
              dimensionality analysis, including the development of software  for general
              distribution; regression modeling and curve fitting  methods for conditional
              quantiles including algorithm development  and dynamical graphics for selecting
              curve smoothness.
