Abstract    :
              A workshop to consider the future of programming languages and                 
              compilers research will be held in Charleston, S.C., on                        
              January 13-14, l993, immediately after the Principles of                       
              Programming Languages (POPL) conference.  fifteen to twenty                    
              researchers, representing a cross-section of the programming                   
              languages community, from both senior and junior levels in                     
              universities and industry shall be invited to participate.                     
              The workshop will focus both on the direction of future                        
              research and on fostering communication within the area and                    
              with other areas.                                                              
                                                                                             
              An attempt to clarify issues such as:                                          
                                                                                             
                   What developments in the field will have the greatest                     
                   impact on science and technology in the near term? In the                 
                   long term?                                                                
                                                                                             
                   How can connections between theory and practice be more                   
                   fully exploited?                                                          
                                                                                             
                   How can researchers in this field facilitate technology                   
                   transfer to other scientific areas and the programming                    
                   community at large?                                                       
                                                                                             
              will be made and presented in a report, edited by the PI's in                  
              consultation with the workshop participants summarizing the                    
              consensus of the meeting.
