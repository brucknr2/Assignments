Abstract    :
                    9304076  Poole    The long term objectives of the project are to
              understand how genes  interact during development to specify a complex body
              plan in  higher organisms. Several cell type specific transcription factors  in
              mammals share a two part DNA binding domain known as the POU  domain. POU
              domain proteins play a variety of roles in vertebrate  development. The closely
              linked pdm-1 and pdm-2 genes of Drosophila  also share this domain and are most
              closely related to the  mammalian Oct-1 and Oct-2 POU domain genes. Their
              developmental  expression patterns, responses to genes that organize the body 
              plan, and effects of their misexpression together suggest that the  pdm genes
              play important roles in regulating different aspects of  Drosophila
              development. In addition, the study of this class of  genes in Drosophila
              should give fresh insights into the structures  and functions of the mammalian
              genes. The overall aims of this  project are to understand the roles these
              presumed transcription  factors play in Drosophila development. Specific aims
              are to  generate chromosomal deficiencies in the pdm gene region to narrow 
              down the genetic area in which to search for mutations. To predict  the effects
              of mutations on development, phenocopies of pdm  mutations will be induced by
              injecting antisense oligonucleotides  into early embryos. To generate mutations
              in the individual pdm  genes, the chromosomal region will be saturated for
              lethal  mutations induced by the mutagen EMS. After identifying the  different
              genes in the region, the effects on development of  specific mutations in the
              pdm genes will indicate in which  processes the genes are involved.  ***
