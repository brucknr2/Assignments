Abstract    :
              9304843  Edmond       Unrestricted access and sampling is currently possible in
              the  great rivers of the Russian Far East.  Two very successful  expeditions
              have taken place to the Aldan, the major tributary of  the Upper Lena (1991),
              and to the Kolyma (1992).  All significant  tributaries were sampled for water
              chemistry and for their  suspended and bed material.  The data now available
              for the Aldan  system clearly show the effects of frost cracking in
              accelerating  weathering in this periglacial environment.  The Archean Aldan 
              Shield appears to weather at rates at least an order of magnitude  faster than
              its Tropical analogue, The Guayana Shield in the  Orinoco drainage.  Similarily
              the rates of weathering of the  platform carbonates of the Lena Plateau are not
              inhibited by the  low temperatures.  Concentration levels during the period of
              summer  flow are comparable to those of the Yangtze, which drains  geologically
              similar terrain.  These comparison give insight on the  effects of climatic
              deterioration on the geochemical cycle, a topic  of much general interest at
              the present time.  It is planned to  extend this work to the main stem of the
              Upper Lena and to the  other large rivers of the region, the Indigrika, Yana,
              Anadyr and  Amur.  ***
