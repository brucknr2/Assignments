Abstract    :
                   Major tectonic deformation of mountain systems can                        
              occur as the result of chemical dissolution that occurs                        
              under directed stress.  This process creates zones of rock                     
              that become depleted in chemical elements that are most                        
              susceptible to removal and replacement.  Quantification of                     
              the amount of strain in rocks changed by this process is                       
              elusive because it is difficult to determine how much                          
              material has been removed.  This project will measure this                     
              effect by comparing the bulk chemical content of deformed                      
              zones with adjoining undeformed zones.  Development of this                    
              technique will provide others with the methodology to allow                    
              routine analysis of such rocks.
