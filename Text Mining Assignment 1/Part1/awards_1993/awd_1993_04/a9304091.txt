Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Workshop on an Infrastructure for Temporal Databases                           
                                                                                             
              The objective of this workshop is to define and establish a common             
              infrastructure for temporal databases.  The infrastructure                     
              establishes a common technical vocabulary, identifies specific data            
              modeling and query language needs arising from potential temporal              
              DBMS users, identifies concepts and technologies from other data               
              handling areas that could be profitably applied to temporal                    
              databases, specifies a single temporal relational data model, lists            
              the specific language features that should be included in a                    
              temporal query language, specifies a database schema and example               
              queries that will aid in comparing query language proposals,                   
              outlines and populates a DBMS architecture with established query              
              processing approaches, storage structures, and access methods,                 
              states the features that should be present in next-generation                  
              temporal data models and query languages, characterizes the                    
              research questions that are most pressing, and includes                        
              recommendations for funding and for building additional                        
              infrastructure in the temporal DBMS community. The workshop                    
              participants will communicate this infrastructure through a                    
              consensus document that will be widely circulated to the research,             
              development, management and planning communities and funding                   
              agencies.  This document will contain technical results and                    
              recommendations and will provide a foundation for implementation,              
              standardization and future research.
