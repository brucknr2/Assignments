Abstract    :
                   Fault slip within zones of oblique convergence or                         
              divergence may be partitioned                                                  
              on separate but coexisting and coplanar strike-slip and dip-                   
              slip faults.  This work has major implications for                             
              earthquake hazards in terms of predicting the kinds of                         
              shaking may be expected along a given fault zone, i.e.,                        
              vertical vs. horizontal ground accelerations.  This project                    
              will also test the notion that the coexistence of coplanar                     
              and coexisting dip- and strike-slip faults require that                        
              rapid changes occur in the local stress field.  This                           
              proposal will document the location and character of slip                      
              partitioning along faults of the Walker Lane belt and                          
              western Basin and Range Province.
