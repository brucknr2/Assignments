Abstract    :
              9304345  Lockley       In this renewal, PI and collaborator A. Hunt will conduct
               further studies of biostratigraphy, and paleoecology and  systematics of
              vertebrate tracks on the Colorado Plateau, where the  record is exceptional. 
              PI will expand, curate and synthesize his  data base, going into older strata
              than most previous work; fossils  will be placed in a new repository
              established by his institution.   Work will allow new and better correlations,
              and assemblage data  will also provide insights into the composition, diversity
              and  distribution of communities.  ***
