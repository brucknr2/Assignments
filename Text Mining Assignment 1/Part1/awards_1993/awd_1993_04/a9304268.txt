Abstract    :
              9304268  Skeel       The investigator continues work on numerical methods for 
              molecular dynamics.  The objective is to find numerical  algorithms suitable
              for large parallel computers that can much  more efficiently model the dynamics
              of macromolecules such as  proteins, DNA, and lipids.  Emphasis is on the use
              of integration  schemes, notably symplectic schemes, that can use large time 
              steps to produce qualitatively correct simulations for long-time  integrations.
               The goal is to obtain the desired information with  the least computational
              effort, and the methodology is to  use mathematical analysis and computational
              experiments on  model problems.  The techniques developed are to be tested on 
              realistic molecular models as part of a different, complementary  research
              project involving software development.  Among the  techniques to be
              considered, the better known ones are multiple  time steps, constraint
              dynamics, and fast Coulomb solvers.       Mathematical formulas and computer
              programs are being  devised that can predict typical motions of large molecules
              such  as proteins and DNA.  The aim is find shortcuts that enable very  fast
              calculations on large computers.  These ideas are tested  for accuracy and
              speed, and the more useful ones are put into  the software that biologists and
              other scientists use to study  the action of molecules.  Computer simulations
              can help the  scientist to understand how molecules perform biological 
              functions, which can be very difficult to observe experimentally.   Such
              studies are also useful in the design of molecules for  agricultural and
              medical purposes.  ***
