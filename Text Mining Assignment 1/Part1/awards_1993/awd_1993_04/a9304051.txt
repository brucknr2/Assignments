Abstract    :
              9314051  Fagerstrom  Despite more than 80 years of research on the renowned
              Permian  "reef" complex of the Delaware Basin (New Mexico/West Texas), there 
              have been no detailed studies of the very abundant sponges in this  bioherm. 
              PIs will a) identify and describe the sponges to species  level and interpret
              their phylogenetic significance; 2) assess the  biostratigraphic value of these
              species and evaluate effects of the  Permo-Triassic mass extinction on this
              group of sponges; 3) address  paleobiogeographic issues with respect to these
              sponges; and 4)  conduct a paleoecologic analysis of the algal-sponge
              community.
