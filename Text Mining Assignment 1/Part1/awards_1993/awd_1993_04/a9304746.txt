Abstract    :
              9304746  Speicher  This proposal seeks to describe the mechanism by which alpha 
              actinin forms homodimers.  The approach is primarily biochemical,  involving
              chemical cross-linking and site directed mutagenesis.  %%%  Alpha actinin is
              involved in the organization and function of  muscle and is also involved in
              cell-to-cell and cell-to-substratum  adhesion.  Electron microscopic studies
              have resulted in low  resolution models for alpha actinin structure, which
              involve alpha  actinin dimers.  The protein chemical studies proposed will 
              establish at an atomic level whether the current model is correct  and will
              further refine our understanding of the function of this  important
              representative of a class of organizational biomolecules.  ***
