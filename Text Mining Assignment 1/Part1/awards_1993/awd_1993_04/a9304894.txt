Abstract    :
              The objectives of this research project are to obtain PVT                      
              data at simultaneous high temperatures and high pressures                      
              for carbonates and CO2, to use carbonates to understand the                    
              high pressure-temperature behavior of phases containing non-                   
              spherical anions, and to establish a set of internally                         
              consistent equations of state of H2O, CO2, and the                             
              carbonates.  The in-situ diffraction patterns that form the                    
              basis for this experimental study will be collected using                      
              synchrotron radiation and a resistance heated diamond anvil                    
              cell that is capable of reaching temperatures and pressures                    
              up to 1100oC and 2.5 GPa.  The results of the research will                    
              ultimately find application in modelling the behavior of                       
              fluids in deep crustal and mantle environments.
