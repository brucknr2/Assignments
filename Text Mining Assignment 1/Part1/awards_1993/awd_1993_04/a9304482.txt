Abstract    :
                   Many modern and ancient mountain systems can be                           
              characterized as foreland fold-thrust belts.  These systems                    
              have major economic significance in that they are a major                      
              habitat for oil and gas.  Detachment folds are a common                        
              structure in these terranes, but their abundance and overall                   
              significance are poorly known and understood.  This study                      
              will provide an in-depth analysis of the 3-D  character of                     
              these structure that will allow for the development of more                    
              complete models for the formation of foreland fold-thrust                      
              belts.
