Abstract    :
              9304555  Langston    This research is to conduct a study of the crustal and
              upper  mantle structure in Tanzania by means of passive-source seismic 
              recording with the PASSCAL array and by means of analysis of  gravity data. 
              The existence of thick, depleted mantle lithosphere  beneath ancient
              continental regions forms the basis of the model  for deep continental
              structure.  A principal assertion of this  model is that  cratonic nuclei with
              their lithospheric keels are  true islands of tectonic stability within a
              generally mobile and  less stable lithosphere.  This work will test this model
              of deep  continental structure by examining the stability of cratonic 
              lithosphere in an area of active tectonism, East Africa.  The  cratonic
              lithosphere in East Africa (the Tanzania Craton) has been  subjected to
              Cenozoic extensional tectonism,  providing a unique  opportunity to determine
              if deep cratonic structure can "survive"  an extensional event which has
              thermally and mechanically disrupted  adjacent younger lithosphere.  Similar
              structures in the U.S. are  the sites of current seismic activity and these
              results will bear  on the mechanism of the earthquake generating structure. 
              This  research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction 
              Program.  ***
