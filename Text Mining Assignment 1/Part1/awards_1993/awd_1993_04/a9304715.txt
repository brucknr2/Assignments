Abstract    :
              9304715  Serpa       The deformation of continental crust along transform  plate
              boundaries involves the interaction of large-scale  crustal fragments that my
              rotate about both vertical and  horizontal axes and are bounded by combinations
              of strike-  slip, normal and thrust fault domains.  Models for these  types of
              interactions lead to significant space and time  problems as the blocks
              interact, particularly at the corners  of blocks.  This project will examine
              the sinistral eastern  Garlock-dextral southern Death Valley fault intersection
               from surface structures and shallow seismic data.  Increased  knowledge on the
              4-dimensional behavior of this complex  intersection are expected to develop
              the deformational  sequence experienced in this experienced in this example and
               to provide a guide to extending this information to other,  less well exposed,
              system elsewhere.
