Abstract    :
              This research involves the investigation of the asymptotic  properties of
              sequences of random variables with various types of  dependence.  By relating
              weak dependent sequences to semiamarts  and demimartingales we shall clarify
              some aspects of the almost  sure convergence of these sequences. Other part of
              this research   will  study two estimators of the variance of the sample mean 
              based on dependent data. These estimators are suggested by  blocking techniques
              and robust statistical procedures such as the  bootstrap and the jackknife. The
              estimators can be used as  selfnormalizers in the Central Limit Theorem.  One
              of the main problems of statistics is to provide interval  estimates for some
              unknown parameters. These confidence intervals  are constructed based on an
              estimator of the parameter and an  error given by the variability of this
              estimator. The purpose of  this research is to study this problem in the case
              when the data  is dependent.
