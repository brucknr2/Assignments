Abstract    :
                    9304394  Poccia    The long term goal of this work is to understand the 
              inactivation/activation of the sperm nucleus that occurs during 
              spermatogenesis and following fertilization. Successful genetic  reactivation
              of the dormant sperm nucleus by egg cytoplasm is  essential to successful
              biparental embryonic development. Male  pronuclear reactivation is preceded by
              decondensation of chromatin  and alteration of DNA associated basic proteins.
              Dr. Poccia will  test the abilities of two sperm specific histones of the sea
              urchin  (Sp H1 and Sp H2B) to determine first order structure of sperm 
              chromatin and its alteration following fertilization. His model  predicts that
              phosphorylation of "SPKK" sites in the N-terminal  domains of these molecules
              controls average nucleosomal repeat  length and accessibility of linker DNA to
              enzymatic digestion.  These properties have been previously correlated in vivo,
              but  whether N-terminal phosphorylation plays a role in determining  repeat
              lengths or sensitivity to MNase digestion is a major  untested postulate. Novel
              features of his experiments include the  use of identical histone variants
              which differ in degree of  phosphorylation, employment of N- and C-terminal
              peptide as well as  intact molecules to assess the contribution of those
              domains, and  evaluation of the contributions of H2B as well as H1. Relevance
              of  "SPKK" phosphorylation extends beyond Sp histones. Similar sites  occur in
              most H1's and in several nucleic acid packaging proteins  and regulators, some
              of which are phosphorylated in a cell cycle  dependent manner. Moreover,
              positioning of nucleosomes and  alteration of histone-DNA binding affinities is
              critically  important in replication and transcriptional control mechanisms.
