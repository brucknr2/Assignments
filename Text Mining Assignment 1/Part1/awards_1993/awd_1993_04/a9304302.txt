Abstract    :
              9304302  Kappelman  PI and an international team of collaborators will study the
               paleontology (principally mammalian, including hominids),  paleoecology,
              paleoclimatology, stratigraphy and sedimentology,  magnetostratigraphy, and
              geochronology of the Miocene Sinap  Formation of central Turkey. This
              well-preserved, 6+-million-year-  long section provides a key to large-scale
              correlation in Europe.   The biogeographical position of the strata as a
              crossroads between  Europe, Asia and Africa will permit intercontinental
              correlations  and a calibrated sequence of Neogene mammalian evolution.    ***
