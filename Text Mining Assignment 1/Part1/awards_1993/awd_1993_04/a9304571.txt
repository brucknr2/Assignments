Abstract    :
              Djuth  9304571    A high speed radar processor for improved studies of the
              Earth's ionosphere and upper atmosphere.    Many emerging techniques for the
              operation of large radar facilities used for atmospheric research require high
              data throughput rates and computer processing speed.  As a result, much of the
              data is averaged in a way that adversely affects the spatial and temporal
              resolution of the measurements.  The computer system developed as part of this
              Phase II SBIR award will greatly increase the utility of a variety of existing
              radar systems through the use of a flexible, high-performance radar processor. 
              Preliminary tests at Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico indicate that major
              improvements i the resolution and accuracy of the radar observations can be
              achieved through the implementation of computationally intensive radar
              techniques.  The Massively Parallel Spectral Processor developed under this
              award can be directly applied to a wide range of  large to mid-sized radar
              systems used to probe the Earth's atmosphere.  It can also be adapted for
              imaging radar applications, incorporated into certain tactical radar systems,
              and converted into a processor for the nuclear sciences.  ***
