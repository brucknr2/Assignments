Abstract    :
                   The consumption of oceanic plates beneath continental                     
              plates at subduction zones is a fundamental component of                       
              seafloor spreading.  The subduction of active spreading                        
              ridges at these zones is thought to produce profound changes                   
              to the overriding plate in terms of magmatism, mineral                         
              deposits, structural deveopment, as well as sedimentation                      
              and development of the accretionary wedge that builds up at                    
              the edge of the subduction zone. This later phenomena is                       
              poorly understood but important because accretionary wedges                    
              contain some of the world's largest oil and gas deposits.                      
              This project will collect new field structural data and use                    
              theoretical analysis to construct 3-D models of the                            
              accretionary wedge.  These new data will provide the sort of                   
              database needed to test recent evolutionary models.
