Abstract    :
                This research is to do a broadband seismic experiment with 10-               
              15 portable REFTEK/STS-2 seismograph systems to image the                      
              continental shield region of SE Brazil.  Carnegie Institution, in              
              cooperation with the University of Sao Paulo and other Brazilian               
              institutions, will deploy the seismic array in SE Brazil for a                 
              period of 18 months.  The structure will be determined by means of             
              seismic wave travel times,wave-form inversion of boundary                      
              interaction phases, surface wave inversion and by shear-wave                   
              splitting techniques.  This shield area was formed and stabilized              
              in late Precambrian time during which a mosaic of heterogeneous                
              cratonic blocks and microplates of varying ages were amalgamated               
              to form the Gondwana supercontinent.  The purpose of this study is             
              to increase our understanding of the evolution of the crust and                
              upper mantle of this shield, especially questions related to the               
              thickness of the lithosphere.
