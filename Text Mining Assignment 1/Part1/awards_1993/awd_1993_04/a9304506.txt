Abstract    :
                                                                            9304506  Muhunthan
               During an earthquake, the motion of the ground inputs both  kinetic and
              potential energy into a soil mass or structure.  The ability of these systems
              to dissipate this energy when  subject to vibration is a key factor in the
              design of  earthquake-resistant systems.  Energy principle have  traditionally
              provided methods for the design of earthquake-  resistant structures, but for
              soil dynamics, the approach  has been to concentrate on stress-strain based
              formulations.  Thus, this project is motivated to examine the response of  soil
              structures to earthquake loading using energy  principles to quantify soil
              performance up to failure.    The objective of this research project is to
              identify and  develop the relationships between relevant energy 
              characteristics in monotonic and cyclic loading leading up  to failure and soil
              liquefaction, and to use the state  boundary surface as an energy envelope that
              provides a  unifying link between monotonic and cyclic loading.  As part  of
              this development, it is necessary to examine the question  of uniqueness of the
              state boundary surface.    The main objectives are:  1. Establish an energy
              envelope for monotonic soil behavior  and its relationship to the state
              boundary surface.  2. Investigate the hypothesis that liquefaction initiates 
              when the input energy level exceeds the dissipation energy  in cyclic loading. 
              3. Develop a framework to analyze soil failure due to  liquefaction, based on
              energy principles.    This is a collaborative research project involving 
              Washington State University and the Georgia Institute of  Technology.  ***
