Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Ralf Spatzier continues to investigate rigidity properties                
              of Riemannian manifolds and group actions.  In particular, he                  
              proposes to study hyperbolic actions of higher rank abelian                    
              groups, actions of semisimple groups, higher rank Riemannian                   
              manifolds, geodesic flows and manifolds of negative curvature.
