Abstract    :
              The proposed work will measure reaction rate constants, product                
              branching ratios and spectrcospic rate parameters which must be                
              further quantified in order to reliably model the sodium nightglow             
              and to unequivocally utilize simultaneous measurements of sodium               
              nightglow emissions and ground state sodium concentrations to                  
              quantify nighttime upper mesospheric ozone levels.  The low                    
              temperature NaO+O(3P) reaction, a secondary source of mesospheric              
              NaO, will also be investigated.                                                
              These experimental investigations will utilize temperature variable            
              fast flow kinetic technique and crossed molecular beam methods,                
              both coupled to high resolution tunable laser probes for                       
              spectroscopic state identification and characterization.  Their                
              successful completion will allow a much more experimentally                    
              grounded modeling effort to quantify the mesospheric Na nightglow              
              and more firmly anchor recent attempts to use measured nightglow               
              levels coupled with lidar measurements of atomic sodium density to             
              deduce nighttime concentrations of upper mesospheric O3.
