Abstract    :
              9304429  Riggs       This award provides approximately one-half the funding 
              required to equip a rock-crushing and mineral separation laboratory  to be
              housed in the Department of Geology at the Northern Arizona  University. The
              University is committed to providing the remaining  funds necessary for the
              equipment.       The Principal Investigator and colleagues at Northern Arizona 
              University are engaged in a number of research projects requiring  the
              separation of small amounts of dateable minerals (for example,  zircons for
              uranium-lead dating) from their rock matrix. The  facilities will also be used
              by scientists at the U.S. Geological  Survey located at Flagstaff.  ***
