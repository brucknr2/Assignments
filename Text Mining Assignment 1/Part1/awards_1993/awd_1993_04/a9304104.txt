Abstract    :
              9304104  Slingerland       This study will investigate the processes of
              avulsion, i.e.,  the permanent diversion of flow away from an existing river 
              channel, and the role of avulsion in the evolution of river  floodplains and
              alluvial sedimentary deposits.  The approach will  be collaborative, focusing
              on mathematical modelling experiments,  and modern and near-modern river
              floodplains.  The project will  attempt to address such questions as the causes
              of avulsion, the  processes by which avulsions initiate and propagate through
              flood  basins, the manner in which floodplains subsequently react to  avulsion,
              and the effects of avulsion on the character of  floodplain deposits.      
              Because avulsion is an inevitable consequence of floodplain  aggradation, it
              may play a vital, and heretofore underappreciated,  role int he evolution of
              alluvial sedimentary sequences because it  is likely to be a major process of
              deposition instead of merely a  mechanism by which old channels are abandoned
              and new ones formed.   When properly understood, avulsions may require
              modifications in  the way we view the origin and role of meander belts, the
              relative  importance of avulsive vs overbank flooding, and the manners in 
              which floodplain deposits are generated.  ***
