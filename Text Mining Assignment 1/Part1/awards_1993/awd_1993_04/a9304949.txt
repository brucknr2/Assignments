Abstract    :
              9304949  Beck                             This PASSCAL field project will
              examine the deep structure of the  South American Altiplano, one of the world's
              highest and largest  plateaus with an average elevation of nearly 4 km, a
              crustal  thickness of 65 km and area of over 600,000 square km at the 
              intersection of southern Peru, western Bolivia, and northern Chile.   The
              investigation will test theories of formation of this plateau  and of
              mountain-building in general.  The investigators will deploy  20 PASSCAL
              seismic stations across the region to determine  variations in crustal
              thickness, structure of the underlying mantle  wedge, and shear wave splitting
              which is an indication of the  fabric and distortion history of the rock.  A
              collaboration in  deployment and analysis is planned with the French ORSTOM
              Program  and with South American scientists.  This active seismic area,  where
              the oceanic plate is subducted under the continent, is an  analog to the U.S.
              Pacific Northwest tectonic regime.  This  research is a component of the
              National Earthquake Hazard Reduction  Program.  ***
