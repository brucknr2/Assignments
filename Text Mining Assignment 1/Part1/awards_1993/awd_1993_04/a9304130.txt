Abstract    :
              9304130  Busby       PI and co-workers will map and study an oceanic arc of 
              Cretaceous age in Baja California, Mexico.  They will build facies  models for
              oceanic arcs that evaluate the response of sedimentary  systems to explosive
              eruptions, to effusive eruption and shallow  level intrusion, and to sector
              collapse of volcanoes.  Based on  these studies, they will also evaluate means
              for distinguishing  subaqueous from subaerial eruptive deposits.  They will
              then relate  facies to and test models for phases of arc and basin formation.
