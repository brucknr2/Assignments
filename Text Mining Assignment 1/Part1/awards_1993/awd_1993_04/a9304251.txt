Abstract    :
              This renewal award, with participation by the Divisions of                     
              Chemistry, Materials Research, Physics and Biological                          
              Instrumentation and Resources made to the MIT Laser Research                   
              Facility will provide core support for thirteen Chemistry and                  
              Physics faculty. A number of new collaborative research                        
              projects will be started.  In physical chemistry, these include                
              development of modulated-spectroscopy techniques, with                         
              application to two dimensional optical spectroscopy and free                   
              radical detection; exploration of singlet and triplet molecular                
              potential surfaces at high levels of excitation; and collision                 
              processes involving vibrationally excited atmospheric species.                 
              Fundamental physics studies will include atom-cavity quantum                   
              electrodynamics and explorations of quantum chaos in Rydberg                   
              atoms.  In materials science, quantum crystallites,                            
              surface-functionalized quantum particles, and acoustic                         
              properties of polymer films will be investigated.  Studies of                  
              enzyme model systems, including methane monooxygenase and                      
              ribonucleotide reductase, and the mechanisms of light                          
              transduction in photosynthesis and visual pigments will be the                 
              focus of research in biological and inorganic chemistry.  All                  
              of these projects require the high resolution, multiple-laser,                 
              and/or ultrafast-pulse equipment provided by the facility.

              This facility also provides students with hands-on experience                  
              and training in advanced spectroscopic techniques. The                         
              interaction of the investigators leads to new collaborations                   
              and research programs which would not exist in the absence of
