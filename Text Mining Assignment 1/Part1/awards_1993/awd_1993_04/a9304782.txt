Abstract    :
              9304782  Okamura  Photosynthetic bacteria convert light energy into chemical
              energy  by photo-induced electron transfer reactions in a pigment protein 
              complex called the reaction center (RC).  The initial charge  separation within
              the RC is coupled to electron transfer across  the membrane by electron
              transfer from a mobile electron carrier,  cytochrome c2.  Important features of
              the reaction between the RC  and cytochrome c2 are the high rate of electron
              transfer and also  the molecular recognition of electron transfer partners. 
              The  structural basis for these two properties will be investigated by 
              studying the effects of mutating the following types of residues:  (1) Charged
              residues on the RC and cytochrome will be modified to  investigate
              electrostatic interactions between the two redox  partners.  Complementary
              charge changes on the RC (negative to  positive charged residues) and
              cytochrome  (negative to positive  charged residues) will be made to map out
              the specific ion  pairing interactions in the cytochrome RC complex.  (2)  
              Uncharged residues on the RC surface near the cytochrome binding  site will be
              mutated to residues having different molecular sizes  and hydrophobicity.  The
              pattern of changes in binding and  electron transfer observed will be used to
              map out the binding  interaction and possible pathways for electron transfer. 
              %%%  Biological systems derive much of their energy from electron  transfer
              between proteins in biological membranes.  Two major  questions of electron
              transfer that are currently not understood  are:  How do electron donor and
              acceptor proteins recognize and  bind to each other?  and what is the pathway
              for electron  transfer though proteins?   The answers to both of these 
              questions will be studied for the reaction between the bacterial  reaction
              center and cytochrome c2, from the photosynthetic  bacterium Rb. sphaeroides.
