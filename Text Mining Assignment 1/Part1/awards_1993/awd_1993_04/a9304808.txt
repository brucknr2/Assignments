Abstract    :
              9304808  Nelson         This award will support planning for the second phase of
              an  international collaborative project to collect deep seismic  reflection and
              related geophysical and geological data across the  Himalaya/Tibet Plateau
              collision zone.  The pilot phase of this  project, termed INDEPTH
              (INternational DEep Profiling of Tibet and  the Himalaya) was successfully
              completed last summer (1992) by a  team of U. S. and Chinese scientists
              operating a Chinese seismic  reflection crew in southern Tibet.  The cost of
              the pilot project  was shared by NSF's Continental Dynamics Program and China's
               Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources.  Having demonstrated  "proof of
              concept" with the pilot study, the principal  investigators will proceed with
              the next phase of INDEPTH data  acquisition during the summer of 1994.  In
              order to do this,  however, the need to:         1.   Bring their Science
              Advisory Team and other potential            U.S. and foreign participants in
              INDEPTH together to            review final analyses of the pilot survey
              results, to            identify the next profiling site to recommend to their  
                       Chinese colleagues, to design the core seismic            experiments
              and to coordinate the broader participation            by these other groups in
              INDEPTH.         2.   Send a delegation of INDEPTH scientists to China to      
                   negotiate the next phase of INDEPTH data acquisition,           
              participate in a workshop being  held by the Chinese to            discuss the
              joint results of the pilot study, and most            importantly scout the
              next profiling site in Tibet.         This award will support these critical
              planning activities.  ***
