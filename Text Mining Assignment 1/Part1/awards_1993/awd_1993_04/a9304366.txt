Abstract    :
              This action provides support for a conference on U.S.                          
              implementation of the recently signed Environmental Protocol to the            
              Antarctic Treaty.  Legislation is needed as part of the                        
              ratification process for the Protocol, and this meeting will be                
              oriented to exchanging information and perspectives on the key                 
              issues and options that must be considered as Congress works to                
              develop and pass the required legislation.  The meeting will                   
              involve participants from all the organizations interested in the              
              implementation process, including congressional staff,                         
              representatives of agencies with interests in the Antarctic, tour              
              operators, and environmental organizations.
