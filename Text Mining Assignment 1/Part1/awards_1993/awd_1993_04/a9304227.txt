Abstract    :
                   Arias will investigate several problems in Banach space                   
              theory with applications to operator theory and probability.  The              
              main areas of research will be the local theory of Banach spaces,              
              nest algebras for a Banach space perspective, and finite-                      
              dimensional operator theory.                                                   
                   Banach space theory is that part of mathematics that                      
              attempts to generalize to infinitely many dimensions the                       
              structure of 3-dimensional Euclidean (i.e.ordinary) space.  The                
              axioms for the distance function in a Banach space are more                    
              relaxed than those for Euclidean distance (For example, the                    
              "parallelogram law" is not required to hold.), and as a result,                
              the "geometry" of a Banach space can be quite exotic.  Much of                 
              the research in this area concerns studying the structure theory               
              of Banach spaces.
