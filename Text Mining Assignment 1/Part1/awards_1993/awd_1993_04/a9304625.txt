Abstract    :
              Funds are provided to support the 1993 Cyanobacterial Workshop                 
              being held at Asilomar, California.  The workshop is focussing on              
              the use of cyanobacteria to explore basic biological problems such             
              as photosynthesis, metabolic regulation, acclimation to diverse                
              environmental conditions, and gene expression.                                 
              %%%                                                                            
              Cyanobacteria provide an excellent model system for studying                   
              photosynthesis, response to nutrient stress, and the mechanisms of             
              cell development.  This meeting is presenting the latest advances              
              in uncovering how these important process occur.
