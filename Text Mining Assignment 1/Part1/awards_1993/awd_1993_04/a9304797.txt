Abstract    :
              9304797  Clement         Recent interpretations of paleomagnetic records of
              polarity  transitions have given rise to a great deal of controversy over 
              transitional VGPs which tend to fall along two preferred  longitudinal bands. 
              While some workers have interpreted the  geographical grouping of transitional
              VGPs as evidence that large  scale symmetries were present in the transitional
              fields, others  have suggested that the grouping, if significant,results from
              an  artefact of the recording process in sediments.  It is clear that 
              additional records are required to resolve this controversy, and  for this
              reason the PI undertook a project sampling six Pliocene  polarity transitions
              recorded in the Suva Marl in Fiji.  Renewal  of the original grant will support
              fine-scale, detailed sampling  of four identified transitions zones in the Suva
              Marl.  ***
