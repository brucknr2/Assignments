Abstract    :
              Professor Anatol M. Zhabotinsky is supported by a grant from                   
              the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to study                   
              spatial pattern formation in chemical reaction-diffusion                       
              systems (RDS).  A major goal of this research is to study new                  
              types of chemical wave patterns and ultimately to compile a                    
              comprehensive set of experimental examples of the basic types                  
              of wave patterns in chemical RDS which are supported by a                      
              kinetic analysis of the corresponding reaction mechanisms.  The                
              research has two immediate objectives: 1) a search for wave                    
              patterns emerging in uniform stable RDS via the wave                           
              (Turing-type 2) bifurcation; and 2) a study of chemical wave                   
              propagation and interaction resulting in new types of pattern                  
              formation in chemical RDS with parametric gradients or                         
              anisotropy.  The latter line of work originates from new wave                  
              patterns discovered by the Principal Investigator and                          
              collaborators in the Belousov-Zhabotinsky RDS with an oxygen                   
              concentration gradient.                                                        
              %%%                                                                            
              Spatial pattern formation in chemical reaction-diffusion                       
              systems (RDS) is an important problem in modern macroscopic                    
              chemical kinetics.  Chemical reaction-diffusion patterns                       
              constitute the most convenient analog models for pattern                       
              formation in neurobiology, morphogenesis, chemotaxis, and                      
              ecology.  A number of oscillating chemical reactions are                       
              important in the functioning of living organisms, and pattern                  
              formation is essential to such fundamental biological functions                
              as cardiac stimulation.  Zhabotinsky's research in this area                   
              will provide many important mechanistic insights into these                    
              processes.
