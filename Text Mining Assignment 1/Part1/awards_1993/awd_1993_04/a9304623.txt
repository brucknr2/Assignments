Abstract    :
              9304623  Hemley       This award provides one-half the funding required for the 
              acquisition of a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer system  (FTIR) that
              will be installed at the infrared beamline at the  National Synchrotron Light
              Source (NSLS), Brookhaven National  Laboratory. The Principal Investigator's
              institution, the Carnegie  Institution of Washington, is committed to providing
              the remaining  funds necessary for the acquisition of this system.       The
              FTIR system will be used in a wide variety of ultra-high  pressure studies done
              in diamond-anvil cells at the NSLS IR  beamline. The high brilliance and broad
              spectral distribution (from  the visible to the far infrared), and the
              pulsed-time structure of  the radiation will make possible a new class of
              spectroscopic  measurements on materials at the ultra-high pressures attainable
               in the diamond-anvil cell. Studies made possible by this system  will include
              infrared measurements of the electronic and  vibrational excitations associated
              with the metallization of  hydrogen above 150 GPa. Similar measurements will
              also be performed  on the other planetary gases and ices, including binary and
              more  complex mixtures. These investigations will provide key constraints  on
              models of the interiors of the large planets. Electronic  spectra, including
              band-gap closure phenomena, in iron-bearing  silicates and oxides will be
              studied over the entire pressure range  of the Earth's lower mantle (to 135
              GPa).  ***
