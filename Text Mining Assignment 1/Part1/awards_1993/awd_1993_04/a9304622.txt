Abstract    :
              9304622  Mao         Recent experimental advances in high-pressure technology
              have  provided the ability to simulate the P-T conditions of the entire  Earth
              in the laboratory.  This award is for continued support of  a systematic study
              of the equations of state and elasticity of  Earth materials with diamond-anvil
              cells.  The PIs will use  synchrotron x-ray diffraction techniques to determine
              lattice  parameters and molar volume, and to use Brillouin spectroscopy to 
              determine compressional and shear wave velocities, both at high P  and T.  With
              recently established experimental techniques, they  will systematically acquire
              a comprehensive and accurate database  representative of realistic Earth
              compositional models.  ***
