Abstract    :
              9304587  Molnar       This research is a continuation of a two-year study of the
               tectonics of the Tien Shan province of western China.  The research  plan is
              to map geology along a cross section through the fold and  thrust belt along
              the southern margin of the range and construct  balanced cross sections to
              estimate amounts of crustal shortening.   Nearly all of the data are now in
              hand to make the same estimates  across the northern margin of the range. 
              Measurement of fault  scarp heights that cut alluvial fans on the south side of
              the Tien  Shan and associated dating will allow estimates of shortening rates 
              across the edge of the range in Holocene time.  The style of  deformation seen
              in the surface geology will be related to the  evidence provided by earthquake
              seismology and geology.  Goals  include placing bounds on the total Cenozoic
              shortening and on the  late Quaternary rate of shortening, relating the styles
              of faulting  associated with earthquakes and with the fold and thrust belts,
              and  gaining an understanding of how intracontinental mountain building  occurs
              and develops.  This research is a component of the National  Earthquake Hazard
              Reduction Program.  ***
