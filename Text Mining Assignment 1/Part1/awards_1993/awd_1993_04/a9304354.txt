Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The transport of volatile organic compounds in unsaturated porous              
              media will be studied in the laboratory.  The emphasis will be on              
              processes that dominate transport over a broad areal extent.  These            
              include gas diffusion, gas advection, mass transfer between the                
              soil water and soil air phases, and sorption onto soil particles.              
              A bench scale apparatus will be constructed to study these                     
              processes individually.  In the unsaturated zone, gas phase                    
              transport-- both gas diffusion and gas advection--is a primary                 
              pathway by which volatile organic compounds migrate.  Five factors             
              that affect gas transport in the unsaturated zone will be studied              
              using the bench scale apparatus.  These are the soil moisture                  
              content, the gradient in atmospheric pressure, the concentration of            
              the diffusing gas, the temperature, and advective flow of water.               
              In addition to gas diffusion and advection, transport in the                   
              unsaturated zone is influenced by the dissolution of the vapor                 
              phase compound into the water phase.  This is true  both in                    
              equilibrium systems--when Henry's law governs the distribution of              
              the compound between the phases--and in nonequilibrium systems--for            
              instance, during infiltration (Cho and Jaffe, 1990; Cho, 1992).                
              The soil gas-soil water mass transfer rate coefficient will be                 
              quantified using the bench scale experimental apparatus over a                 
              range of moisture contents, advective fluid flow rates, atmospheric            
              pressures, and temperatures.  It has been observed that compounds              
              bound to the solid matrix of a porous medium can act as long-term              
              sources of contamination in groundwater aquifers (Cho, 1992; Smith             
              et al., 1990).  The sorptive and desorptive fluxes of such sorbed              
              contaminants into the fluid phases will be quantified, again using             
              the bench scale experimental cell. Finally, pilot scale experiments            
              will be conducted using a pilot apparatus used  in previous vadose             
              zone experiments (Cho, 1992).  In the pilot scale experiments, the             
              individual transport processes described above will be examined in             
              consort.
