Abstract    :
                   This research encompasses three separate lines of study: a)               
              Asymptotics beyond all orders; b) Kinetic theory and resonant                  
              triads, and c) Models for motion of curves and surfaces in space.              
              The results have potential for important applications in                       
              nonlinear dynamics and applications of the KAM theory.  The KAM                
              theorem asserts that under appropriate circumstances most of the               
              trajectories of the system remain regular at the onset of chaos;               
              only a few trajectories actually become irregular, or chaotic.                 
              So far there is no available theory that can identify which                    
              trajectories become chaotic under small perturbations.  If                     
              successful, the work proposed here will enable scientists to work              
              with dynamical systems containing both chaotic and regular                     
              trajectories.                                                                  
                   This issue is important in many fields, one of which is the               
              design of plasma fusion devices like tokomaks.
