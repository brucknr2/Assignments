Abstract    :
                   Professor Reeder will continue his work on the                            
              representations of p-adic algebraic groups. He will seek explicit              
              results about the representations containing an Iwahori-fixed                  
              vector. This work exploits the interplay between p-adic harmonic               
              analysis and complex algebraic geometry.                                       
                   This project falls into the general area of arithmetic                    
              geometry -a subject that blends two of the oldest areas of                     
              mathematics: number theory and geometry.  This combination has                 
              proved extraordinarily fruitful - having recently solved problems              
              that withstood generations.  Among its many consequences are new               
              error correcting codes.  Such codes are essential for both modern              
              computers (hard disks) and compact disks.
