Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The 1993 Southeast Regional Developmental Biology Conference will              
              be held at the University of Georgia on May 14-16, 1993.  The                  
              organizers of the meeting are Robert Ivarie and Lawrence J.                    
              Shimkets.  The conference is composed of six sessions:  1)                     
              Microbial Development;  2) Early Steps in Development;  3) Plant               
              Development;  4) Cell Determination and Pattern Formation;  5)                 
              Regulation of Gene Expression; and  6) Growth Factors and                      
              Development.  To add additional interest we have invited two                   
              nationally prominent developmental biologists to give keynote                  
              addresses, Dr. P. O'Farrell from the University of California, San             
              Francisco, and Dr. W. Timberlake from the University of Georgia.               
              In addition, all participants will have the opportunity to present             
              posters.  This meeting will provide an excellent opportunity for               
              scientists and their students from Alabama, Florida, Georgia,                  
              Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, North Carolina, South              
              Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia to meet and                   
              exchange ideas and information on developmental biology.  Based on             
              the attendance of recent meetings, 120-150 participants are                    
              expected.  Partial support is requested from NSF to help defray                
              room and board expenses for graduate students attending the                    
              conference.
