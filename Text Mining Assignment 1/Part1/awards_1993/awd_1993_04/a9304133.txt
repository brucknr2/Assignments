Abstract    :
              9304133  Ryan       This award provides one-half the funding required for the 
              acquisition of a direct current plasma emission spectrometer (DCP)  system to
              be installed and operated in the Department of Geology  at the University of
              South Florida in Tampa. The University is  committed to providing the remaining
              funds needed for the  acquisition.       The DCP will be an integral part of
              the research activities  of several faculty members and their students who
              require high  precision elemental chemical analyses of geological rock and
              water  samples. Their current investigations include geochemical studies  of
              volcanic and metamorphic rocks from subduction zones, fluid-  rock interactions
              during diagenesis of sediments, paleoclimate  reconstructions from biotic
              carbonates, and the geological record  of sea-level changes.  ***
