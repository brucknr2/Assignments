Abstract    :
                   The Department of Statistics at the University of Wisconsin-              
              Madison will purchase computing equipment which will be dedicated              
              to support research in the mathematical sciences.  This equipment              
              will be used for several research projects, including in                       
              particular:  assessment of estimation techniques for nonlinear                 
              mixed effects models, tree-structured statistical methods, and                 
              statistical model building.
