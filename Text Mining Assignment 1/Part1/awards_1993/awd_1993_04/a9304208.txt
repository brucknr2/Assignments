Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This Americas Program award will support Richard                               
              Patterson of Indiana University in collaboration                               
              with Marco Paluszny of the Universidad Central de                              
              Venezuela.  The researchers intend to collaborate                              
              on the development of algorithms to use                                        
              implicitly defined cubic curves in computer-aided                              
              geometric design.                                                              
                                                                                             
              There are essentially two ways to describe curves                              
              in the plane: with a parametrization or an                                     
              implicit equation. The parametrizations used in                                
              computer-aided design are defined either by                                    
              polynomials or by rational functions and they                                  
              offer several advantages, including ease of                                    
              graphing and the existence of various methods to                               
              control them.  However, there is much to be                                    
              gained by the use of implicit equations in                                     
              computer-aided geometric modeling, including the                               
              localization of points with reference to the                                   
              curve.  Moreover, the use of implicit curves is                                
              in its infancy in comparison with parametric                                   
              curves and, consequently, much work remains to be                              
              done on the subject.  The collaborators bring to                               
              the topic complementary approaches and expertise,                              
              and the work has the potential to make an                                      
              important contribution, particularly in the area                               
              of numerical/computational modeling.
