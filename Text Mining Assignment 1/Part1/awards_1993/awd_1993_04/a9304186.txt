Abstract    :
              9304186  CONSTABLE, Catherine       Recent global geomagnetic field models
              provide detailed  pictures of the geomagnetic field, both at Earth's surface
              and at  the core-mantle boundary.  However, because of the short time  spanned
              by the historical data that contribute to these models,  they only sample a
              tiny fraction of the variability known to occur  in the geomagnetic field. 
              This project is to extend the time  period over which global field models are
              available using time  series of paleomagnetic data derived from archeological
              artifacts  and sediment.  A limited number of high quality data sets exist 
              spanning the past 3000 years, and these will be compiled and  carefully
              assessed.
