Abstract    :
                   This proposal deals with the study of Galois representations              
              associated to elliptic curves and modular curves.  Several years of            
              study have yielded a large number of classes of these                          
              representations and an appreciation for their properties.  The PI              
              proposes to link representations in these classes.  If carried out             
              successfully, this will provide an alternative to the Serre-Mazur-             
              Ribet program that gets around the Shimura-Taniyama-Weil                       
              conjecture.                                                                    
                   This is research in the field of number theory.   Number                  
              theory starts with the whole numbers and questions such as                     
              the divisibility of one whole number by another.  It is among the              
              oldest fields of mathematics and it was originally pursued for                 
              purely aesthetic reasons.  However, within the last half century,              
              it has become an essential tool in developing new algorithms for               
              computer science and new error correcting codes for electronics.
