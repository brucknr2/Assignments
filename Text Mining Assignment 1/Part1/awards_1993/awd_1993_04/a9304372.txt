Abstract    :
              This ongoing project will continue development and                             
              application of new techniques for the microanalysis of                         
              stable isotope ratios.  The studies will utilize the laser                     
              probe, ion microprobe and conventional techniques to study                     
              micron-scale zoning in high grade metamorphic rocks.  The                      
              principal goals of the project are to document the styles of                   
              isotopic zonation in metamorphic rocks and to elucidate the                    
              causes of such heterogeneity.  This research will ultimately                   
              find application in evaluating theories of fluid migration                     
              in the crust, granulite genesis, geothermometry, and                           
              cooling/uplift history.
