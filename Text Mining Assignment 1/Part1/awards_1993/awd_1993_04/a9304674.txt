Abstract    :
                9304674  Carter  This is a project to adapt X-ray crystallographic phasing
              methods  based on the theoretical work of G. Bricogne and apply them to 
              protein structure determination.  The immediate goal is to complete  the
              structure of the monoclinic form of tryptophane synthetase  using maximum
              entropy extrapolation and phase permutation to  generate new phases and
              symmetrization by a known six-fold  noncrystallographic redundancy to refine
              them.  The expectation is  that noncrystallographic symmetry averaging,
              together with  techniques cited above represent sufficient potential phase 
              information to solve the structure ab initio.  %%%  This proposal deals with
              advanced computational methods for solving  crystal structures using maximum
              entropy methods.  In particular,  these studies involve the crystallographic
              phasing problem,  especially involving deficient data sets and may lead to 
              eliminating the need for isomorphous replacement methods.  These  methods will
              be applied to solve the structure of monoclinic  tryptophanyl-t-RNA synthetase.
