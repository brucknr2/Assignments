Abstract    :
                   Radin will study mathematical problems relating the causes                
              of crystalline symmetry in low temperature matter and                          
              classification of the dynamical systems associated with uniquely               
              ergodic tilings of Euclidean space.  The methods to be used are a              
              combination of traditional ergodic theory and new techniques from              
              aperiodic tilings.  It is expected that the recent results on                  
              rotation symmetric tilings will open significant new research in               
              the study of material structure and in the classification of                   
              dynamical systems.                                                             
                   This project involves research in ergodic theory.  Ergodic                
              theory in general concerns understanding the average behavior of               
              systems whose dynamics is too complicated or chaotic to be                     
              followed in microscopic detail.  Under the heading "dynamics                   
              can be placed the modern theory of how groups of abstract                      
              transformations act on smooth spaces.  In this way ergodic theory              
              makes contact with geometry in its quest to classify flows on                  
              homogeneous spaces.
