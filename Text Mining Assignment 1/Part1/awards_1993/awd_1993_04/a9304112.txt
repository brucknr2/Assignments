Abstract    :
              9304112  Reid       This award provides partial funding to support a technician 
              for the thermal ionization mass spectrometry (TIMS) laboratory in  the
              Department of Earth and Space Sciences at the University of  California, Los
              Angeles. The Principal Investigator and faculty  colleagues provide scientific
              direction for the UCLA TIMS  laboratory that consists of three mass
              spectrometers and ancillary  instrumentation. The laboratory provides isotopic
              analyses of  rubidium, strontium, samarium, neodymium, lead, and thorium for a 
              wide variety of geochemical research projects using these isotopes  either as
              tracers or for dating geological events. A technician is  needed to assist with
              the operation and maintenance of the  laboratory.  ***
