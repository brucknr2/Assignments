Abstract    :
              9304513     Fastovsky       PIs will conduct a statistical data analysis of
              fossil  material collected by the Milwaukee Public Museum "Dig a Dinosaur" 
              program.  Proposed analyses will test the hypothesis that dinosaurs  dwindled
              gradually in diversity and abundance during the last 2.2  million years of the
              Cretaceous.  This research will also address  the general problem of
              determining rate of extinction, including  taphonomic issues, sampling and
              preservation biases, and  (paleo)ecologic controls.
