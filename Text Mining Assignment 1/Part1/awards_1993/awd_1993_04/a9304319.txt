Abstract    :
              Dr. Spangler proposes to study the molecular basis for recognition             
              of receptor ligands by bacterial toxins, characterizing the amino              
              acid residues and structural conformation of the toxin's receptor-             
              binding site and modeling the receptor-toxin interaction with                  
              conformationally restrained peptides.  This goal will be                       
              accomplished in part by a combination of computer-assisted                     
              molecular modeling and experimental binding studies of specific                
              peptide fragments recently shown to inhibit pertussis toxin binding            
              to receptor analogs.  To initiate this study and facilitate the                
              molecular dynamics portion of the project, three-dimensional                   
              structural information for these peptides will be required, coupled            
              with an experimental determination of the binding characteristics              
              of the peptides.  The proposed preliminary study will consist of:              
                   (a) peptide structure prediction by computational methods                 
                   (b) peptide structure solution by NMR methods                             
                   (c) computer modeling of peptide interaction with receptor                
                       analogs                                                               
                   (d) experimental verification of the ability of the peptides              
                       to bind receptor analogs and to block the binding of the              
                       intact toxin                                                          
              %%%                                                                            
              The long range goal is to explore protein-ligand interactions and              
              provide a rational basis for understanding and manipulating                    
              molecular                                                                      
              recognition in both binding functions and protein folding.  The                
              techniques and information developed are of value in prediction of             
              receptor structures to aid design of drugs, herbicides or                      
              pesticides; antigens in vaccine design; or novel molecules, such as            
              catalytic antibodies and new molecular electronic devices based on             
              proteins, that can be developed by protein engineering to provide              
              a template for catalysis or electron transfer.
