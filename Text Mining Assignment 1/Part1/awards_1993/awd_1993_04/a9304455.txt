Abstract    :
              The proposed work involves three parts aimed at the study of                   
              crust-mantle evolution from 4.3 Ga to present, all of which                    
              use Hafnium isotope variations as the common theme.  The                       
              projects we have chosen reflect a balance between                              
              identification of key localities and sample suites and areas                   
              of research in which the PI and Co-PI have extensive                           
              experience.  Our investigations of the sub-continental                         
              mantle focus on sites which represent major, rapidly-                          
              developed thermal anomalies in the mantle that involved                        
              various contributions from plume, depleted mantle, and                         
              lithospheric mantle.  Work on the earliest differentiation                     
              of the Earth concentrates on integrated Nd, Hf, and U/Pb                       
              isotope work on the oldest terrestrial materials:  4.3 to                      
              4.0 Ga zircons from western Australia and the 4.0 Ga Acasta

              recycling focus on the Penokean Orogen in Wisconsin through                    
              whole-rock/mineral Nd and Pb and combined Nd, Hf, and U/Pb                     
              isotope analysis of inherited, Proterozoic, and Archean                        
              zircons.  This work represents a collaborative effort with                     
              11 other researchers at seven institutions.
