Abstract    :
                   Professor Blasius will continue his work on Shimura                       
              varieties and their associated motives. He will study motives                  
              attached to Hilbert modular forms using the stable trace formula               
              and endoscopy.  He will also study reductions mod p of these                   
              varieties.                                                                     
                   This project falls into the general area of arithmetic                    
              geometry -a subject that blends two of the oldest areas of                     
              mathematics: number theory and geometry.  This combination has                 
              proved extraordinarily fruitful - having recently solved problems              
              that withstood generations.  Among its many consequences are new               
              error correcting codes.  Such codes are essential for both modern              
              computers (hard disks) and compact disks.
