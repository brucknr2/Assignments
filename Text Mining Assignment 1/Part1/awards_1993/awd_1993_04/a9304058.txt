Abstract    :
                   During emplacement of large masses of magma, country                      
              rock material  is transferred out of the path of the                           
              ascending/inflating magma body, but precisely how this is                      
              accomplished is a long-standing problem.  This project will                    
              approach the question by examining selected examples in                        
              which pluton roofs (as opposed to the more commonly                            
              preserved walls) are available for study, in the hopes they                    
              preserve evidence for the space-accommodating mechanism that                   
              is not evident in pluton walls.  The work will involve                         
              detailed mapping, strain analysis, fabric study and other                      
              microstructural techniques to constrain three-dimensional                      
              structural reconstructions of emplacement-related                              
              deformation.  The Yerington batholith, Nevada, the Mount                       
              Powell batholith, Montana and other examples will be                           
              studied.  Results will address how material was transferred                    
              during emplacement and will help refine the relationship                       
              between emplacement of plutons and magma chamber evolution.
