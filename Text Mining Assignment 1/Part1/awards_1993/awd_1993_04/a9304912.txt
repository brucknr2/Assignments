Abstract    :
              9304912  Lagally    The proposed effort aims to combine scanning tunneling
              microscopy  (STM) with diffraction techniques to investigate diffusion, 
              interactions with steps, initial film formation, and a number of  other aspects
              of the kinetics and thermodynamics of film formation.   Measurements are
              planned both in real time and in a quench-and-look  mode.  Epitaxial,
              Stranski-Krastanov, and Volmer-Weber systems will  be investigated.  From a
              combination of theoretical and  experimental effort, quantitative values of
              energies, barriers, and  rates will be extracted.  Systems include Si, Ge, and
              a number of  metals on SI(001) substrates.  Stress effects will be investigated
               using also Si whiskers as substrates.  Because in STM measurements  the
              electric field from the tip may influence rates of kinetic  mechanisms, a
              comprehensive investigation of this phenomenon will  be undertaken.  %%%  In
              this research diffraction methods and scanning tunneling  microscopy are used
              to investigate atomic scale mechanisms involved  in film growth.  These
              mechansisms all have some sort of  morphological or microstructural
              consequence.  An analysis of the  changing morphology can be interpreted in
              terms of the responsible  mechanisms.  There are in principle two ways of doing
              this: 1)  real-time measurements or 2) quench-and-look measurements.  In the 
              former, one attempts to follow the changing positions of atoms or  the shape
              and size of particular structures.  The latter is  effectively a series of
              snapshots of the morphologies that are  frozen in at different times.  The
              proposed work is important  because crystal growth is at the basis of all
              thin-film technology.  ***
