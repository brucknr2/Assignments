Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              In the marine confining units (Tertiary) of the Atlantic Coastal               
              Plain, analysis of the mechanically-extracted pore waters from                 
              cores indicate elevated concentrations of sulfate (maximum value,              
              2200 mg/L).  This project proposes to determine (a) the source of              
              the elevated sulfate concentrations, and (b) the impact the sulfate            
              concentrations have on water quality in the confined aquifers.  The            
              principal investigator and 3 independently-funded collaborators                
              propose to evaluate sulfate transformations and pathways in deep               
              confining beds.  Sediments from deep marine (unweathered) confining            
              units will be retrieved as core samples in cooperation with a                  
              Continental Dynamics Program drilling project during March through             
              the Fall of 1993.  Twenty core samples from one confining unit will            
              be analyzed over the following 18 months.   Major analyses include             
              the determination of pore-water chemistry, mineralogy, sulfur and              
              strontium isotopes in solid and aqueous phases, and microbiology.              
              These results will be used to constrain a coupled flow and                     
              transport model to assess the relative impact that various                     
              processes have on sulfate transport through marine confining units.            
              This proposal reviews the nature and implications of the elevated              
              sulfate concentration issue, describes the rationale for the chosen            
              analytic activity, and outlines the field procedures and logistics.            
              Successful analysis will provide important understanding of sulfate            
              hydrogeochemistry and valuable insight into confining unit effects             
              on aquifer water quality.
