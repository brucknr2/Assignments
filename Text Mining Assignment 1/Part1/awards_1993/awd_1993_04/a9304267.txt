Abstract    :
              This is a proposal to perform a thorough study on lava flows                   
              from two important intra-plate volcanic chains:  Samoa and                     
              Guadalupe.  Those localities were selected because they have                   
              extraordinary Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic compositions, suggesting                       
              they retain an unusually recognizable record of the                            
              processes responsible for mantle heterogeneity.  Limited                       
              analyses demonstrate that these two localities are equally                     
              distinctive wit respect to helium:  Samoa and Guadalupe                        
              have, respectively the highest and the lowest 3He/3He ratios                   
              found in mantle derived rocks.  Excellent samples from both                    
              Samoa and Guadalupe have been obtained specifically for this                   
              work.  In collaboration with several other investigators,                      
              the most important of these will be thoroughly studied.                        
              This includes petrographic and petrologic characterization,                    
              measurements of Sr, Nd, Pb, and He isotopes, and a limited                     
              number of Ar age determinations.  The proposed work is new                     
              because it involves a very complete study of He systematics                    
              on well-controlled samples.
