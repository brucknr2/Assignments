Abstract    :
                   This award supports research in the area of finite group                  
              theory.  The principal investigator will study "fixed point"                   
              problems, including cases where the operator group is not                      
              solvable.  He will look into the character theory of finite                    
              groups with many normal subgroups, using character factorization               
              techniques among others, to reduce questions about arbitrary                   
              finite groups to questions about finite (almost) simple groups.                
              He will also look into the theory of the finite almost simple                  
              groups, extending and refining his results on the maximum length               
              of chains of subgroups and Schur index formulas, among others.                 
                   A group is an algebraic structure with a single operation.                
              It appears in many areas of mathematics, as well as, physics and               
              chemistry.  The fundamental building blocks of finite groups are               
              finite simple groups.  One of the major results in mathematics of              
              the past decade is the classification of the finite simple                     
              groups,  the proof of which would require 10,000 to 15,000                     
              journal pages.  This research goes beyond the classification                   
              theorem to provide further information about finite groups.
