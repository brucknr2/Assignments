Abstract    :
              9304999  Biel  The ultimate objective of this research is to elucidate the 
              mechanism by which oxygen regulates tetrapyrrole biosynthesis in  Rhodobacter
              capsulatus.  Recent evidence has suggested that the  condensation of two
              aminolevulinate molecules to form the first  pyrrolic intermediate,
              porphobilinogen, is regulated by oxygen.   This step is catalyzed by the enzyme
              prophobilinogen synthase, the  product of the hemB gene.  The research
              described in this proposal  seeks to determine whether oxygen regulates
              transcription of the  hemB gene, which encodes porphobilinogen synthase, or the
              activity  of this enzyme, or both.  Transcriptional regulation of the hemB 
              gene will be investigated by measuring hemB mRNA production and  degradation in
              cultures grown under high and low oxygen.  Oxygen-  mediated regulation of
              porphobilinogen synthase activity will be  measured by following the kinetics
              of protoporphyrin formation  during a shift-up in oxygen tension.  If oxygen
              regulates  porphobilinogen synthase activity, protoporphyrin accumulation 
              should stop immediately upon oxygenation of the culture.   Antibodies against
              porphobilinogen synthase will be used to  determine if oxygen causes increased
              degradation of the enzyme.  %%%  In the photosynthetic bacterium Rhodobacter
              capsulatus, a single  branched pathway is used to make heme and
              bacteriochlorophyll.   Oxygen greatly reduced the expression of this pathway. 
              The step at  which oxygen regulates this pathway has been located, and the 
              research described in this proposal seeks to determine whether  oxygen
              regulates the synthesis of the enzyme porphobilinogen  synthase, the activity
              of the enzyme, or both.  ***
