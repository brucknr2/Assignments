Abstract    :
                   In orogenic zones affected by multiple deformation                        
              events, it is common for structural features such as faults                    
              to be reactivated, although documenting multiple movements,                    
              of the same or different displacement styles has proven to                     
              be difficult.  This project will address this classic                          
              problem by looking at spatial variations in facies and                         
              thickness of syn-deformational sedimentary units in                            
              proximity to faults of the Bisbee Group (Early Cretaceous)                     
              in two key areas where the section appears to be anomalously                   
              thick.  These rocks subsequently were deformed by Late                         
              Cretaceous to Paleogene age were deformed by Late Cretaceous                   
              to Paleogene age (Laramide) compression.  If the Laramide                      
              structure was previously a major normal fault in early                         
              Cretaceous time, characteristics of the Lower Cretaceous                       
              strata (paleocurrents, thickness variations etc) should                        
              record proximity to the fault.  Results have the potential                     
              to unambiguously separate the effects of the two tectonic                      
              events superimposed on this area, and by extension may                         
              provide sedimentologic and structural criteria to resolve                      
              multiple fault reactivations elsewhere.
