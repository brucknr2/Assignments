Abstract    :
              The Wrangell volcanic field (WVF) defines the northeastern-                    
              most expression of late Cenozoic volcanic activity                             
              associated wit plate convergence in southern Alaska.  The                      
              primary goals of this research are:  identification and                        
              characterization of  mantle and crustal reservoirs                             
              responsible for WVF volcanism;  quantification of the                          
              relative roles of these reservoirs in the evolution of WVF                     
              mafic silicic products; and evaluation of the relationships                    
              between magmatic evolution, mantle-crust interactions, and                     
              lithospheric structure and composition in the WVF as a model                   
              for understanding continental arc processes.  In order to                      
              achieve these goals, combined field, petrographic, mineral                     
              chemistry, elemental (including REE), and isotopic (Sr, Nd,                    
              Pb) studies of eruptive products from three major WVF                          
              volcanic centers, Mount Drum, Mount Churchill, and Skookum                     
              Creek, are planned.
