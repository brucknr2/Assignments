Abstract    :
              9304580  Langlands       The School of Mathematics of the Institute for Advanced
               Study (IAS) was formed in 1930 at the founding of the IAS.  The  initial goal
              of the School was to provide a haven for scholars  where scholars could work in
              an environment that was  exceptionally favorable for conducting research.  Over
              the years,  other roles have emerged and the School has tried to accomplish 
              two complementary purposes, to foster mathematical research and  to educate
              mathematicians who are at various levels of maturity  beyond the doctorate. 
              Although it has functioned in a clearly  international context, the main impact
              of the Institute has been  on the U.S. mathematical community, with a majority
              of its  visitors having come from or been absorbed by it.  The Institute 
              frequently conducts programs in special areas of mathematics.   Recent topics
              have included the theory of turbulence in fluid  dynamics, computational number
              theory, and differential geometry.       This project will support postdoctoral
              and other visiting  researchers at the School of Mathematics of the Institute
              for  Advanced Study with the goal of supporting a wide spectrum of 
              mathematical research at the highest level.  The primary  component of the
              project will support postdoctoral researchers  and the remainder will support
              mid-career mathematicians whose  presence at the Institute provides
              postdoctoral Members unique  opportunities for consultation and collaboration.
