Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The subsurface flow regime within wetlands is well understood only             
              in very few locations, despite the large areal importance of peaty,            
              water-saturated terrain on Earth's surface and the hydrologically              
              strategic location of wetlands in many catchments.  Ecologists have            
              long attributed key aspects of peatland development to the                     
              interactions of hydrology, chemical transport, and plant growth.               
              Wetlands can also play a critical, controlling role in the                     
              transport and fate of toxic chemicals.  The present project is                 
              focused on such a wetland, where a deep peat deposit interacts with            
              both a heavily contaminated river and a glacial outwash aquifer                
              containing a former municipal wellfield.  In this setting the                  
              fundamental processes of subsurface water transport through a                  
              peatland will be studied, with a focus on peat characteristics at              
              several spatial scales and the processes that subsurface water flow            
              and chemical transport.  One working hypothesis is that, due to                
              heterogeneity on the scale of the peat formation, rates of both                
              water and pollutant movement through the wetland may significantly             
              exceed the low rates commonly attributed to peat formations.                   
              Accordingly, a variety of measurements and tests will be conducted             
              to define and assess the importance of these heterogeneities.                  
              Investigative techniques will include head and hydraulic                       
              conductivity measurements, a piezocone survey, aquifer                         
              stress/tracer tests, chemical analyses of soil and groundwater, and            
              speciation analysis and sequential extractions of certain toxic                
              metals.
