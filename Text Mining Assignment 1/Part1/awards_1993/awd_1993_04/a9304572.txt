Abstract    :
                   The use of an intense artificial X-ray source for geophysical             
              and well logging procedures to determine strata formation density,             
              lithology, and composition is desirable over 1-2 Ci level sources              
              of l37 Cs or 60 Co.  An accelerator based photon source reduces the            
              radiological handling risk and the considerable expense of down                
              hole loss.  In Phase I, North Star Research successfully                       
              demonstrated operation of a innovative 200 kV, 400  A (beam                    
              current) Nested High Voltage (NHV) accelerator and the production              
              of radiation.  Notable characteristics of this device were the                 
              small diametric size (10 cm), mass (13.6 kG), and the capability               
              for higher voltage operation (constrained only by the Phase I drive            
              power limitations).  North Star proposes to incorporate                        
              enhancements in accelerator internal design, drive power                       
              optimization, and electron beam control into a package that                    
              produces at a minimum 0.663 keV, 100  A beam suitable for intense              
              radiation production and nuclear logging.  The embodiment of the               
              proposed NHV resulting from a funded Phase II effort would                     
              immediately compete with other logging systems employing l37 Cs.
