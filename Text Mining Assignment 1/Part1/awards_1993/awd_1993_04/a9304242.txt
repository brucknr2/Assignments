Abstract    :
                   The Department of Engineering Sciences and Applied                        
              Mathematics and the Department o Electrical Engineering and                    
              Computer Science of Northwestern University propose to purchase a              
              Silicon Graphics IRIS Crimson/VGXT graphics workstation together               
              with peripheral equipment to allow for hard copy and video                     
              output.  The equipment will be used to provide graphical analysis              
              and animations for the following research projects:                            
                   .  Visualization of the complex spatial and temporal                      
                      patterns that occur in combustion.                                     
                   .  Visualization of the development of                                    
                      microstructures in solidification.                                     
                   .  Visualization of complex spatial patterns an                           
                      temporal dynamics governed by Ginzburg-Landau,                         
                      Kuramoto-Sivashinsky and other generic amplitude                       
                      equations.                                                             
                   .  Visualization of both the spatial structure and                        
                      the evolution of shear bands in viscoplasticity.
