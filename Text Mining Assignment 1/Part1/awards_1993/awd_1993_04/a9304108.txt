              Description:  This project will support the                                    
              participation of a U.S. scientific delegation                                  
              in a symposium to be held in Bangalore, India,                                 
              August 8-13, 1993.  The symposium "Pollination                                 
              Biology in the Tropics" would review recent                                    
              advances and bring together scientists working                                 
              on various aspects of pollination.  specific                                   
              attention is to be paid to conservation and                                    
              management of pollinator populations and to                                    
              problems in the pollination of tropical crops.                                 
              The following sessions will be held: flower                                    
              biology in reaction to pollination; insect                                     
              behavior in relation to pollination;                                           
              pollination by insects and other animals in                                    
              natural communities; insect pollination in                                     
              commercial production of seeds and fruits;                                     
              pollination problems in tropical crops;                                        
              conservation and management of pollinating                                     
              insects; and population dynamics of                                            
              pollinators.  Participation is expected from                                   
              countries in South Asia, Southeast Asia,                                       
              Europe, and the U.S.  A book covering extended                                 
              abstracts of the presentation will be available                                
              in the meeting.

              scientific objectives including disseminating                                  
              and increasing availability of pollination                                     
              especially in the tropical environment,                                        
              increasing interaction of scientists from the                                  
              U.S. with those from other countries in Asia,                                  
              and exposing young U.S. scientists to                                          
              researchers in India in the same field of                                      
              interest.
