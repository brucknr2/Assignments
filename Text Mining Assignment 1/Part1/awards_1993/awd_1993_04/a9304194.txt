Abstract    :
                This research is to improve surface-wave dispersion maps using               
              both dispersion and polarization data measured from long-period                
              (greater than 100 seconds) 3-component recordings from the various             
              global networks.  Surface wave dispersion maps provide important               
              constraints on global models of shear-wave velocity structure.  The            
              current generation of surface-wave dispersion maps show significant            
              differences from author to author and the additional constraint of             
              polarization data, interpretated within a ray-theoretical                      
              framework, provides sensitivity to higher-order structure.  In                 
              order to validate the procedures and assess the importance of                  
              large-scale anisotropy, the work will include application of the               
              measurement and interpretation techniques to coupled-mode synthetic            
              seismograms.
