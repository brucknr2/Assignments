Abstract    :
              9304173  Handel  This proposal seeks funding for the "XII. International
              Conference on Noise in Physical Systems ad 1/f Noise," organized at the
              University of Missouri in the Clarion/Regal Riverfront Inn Building, St. Louis,
              MO, on August 16-20, 1993.  This conference will bring together reseachers of
              all countries from universities, industrial and governmental research
              laboratories, industrial enterprises, as well as graduate students, all working
              in the field of Noise in Physical Systems, mainly electronic noise in
              high-technology applications, and in the fields of chaotic and random
              fluctuations in general.  ***
