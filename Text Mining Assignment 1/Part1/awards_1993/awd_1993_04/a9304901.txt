Abstract    :
                   An international symposium on the Geochemistry of the Earth               
              Surface will be held at University Park, Pennsylvania on August 1-             
              6, 1993.  The symposium is the third meeting of the Working Group              
              on Geochemistry of Weathering and Diagenesis of Sediments, (GWDS-3)            
              which is affiliated with the International Association of                      
              Geochemistry and Cosmochemistry. Past meetings have been held in               
              Granada, Spain (1986) and Aix-en-Provence, France (1990).                      
                   The scientific sessions will cover a wide range of topics in              
              surficial geochemistry:  paleoclimates and paleosols, chemical                 
              weathering and denudation at scales from the watershed to global,              
              early diagenesis and organic geochemistry of sediments, geochemical            
              kinetics at low temperatures, global cycles, and environmental                 
              geochemistry.  A prominent theme of the symposium will be the role             
              of surficial geochemical studies (of both modern and                           
              paleoenvironments) in the international global change effort.                  
                   Past meetings have been truly international, and we will                  
              continue the tradition.  In addition, the GWDS-3 encourages the                
              participation of students, and of scientists from developing                   
              nations.  To achieve these goals we are requesting support                     
              (primarily for travel and meeting expenses of students and foreign             
              participants) from the National Science Foundation.  We will defray            
              part of the costs of the distinguished foreign invitees, as well as            
              to establish a NSF-sponsored, travel assistance award for students             
              and foreign participants.
