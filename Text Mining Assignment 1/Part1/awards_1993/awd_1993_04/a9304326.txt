Abstract    :
                   One of the most provocative tectonic models advanced in                   
              recent years contends                                                          
              that the eastern edge of the North American continent                          
              collided with the southern                                                     
              South America (Argentina) during the Grenville orogeny in                      
              Late Precambrian-early                                                         
              Paleozoic time (750-550 Ma).  This idea has major                              
              implications for the evolution                                                 
              of the earth in terms of tectonics, climate, and organic                       
              distribution.  This                                                            
              proposal outlines plans to test this model by  examining                       
              critical shear zones in                                                        
              Argentina that are thought to have facilitated this major                      
              collision.   The                                                               
              project will initially concentrate on gathering kinematic                      
              data on shear zones in

              conditions during movement.
