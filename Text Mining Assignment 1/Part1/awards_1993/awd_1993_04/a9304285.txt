Abstract    :
                   The investigator proposes research in submanifold geometry.               
              Particular questions are those concerning isoparametric                        
              submanifolds in space forms and generalizations to symmetric                   
              spaces or a Hilbert space.  Also intended is a study of                        
              symplectic torus actions on infinite dimensional symplectic                    
              manifolds.
