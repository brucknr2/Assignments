Abstract    :
              This continuing research project will examine the solution                     
              characteristics of highly charged cations in peralkaline,                      
              metaluminous and peraluminous SiO2-rich melts.  Phase                          
              equilibria, kinetic, and spectroscopic techniques will be                      
              applied to the study of Nb, Ta, Ti and Sn in the                               
              haplogranite system K2O-Na2O-Al2O3-SiO2-H2O.  High-                            
              temperature micro-Raman spectroscopy will be used for the                      
              study of melt microstructure. The objectives of the research                   
              are to establish a hierarchy of interactions of these highly                   
              charged cations with network-forming, network-modifying, and                   
              other highly charged cations and to examine the phase                          
              equilibria of highly evolved magmas such as high silica                        
              rhyolites and pegmatites.
