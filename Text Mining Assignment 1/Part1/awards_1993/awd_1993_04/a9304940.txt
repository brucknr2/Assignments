Abstract    :
                9304940  Eisenstein  The goal of this research is the elucidation of a
              molecular  mechanism of control for the allosteric enzyme threonine deaminase 
              from E. coli, with particular emphasis on the regulation of enzyme  activity by
              the small heterotropic effectors isoleucine and valine.   Our approach consists
              of characterizing the effects of regulatory  ligands on both substrate binding
              and catalysis, and then combining  the information with experimental
              measurements of heterotropic  effector-promoted global, and local,
              conformational changes to  ultimately provide a molecular explanation of
              control by feedback  inhibition.  %%%  The activities of enzymes involved at
              junctures between metabolic  pathways are often controlled by substrate and
              product  concentrations as well as by products of other pathways.  This 
              proposal is significant in that it involves extensive work on the 
              characteristic enzyme-associated mechanistic specificity of an  allosterically
              controlled system, a pyridoxal phosphate-dependent  enzyme, threonine
              deaminase.  These studies involve sophisticated  kinetic and structural studies
              which in their synthesis will yield  a model relating enzyme structure and
              binding to alterations in  kinetic behavior.  This would be a great
              achievement.  ***
