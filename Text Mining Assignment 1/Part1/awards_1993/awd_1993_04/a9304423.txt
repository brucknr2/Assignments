Abstract    :
                   This award is concerned with the theory of noncommutative                 
              Noetherian rings, particularly with that of connected graded                   
              algebras satisfying the Artin-Schelter (AS) regularity condition.              
              The AS regular rings have been a subject of considerable research              
              recently, since they provide genuinely new, geometric techniques               
              for the study of noncommutative rings and are related to other                 
              areas of current interest, notably quantum groups.  The principal              
              investigator will study specific, important examples of these                  
              algebras to develop the abstract theory of AS regular algebras                 
              and the related theory of "noncommutative projective geometry".                
              The principal investigator will also work on extending existing                
              results on connected graded, Noetherian PI rings of finite global              
              dimension.                                                                     
                   This research is in the general area of ring theory.  A ring              
              is an algebraic object having both an addition and a                           
              multiplication defined on it.  Although the additive operation                 
              satisfies the commutative law, the multiplicative operation is                 
              not required to do so.  An example of a ring for which                         
              multiplication is not commutative is the collection of nxn                     
              matrices over the integers.  The study of noncommutative rings                 
              has become an important part of algebra because of its increasing              
              significance to other branches of mathematics and physics.
