Abstract    :

              Research Center in Yucatan.  The researchers                                   
              intend to study the isoprenoid biosynthetic                                    
              pathway and its regulation.                                                    
                                                                                             
              Isoprenoids are ubiquitous in nature, essential                                
              for life, and mediate a number of interactions                                 
              between organisms and their environment.  In                                   
              addition, plants are a rich source for                                         
              pharmaceutically important isoprenoids.  Recent                                
              results suggest that compartmentation of the                                   
              biosynthetic machinery plays an important role in                              
              regulating what type of isoprenoids are actually                               
              made.  Through novel experiments the researchers                               
              intend to test the hypothesis that discrete                                    
              metabolic units are dedicated to specific                                      
              metabolic products.  Results from these studies                                
              will help to elucidate the mechanisms regulating                               
              isoprenoid metabolism in plants, and will have                                 
              important ramifications for future manipulations                               
              of this pathway using genetic engineering                                      
              technology.
