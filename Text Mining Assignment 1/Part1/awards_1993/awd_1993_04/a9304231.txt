Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Dendrochronologists at the Laboratory of Tree-Ring Research,                   
              University of Arizona, have established a continuous bristlecone               
              pine tree-ring chronology from one locality in eastern California              
              that reaches from the present back to 6700 B.C.  Wood from the                 
              trees has been used to calibrate the radiocarbon time scale in                 
              calendrical years back to 6450 B.C.   An attempt will be made to               
              connect discontinuous segments of the tree-ring chronology that now            
              reach back to about 9500 B.C., or, through the entire Holocene into            
              Late Glacial times.  Samples dating earlier than 6450 B.C. will be             
              used for further radiocarbon calibration at the NSF-University of              
              Arizona Accelerator Mass Spectrometer facility.  This is of                    
              considerable scientific interest because this data set is the only             
              one that might now, and for some time, provide truly annual                    
              resolution for independent verification of a similar radiocarbon               
              calibration based on European oak and pine.  The temporal overlap              
              between the oak and pine is not however based on tree-ring cross-              
              dating, but on matching patterns of radiocarbon activity near 8750             
              B.P.  Several bristlecone pine series now in hand are 14C dated to             
              the early Holocene.  One appears to have high potential for                    
              verifying the pattern of radiocarbon activity relied upon in the               
              European work.  This interdisciplinary work is important because it            
              permits new levels of accuracy in measurement of the rates of                  
              change in many global environmental processes.  The wood itself,               
              through other kinds of analyses, can provide new information on                
              the nature and range of variation in climatic and other                        
              environmental parameters.
