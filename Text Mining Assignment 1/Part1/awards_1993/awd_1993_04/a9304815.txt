Abstract    :
              9304815  Grossman       PIs will conduct a stable isotope study to investigate
              the  paleoceaonographic, paleoclimatic and geochemical changes  associated with
              Carboniferous glaciation and the formation of  Pangaea.  They will continue to
              develop isotope stratigraphy for  the Carboniferous to P-Tr boundary based on
              brachiopods, sampling  more locations in North America, as well as in Russia. 
              A  Carboniferous geographic divergence will be further studied, with 
              consideration of diagenesis, calibration of species effects, and  evaluation of
              preservation of original shell chemistry.  The cause  of this
              excursion/divergence will be investigated; oxygen isotope  data will be used to
              test for glaciation and climate change on the  North American and Russian
              platforms.    ***
