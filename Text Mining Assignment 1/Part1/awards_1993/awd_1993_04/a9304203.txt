Abstract    :
                  930403  Steindler    The cerebral cortex provides the neural substrate for 
              thinking, perception, and memory.  It is divided into a mosaic  of regions with
              different cellular composition and  connections.  Each region is specified to
              process a particular  type of information.  Some regions process information
              from  sensory receptors, others process information coming from  brain centers
              that program responses.  How this differentiated  mosaic develops from an
              undifferentiated equipotential  embryonic matrix is a subject on intense
              interest and  controversy.  This NSF Small Grant for Exploratory Research  will
              enable Dr. Steindler to explore the role of an  extracellular matrix molecule
              called tenascin in the formation  of cortical boundaries.  Tenascin is secreted
              by neuroglia,  the non-neuronal support cells of the nervous system.  It is 
              found at the boundaries of cortical regions early in  development but
              disappears by maturity.  Dr. Steindler  hypothesizes that this molecule forms a
              barrier between  adjacent regions and prevents mixing of fiber afferents.  He 
              will use newly developed antibodies to tenascin to study the  role of this
              molecule in the formation of regional boundaries  in the "whisker-barrel
              field," an area of cortex with  regionally distinct boundaries that are easily
              discerned.   Since tenascin has a widespread distribution in the animal 
              kingdom, this work should provide insight into general  mechanisms of pattern
              formation during development.  More  specifically the results will have
              implications for theories  of cortical development and cortical regeneration
              after injury  in the adult.   ***
