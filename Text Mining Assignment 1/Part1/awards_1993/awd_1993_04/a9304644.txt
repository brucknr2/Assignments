Abstract    :
                   Urban planning has come under attack recently for failing to              
              improve urban society.  Although many facets of American cities                
              now appear to be in worse condition than they were 30 or 40 years              
              ago when urban planning was actively embraced by most                          
              municipalities, it is not certain what impacts planning had on                 
              the shaping of urban society, which planning techniques worked                 
              and which failed, and the extent to which mistakes from the past               
              are being repeated today.  This doctoral dissertation project                  
              will systematically evaluate records from and contemporary                     
              patterns in dozens of American cities, many of which formulated                
              Section 701 comprehensive plans from the late 1950s through the                
              1970s.  Focusing on the distribution of parks and recreational                 
              facilities, this project will use accessibility measures to                    
              compare the planned locations of these facilities with the actual              
              geographic distributions that subsequently emerged.  Through                   
              analyses of these measures, the degree to which comprehensive                  
              plans helped ensure more equitable distributions of park and                   
              recreation facilities in cities will be assessed.                              
                   This project will provide solid empirical analyses of the                 
              influence of comprehensive planning on the locational                          
              distribution of urban services for a diverse range of cities.  In              
              addition to evaluating the success of comprehensive planning in                
              meeting one of its goals, this project will provide valuable                   
              insights into the factors that contributed to the success and                  
              failure of planning efforts, and it will help assess the degree                
              to which planners have learned from their past experiences.  As a              
              doctoral dissertation improvement award, this award also will                  
              provide support to enable a promising student to establish a                   
              strong independent research career.
