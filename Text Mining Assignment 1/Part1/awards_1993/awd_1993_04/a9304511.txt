Abstract    :
              The Rice Hydrothermal system is an ideal location to                           
              evaluate the relative contributions of magmatic and 18O-                       
              shifted meteoric reservoirs to a hydrothermal fluid.  Three                    
              plume fluid models (no mixing, progressive upward dilution,                    
              and a spike of magmatic fluid) will be tested by measuring                     
              fluid parameters                                                               
              (    D,     18O, temperature, and salinity) which vary with                    
              the degree of mixing between two "end-member" fluids.  The                     
              plume hypothesis itself will be tested by studying the                         
              effects of water/rock interaction in sedimentary rocks in                      
              the Rico dome.
