Abstract    :
                   Recent studies have indicated that plate-tectonic                         
              processes were active at least as far back as the early                        
              Proterozoic.  Work has focused on orogenic compressional                       
              features, and a fold and thrust belt, for example, has been                    
              delineated in the Penokean orogeny in central Minnesota.                       
              However, little work has been done on post-orogenic aspects                    
              of these old systems, and the demonstration of large-scale                     
              extension during late-stage processes that helps return                        
              rocks to the surface in young orogenies prompts the                            
              examination of this possibility in the Penokean Orogeny.                       
              This project will employ structural analysis and extensive                     
              age dating to attempt to constrain the timing of cooling and                   
              to use these data to determine if simple erosion is                            
              sufficient or if  tectonic denudation was also involved.                       
              Results will help understanding of the late-stage processes                    
              in the Penokean Orogeny and provide additional insight into                    
              early proterozoic plate tectonics.
