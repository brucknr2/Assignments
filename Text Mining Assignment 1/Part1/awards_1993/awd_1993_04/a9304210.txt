Abstract    :
                   An interdisciplinary project on sustainable forestry in                   
              tropical dry forests in Quintana Roo (QR), Mexico will be                      
              conducted.  The project will help to implement and evaluate the                
              Plan Piloto Forestal.  Data on tree growth and regeneration will               
              improve a computer-based model that has been developed to plan tree            
              cutting rotations.  The impacts of sustainable forestry on the                 
              local avifauna, an important component of biodiversitiy, will also             
              be evaluated.                                                                  
              The project has four primary objectives:  (1)  quantify species-               
              specific growth rates of commercially important tree species, with             
              an emphasis on the influence of soil type and between-year                     
              differences in rainfall,  (2) quantify natural regeneration of                 
              commercially important species with an emphasis on seed production             
              and seedling establishment, survival, and growth, (3) evaluate the             
              use of a silvicultural treatment "refinement"  to enhance the                  
              growth of commercially important species by removal of their                   
              neighbors, and (4) evaluate the effects of selective logging on the            
              abundance and species composition of the local avifauna.
