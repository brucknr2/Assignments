Abstract    :
                   This action provides funds for Research Planning Grant                    
              to study pseudotachylyte formed in an extensional tectonic                     
              regime.  Pseudotachylyte is more commonly studied in                           
              compressional, transpressional or strike-slip regimes, and                     
              this study will characterize features of  pseudotachylyte                      
              from the extensional Southern Mountains of Arizona.  Results                   
              will be applied as a foundation for later, more detailed                       
              studies.
