Abstract    :
                   This project will require substantially enhanced efforts                  
              of international coordination on part of all STEP (Solar-                      
              Terrestrial Energy Program) participants.  To assure the                       
              continuity of operations, the Bureau of the Scientific                         
              Committee on Solar Terrestrial Physics re-appointed the                        
              Principal Investigator for another term of his functions as                    
              the International STEP Coordinator.  His participation                         
              during the coming years will be of benefit to the STEP                         
              scientists in the United States, because through his office,                   
              a close link to the international STEP activities and                          
              information will be assured.
