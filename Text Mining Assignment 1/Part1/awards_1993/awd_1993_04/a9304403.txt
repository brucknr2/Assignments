Abstract    :
                   This work involves five problems on the mathematical theory               
              of motion of continua:  1. Motion of an incompressible fluid with              
              free boundary and surface tension.  The PI plans to show that the              
              initial value problem is well-posed.  2. Existence for all time                
              of solutions to the equations of motion of an incompressible Neo-              
              Hookean material in two space dimensions.  3. Existence for all                
              time of solutions of the equations of motion of an incompressible              
              material in three space if the initial data are small.  4.                     
              Existence for all time of solutions to the equations of gas                    
              dynamics with small initial data in three space.  5. Existence                 
              for all time of solutions to the equations of motion of a perfect              
              fluid in three-space.                                                          
                   This study will broaden our understanding of the mechanisms               
              of motion of liquids, gases, and deformable solids and                         
              complication that may occur such as formation of shocks and                    
              singularities.  The dynamical study of the continua forms to                   
              theoretical basis for many areas of mechanical engineering and                 
              aerodynamics.
