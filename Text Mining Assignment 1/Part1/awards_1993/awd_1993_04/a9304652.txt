Abstract    :
                This research involves a search for lithosphere and mantle                   
              downwelling beneath the Hindu Kush, Burma Arc, and southern Tibet              
              by means of a residual sphere approach and 3-D finite difference               
              calculation for theoretical travel times.  Data will be collected              
              from WWSSN, Canadian network and digital (IRIS/GSN, GEOSCOPE and               
              GDSN) network data for earthquakes extending from the Hindu Kush               
              eastward to Burma.  Determination of differential residual spheres             
              for pairs of events on the order of 400 km apart should test for               
              the existence of a major downwelling proposed in the region by                 
              other scientists.  For each group of differential spheres,                     
              indications of deep high velocity anomalies will be forward modeled            
              using the finite difference scheme.  The methods and results                   
              developed will have application to seismically active areas of                 
              proposed downwelling in the U.S.  This research is a component of              
              the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
