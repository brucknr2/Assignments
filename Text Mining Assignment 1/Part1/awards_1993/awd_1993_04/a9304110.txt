Abstract    :
              9304110  Helmberger    This research is to compute motions from large
              earthquakes at  sites underlain by three-dimensional earth features, especially
               where a deep soft-material basin underlies buildings and other  structures. 
              Results from recent studies of the 1985 Mexico Cit  earthquake, the 1989 Loma
              Prieta earthquake and the 1992 Landers  earthquake in southern California will
              be used to compute the  response of the Los Angeles basin to great earthquakes.
               The work  is motivated by the fact that these earthquakes produced 
              surprisingly large motions at considerable distances, especially  at soft-rock
              sites.  These motions were significantly larger than  those predicted by
              standard engineering practice.  This research  is a component of the National
              Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.  ***
