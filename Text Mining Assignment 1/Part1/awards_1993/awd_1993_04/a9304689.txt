Abstract    :
              9304689  Banner       This award provides one-half the funding required for the 
              upgrade of a thermal ionization mass spectrometer in the Department  of
              Geological Sciences at the University of Texas-Austin. The  institution is
              committed to providing the remaining funds needed  for the equipment upgrade.  
                  Accurate and precise measurement of small ion beam currents  for mass
              spectrometry is critical for the research applications of  the PI and
              colleagues in the Department of Geological Sciences.  The upgrade consists of
              installing an ion counting device in the  detector system. Ion counting, as
              opposed to the existing analog  secondary electron multiplier measurement of
              ion current, will  improve the group's capabilities to analyze for
              low-concentration  trace element metals and isotopes in groundwater, fluid
              inclusions  in rocks, and to date small single crystals of zircon using the 
              uranium-lead isotopic system.  ***
