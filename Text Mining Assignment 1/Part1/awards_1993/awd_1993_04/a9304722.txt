Abstract    :
                The research is partitioned into four parts:  (1) cryptography;  (2)
              derandomization; (3) approximation algorithms; and   (4) parallel and 
              distributed algorithms.  As described below,   there are  strong
              interconnections and themes  that link the work in the different parts.  The
              interaction between  randomness and efficient computation is crucial in all 
              parts.  In cryptography,  randomness is crucial for hiding  information, and
              the interaction between  randomness and  computational power is the motivating 
              force behind the  definition of a pseudo-random generator.  The derandomization
              part explores the  development of general  methods for converting efficient
              randomized algorithms  into  efficient deterministic algorithms, and thus the
              interplay  between  randomness and efficiency is central.  The de-randomization
              part has strong  connections with the parallel  algorithms and approximation
              algorithms parts:  some of the  algorithms de-randomized are randomized
              parallel  algorithms,  and some are randomized approximation  algorithms.  Some
              of the work in  the approximation  algorithms part develops efficient
              randomized  approximation algorithms.    The work on the approximation
              algorithms is  done  jointly with the ESPRIT RAND working group.
