Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The goal of this research is to predict hydrologic and                         
              hydrochemical response of alpine catchments to perturbations in the            
              patterns of precipitation, precipitation chemistry, energy fluxes.             
              The objectives involve both improving our ability to model the                 
              processes, and examining the responses of test basins to possible              
              anthropogenic perturbations.  The main study areas are three                   
              headwater basins of the Tokapah valley on the Marble fork of the               
              Kaweah river in Sequoia National Park, which lie on the west slope             
              of the Sierra Nevada; and two headwater basins in the Rock Creek               
              drainage of the Eastern Sierra Nevada.  Several years of                       
              hydrological and hydrochemical data are available for these                    
              catchments.  The approach uses physically based mathematical                   
              modeling of the data records from these basins.  The algorithms                
              used for the modeling are being developed and tested as part                   
              NASA/EOS and other projects to provide an integrated approach to               
              modeling the hydrology and hydrochemistry of seasonally snow-                  
              covered alpine basins.  This project uses those tools to describe              
              and predict: i)spatially distributed snowmelt (discharge and                   
              chemistry), ii) snowmelt runoff, iii) stream, lake and soil                    
              chemistry, and iv) changes in snowmelt, runoff, and chemistry in               
              response to anthropogenic perturbations.  Issues of scale and                  
              parameter estimation are addressed.
