Abstract    :
                   Much of the western edge of North America is accreted,                    
              consisting of crustal fragments that collided with the                         
              mainland during subduction over the past 300 Ma.  The                          
              Insular Belt of British Columbia and Alaska is one the                         
              largest pieces to have been accreted.  This project is                         
              focused on establishing the timing and nature of "docking"                     
              of this terrane with North America.  Acquisition of data on                    
              the timing and geometry of such collisions is important for                    
              understanding the overall tectonic evolution of the region.                    
              Because collisions tend to disrupt local and often global                      
              patterns of subduction, this new information may have whole                    
              earth significance in terms of understanding the causes of                     
              changes in plate motions.
