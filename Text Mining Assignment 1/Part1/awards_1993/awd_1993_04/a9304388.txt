Abstract    :
              9304388  Sammis         The PI will develop a micromechanical model for the
              friction  of granular layers which incorporates comminution and rate and 
              state-friction between the particles.  This modeling will be guided  by
              numerical simulations using a modified state-of-the-art soil  mechanics
              program, and by recent laboratory studies on the effects  of layer thickness
              and particle size distribution, adding  complimentary experiments on the effect
              of normal stress.  This  work is motivated by seismological evidence relating
              fault zone  width to fault stability, by recent advances in using seismic 
              tomography and trapped modes to investigate the internal structure  of fault
              zones, and by recent evidence for slow precursors to  earthquakes on mature
              transform faults on the ocean floor which  imply a significant scaling change
              of friction parameters between  the laboratory and the field.  ***
