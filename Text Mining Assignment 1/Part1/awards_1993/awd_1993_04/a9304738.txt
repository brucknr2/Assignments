Abstract    :
              PI will study the stratigraphy and depositional history of several             
              Mississippian-age formations in southern New Mexico, along an                  
              ancient carbonate ramp to basin, during a period of paleoclimate               
              transition of "greenhouse" to "icehouse."  Excellent exposures and             
              biostratigraphic control will allow detailed sequence stratigraphy,            
              and elucidation of depositional processes and of controls on slope             
              and platform morphology.  Interregional comparison will allow the              
              test of sequence stratigraphic concepts and of models for carbonate            
              platform/slope evolution.
