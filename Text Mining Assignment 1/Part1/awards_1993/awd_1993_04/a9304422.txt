Abstract    :
                   Utility of marginal marine foraminifera as criteria for                   
              sequence boundaries will be tested, in three intervals in the                  
              Campanian Blackhawk and Sego formations.  Samples will be collected            
              from known marginal marine facies, a known sequence boundary                   
              related to an incised valley event, and a suspected sequence                   
              boundary.  Foram assemblages will be analyzed by faunal abundance,             
              planktonic/ benthonic ratios, agglutinated/calcareous ratios, and              
              species diversity.  Areal extent of marginal marine deposits along             
              a suspected sequence boundary will help predict likelihood of                  
              encountering such an interval in a core or outcrop.
