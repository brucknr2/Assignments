Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program                 
              will assist the Department of Chemistry at the University of                   
              Wisconsin, Madison, in the purchase of a high-resolution mass                  
              spectrometer.  Research projects which will benefit from the                   
              new instrument include:

                    Carriers and as Templates for Ion Channels;                              
                 2. Mechanistic Organometallic Chemistry;

              The research projects listed above represent only a small                      
              sample of the total number of research projects which will                     
              benefit from the purchase of the new instrument.  Such an                      
              instrument is essential to front-line research in synthetic                    
              chemistry, since it provides a means of rapidly identifying                    
              known compounds among reaction products and of providing                       
              structural information about new compounds.
