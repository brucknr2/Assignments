Abstract    :
              9304279  Griess       This award supports research aimed at developing a theory 
              which will unite all the sporadic simple groups by means of  infinite
              dimensional groups.  Specifically, the principal  investigator will
              investigator the general structure of infinite  dimensional groups associated
              to lattices.  He will study finite  structures associated to Lie groups and
              develop a general theory  of automorphism groups of a class of nilpotence class
              2 groups.   He will further classify finite subgroups of finite dimensional 
              simple Lie groups by data such as labeled Coxeter-Dynkin  diagrams.  The
              principal investigator will also work on a new  version of a moonshine module. 
                   A group is an algebraic structure with a single operation.   It appears in
              many areas of mathematics, as well as, physics and  chemistry.  The fundamental
              building blocks of finite groups are  finite simple groups.  One of the major
              results in mathematics of  the past decade is the classification of the finite
              simple  groups, the proof of which would require 10,000 to 15,000 journal 
              pages.  This research is aimed at using this classification in  the study of
              arbitrary finite groups.  ***
