Abstract    :
                      9304849  Cox    Polysphondylium pallidum forms distinctive spatial
              patterns during  its life cycle. One of these patterns, the radial arrangement
              of  spore bearing arms, arises from a spheroidal mass of cells at the  base of
              the developing organism. The emergence of the radial  pattern form a spheroidal
              one is a true symmetry breaking event  which Dr. Cox studies by examining the
              structure and function of  the genes involved. The genes coding for patterning
              elements are  isolated by a gene trapping method and used to study the timing
              and  regulation of their transcripts during development. The long range  goal
              of this research is an understanding of morphogenesis in a  simple system with
              a view to relating the various contributions  made by cell-cell interactions,
              the roles played by diffusible  chemical signals and their receptors, and the
              contributions of  intercellular adhesion and cell movement.  ***
