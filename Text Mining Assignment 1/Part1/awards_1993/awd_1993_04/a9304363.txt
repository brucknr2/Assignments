Abstract    :
              9304363  Banerjee       This award provides funding for three years for the
              operation  and maintenance of the Institute for Rock Magnetism in the 
              Department of Geology and Geophysics at the University of  Minnesota. The
              Institute was established in 1990 with funds from  NSF, the W.M. Keck
              Foundation, and the University of Minnesota. The  Institute provides access to
              state-of-the-art instrumentation for  scientists engaged in research aimed at
              understanding the  mechanisms by which rocks become magnetized to reflect the
              ambient  geomagnetic field. During the last three years of its existence IRM 
              facilities such as its high-field (5 T), low-temperature (4 K)  SQUID
              susceptometer and its magneto-optic Kerr effect (MOKE)  magnetic domain imager
              have been used by visitors in solving  questions about the composition,
              concentration, and grain-size of  the magnetic carriers. The Institute's policy
              of open access at no  cost to qualifying scientists will be continued during
              the tenure  of this award.  ***
