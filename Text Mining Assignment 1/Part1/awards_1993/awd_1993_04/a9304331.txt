Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Research is proposed to improve our understanding of atmosphere-               
              land surface relationships at local and regional scales.  The                  
              project will involve analysis of the atmospheric boundary layer to             
              study turbulent space-scale relationships.  Parameterizations of               
              the Atmospheric Boundary Layer (ABL) transport are critical for                
              quantifying surface fluxes over heterogeneous regions since the ABL            
              integrates regional scale fluxes.  The experimental data necessary             
              to carry out the analysis have already been collected: 1) Field (1             
              km length scale) experiments near UC Davis, 2) Basin (15 km length             
              scale) experiments in Ojai Valley southern California, 3) Regional             
              (100 km length scale) experiments in the Landes Regional in                    
              southwestern France as part of HAPEX-MOBILHY.  The data collected              
              over the different regions will be analyzed using compactly                    
              supported orthonormal wavelet expansions to study spatial                      
              intermittency of the surface heat fluxes for various wave numbers              
              in the inertial subrange.  In addition dual spectra, which enable              
              a space-scale representation of the turbulent energy, shall be                 
              applied to sensible and latent heat fluxes for different                       
              atmospheric stability conditions.  The spatial probability                     
              distribution of the heat fluxes at various scales will be also                 
              analyzed.  Ultimately this project will provide basic information              
              for the development of models of the ABL to parameterize surface               
              fluxes in general circulation models.
