Abstract    :
                   A workshop will be held to evaluate the role of food web                  
              research as an integrative paradigm in community and ecosystems                
              ecology. The meeting will follow a symposium/workshop format: 32               
              scientists will present papers with an anticipated 5-10 additional             
              people attending. Invited participants are from the United States,             
              Canada, and Europe, and include people working on theoretical and              
              empirical aspects of food webs. The primary objectives of the                  
              workshop include: (1) to define the state of the art in food web               
              research, (2) to explore commonalities in food web research using              
              a variety of approaches and at different levels of organization and            
              complexity, (3) to improve the integration of food web theory with             
              other bodies of theory in community ecology, (4) to critically                 
              evaluate existing methodology in empirical food web research, and              
              (5) to review the limitations and potential of food web approaches             
              for resource management and agriculture. Workshop participants will            
              make special efforts (1) to identify major areas of deficiency in              
              the current body of food web theory and in empirical methodology,              
              (2) to construct guidelines to address such deficiencies, and (3)              
              to stimulate greater collaborative research. An edited                         
              multiple-authored book will be published by Chapman and Hall                   
              Publishers.                                                                    
              %%%                                                                            
              This conference is an important and timely forum for discussion and            
              dissemination of information on empirical and theoretical food web             
              research. Additional funds have been received from other sources               
              making this a cost-effective workshop.
