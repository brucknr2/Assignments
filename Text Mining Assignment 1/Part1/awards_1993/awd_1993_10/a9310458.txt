Abstract    :
              9310458  Fisher  This two year project will develop, implement and evaluate an 
              ethics education curriculum in introductory psychology.  The  curriculum will
              provide the students with knowledge and skills  which can help them identify
              ethical issues in human subjects  research, consider moral ambiguities which
              arise within various  experimental contexts and generate resolutions sensitive
              to  alternative ethical approaches to specific research designs.   Classwork
              wiill expose students to cases illustrating research  methodologies of
              increasing ethical complexity, in major areas of  scientific inquiry in the
              field of psychology.  The case studies  will provide students with experience
              in evaluating the  applicability of scientific norms and the Ethical Principles
              of the  American Psychological Association to a broad range of research 
              problems.  During the first year of funding, instructional  materials and
              evaluation techniques will be developed and piloted,  followed by a 2-day
              summer faculty workshop.  During the second  year, the ethics education
              curriculum will be incorporated into  introductory psychology courses at
              Fordham and Loyola Universities.   Evaluation of the project will focus on
              faculty and student  satisfaction with the clarity, difficulty level, and
              relevance of  the curriculum as well as knowledge and skills in ethical
              reasoning  gained by students.  ***
