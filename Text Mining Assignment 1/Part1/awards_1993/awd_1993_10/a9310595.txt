Abstract    :
              9310595 Bott          Meiofauna (animals between 50 and 100 microns in size)
              feeding studies will be conducted in situ by following the accumulation in
              animals of flouorescently labeled bacteria and algae added to flumes inserted
              in the streambed.  Simultaneous measures of bacterial and algal productivity
              using  3H thymidine and oxygen change procedures, respectively will allow
              assessment of the proportion of production consumed by meiofauna.  Other
              grazing experiments will indicate whether protozoa are important intermediates
              in the transfer of energy from bacteria and algae to meiofauna and the extent
              to which meiofauna consume protozoa.  Finally, we will manipulate meiofauna
              densities and concentrations of dissolved organic matter to see whether those
              predators or nutrients, or both acting interactively or addictively regulate
              bacterial and algal densities and productivity. %%% Meiofauna are a
              conspicuously understudied group of organisms in streams, and the research here
              investigates their impact on epibenthic bacteria and algae, as well as the
              relative importance of nutrients and bacterivory in controlling bacterial
              biomass in streams.
