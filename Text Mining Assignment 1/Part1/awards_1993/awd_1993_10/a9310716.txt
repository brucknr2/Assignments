Abstract    :
              9310716  Mader  This study will systematically document and analyze experiences 
              in past California earthquakes to determine the nature and  sequence of
              building demolition decisions, the factors that  influence demolition
              decisions, and how they affect the safety,  speed, and effectiveness of
              recovery and historic resources.  Demolition planning, resulting in guidelines
              to help local  governments make decisions after earthquakes consistent with 
              overall community planning objectives.  Currently, little  knowledge exists on
              the role of demolition in recovery or the  long-term impacts of decisions to
              demolish earthquake damaged  buildings.  ***
