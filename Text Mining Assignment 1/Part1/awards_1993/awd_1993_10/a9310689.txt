Abstract    :
              9310689  MORRISON      In collaborative effort scientists at the University of
              Miami and  North Carolina State University will collect, process, and 
              disseminate satellite sensor data for the U.S. JGOFS Arabian Sea  Process Study
              (ASPS). To support cruise activities in near-real  time, large data sets from
              satellite flyovers will be processed and  transmitted to land-based planning
              sites will be done via Internet.   The scientific team will also maintain an
              archive of both  unprocessed satellite data and processed data products (such
              as  daily and weekly chlorophyll concentrations, sea surface  temperature,
              reflectance, etc.) for post-cruise analysis. The  specific end products from
              the data processing and the  methodologies for retrieving data will be
              determined in  consultation with other ASPS investigators.
