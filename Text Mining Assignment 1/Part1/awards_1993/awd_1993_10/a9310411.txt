Abstract    :
              9310411  FERGUSON  This project investigates the impact on the psychology of
              social  and legal identity caused by changing legal classifications of race 
              and gender in South Africa.  In South Africa, race and gender have  been
              understood to constitute "naturally" different social and  legal subject
              positions.  Recent and pending re-definitions of  legal status, by race and
              gender, have destabilized these subject  positions and will have important
              psychological implications for  the restructuring of political identity.  The
              investigator will  focus on women's collective action as the context in which
              to  examine how women articulate their sense of identity in social and  legal
              practice.  At this vantage point, the investigator will  observe and document
              the ways in which categories of racial and  gender difference create attitudes
              and behaviors, and structure  social interactions.  The research will make an
              important  theoretical contribution to the scientific understanding of legal 
              and political psychology.    The project will employ both long term
              ethnographic fieldwork and  archival research of relevant court records. 
              Research will be  conducted in Durban, Natal (and to a limited extent in
              Ulundi,  KwaZulu), with two community organizations.  The investigator will 
              document the ways in which women represent themselves to each  other, and, as
              collectivities, how they represent themselves and  their interests to the state
              (via court hearings), political  organizations, and other agencies.  ***
