Abstract    :
              9310603  Saville    Under the aegis of this equipment grant proposal, funds are 
              sought to purchase a set of devices (a high frequency impedance  analyzer,
              computer, and auxiliary equipment - hereafter to be  called the High Frequency
              Dielectric Spectrometer) to  characterize colloidal dispersions, emulsions and
              thin films via  measurements of the (complex) impedance of dielectric constant.
                The instrument will be used in several research projects  including:  (i)
              Dielectric Spectroscopy of Colloidal Dispersions  - Research on the electrical
              nature of the particle-fluid  interface and the properties of adsorbed polymer
              layers using  electrokinetic measurements, (ii) Microemulsions - Research on 
              the relationships between structures and bulk properties. (iii)  Dielectric
              Properties of Thin Film and Emulsions -  Characterization of thinning processes
              in single films and  emulsions.  ***
