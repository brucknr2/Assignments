Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT--CTS-9310542  The PI has requested the necessary equipment to assemble
              a laser based system that will be used for particle imaging velocimetry (PIV)
              and planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF).  This system should be capable of
              obtaining fundamental information on flame-vortex interactions leading to
              effects on flame strain, burn-rate, and extinction which are important factors
              in determining cycle-to-cycle variations in IC and fast-burn engines.  The
              proposed system includes a pulsed Nd:YAG laser, dye laser, and associated
              accessories and would enable measurements of flow velocities, and OH and O-atom
              densities to be made.  The equipment will greatly enhance the current
              Michigan/GM combustion program that is funded by NSF for which no laser
              diagnostics were budgeted.
