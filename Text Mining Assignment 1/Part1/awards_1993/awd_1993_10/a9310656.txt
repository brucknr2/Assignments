Abstract    :
              9310656  Kimball  A study of the dynamics of valence and structural behavior in 
              ferroelectric materials and their analogues will be explored by a  combination
              of Mossbauer spectroscopy and synchrotron radiation.  The efficacy of combining
              high resolution X-ray Absorption Near  Edge Spectroscopy and Mossbauer effect
              measurements to clarify  valence fluctuation behavior will be examined.
              Polarized Mossbauer  radiation sources will be used in the laboratory to
              delineate  anisotropic interactions near ferroelectric phase transitions.  
              Synchrotron-based Mossbauer measurements in the time-domain will be  made to
              study non-equilibrium behavior such as photon induced  states in ferroelectric
              materials.  %%%  The proposed research program is of an exploratory nature and
              may  have an important impact in providing new insights for the  understanding
              of ferroelectric materials and ferroelectric  behavior. The study of
              polarization phenomena is relevant to a  number of critical problems in
              ferroelectric thin films for non-  volatile memory applications. The dynamics
              of valence and  structural behavior in these materials and their analogues will
              be  explored by a combination of Mossbauer spectroscopy and synchrotron 
              radiation.  Polarized Mossbauer radiation sources will be used in  the
              laboratory to delineate anisotropic interactions near  ferroelectric phase
              transitions.  Synchrotron-based Mossbauer  measurements in the time-domain will
              be made to study non-  equilibrium behavior caused by radiation-induced states.
