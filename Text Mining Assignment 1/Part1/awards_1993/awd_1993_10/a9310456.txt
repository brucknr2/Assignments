Abstract    :
                   This is a planning grant to provide support to Arizona State              
              University to study the feasibility of developing a new concept                
              for bringing colleges and universities together with industry to               
              significantly improve on their current separate lifelong learning              
              efforts.  This will be done through a two-pronged approach.  The               
              first involves the co-location, perhaps at ASU Research Park, of               
              several industrial universities, Mesa Community College (MCC) and              
              ASU engineering/business professional development, and training                
              activities in a campus-like environment.  This co-location                     
              concept has been strongly endorsed by Motorola University and                  
              Intel University, and a steering committee has been formed to                  
              formulate a detailed plan in physical planning, programming,                   
              organizational structure and cost for further actions by the                   
              joint venture partners.   The second part of this two-pronged                  
              approach involves the establishment of a Cooperative Training and              
              Education Center for Life-Long Learning using the NSF/IUCRC                    
              model.  The purpose of this Center is to establish an educational              
              research and development arm to the jointly operated                           
              infrastructure.  Some specific examples of what the Center will                
              be involved in are: developing short-courses and training                      
              sessions to meet the industry demand; producing new course                     
              material including software; and experimenting with new teaching               
              paradigms and methodologies specific to life-long learning.                    
              Faculty of the Center will consist of faculty members of the                   
              industrial universities, a selected group of faculty at MCC and                
              ASU and outside contracted experts.                                            
                   The Program Director recommends Arizona State University be               
              awarded $25,000 ($12,500 co-funded by Engineering Education) for               
              six months for this planning grant.
