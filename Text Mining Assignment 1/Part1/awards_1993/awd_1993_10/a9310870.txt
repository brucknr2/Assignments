Abstract    :
              CTS-931087074  Clemson University  Douglas E. Hirt      ABSTRACT    Funds are
              provided with this research equipment grant for a scanning probe microscope
              system.  An interfacial polymerization technique is to be explored as a basis
              for imaging surface heterogeneities for improved production of low-cost,
              pitch-based carbon fibers.  High thermal conductivity carbon fibers and
              fiber-reinforced polymer matrices will also be studied by scanning probe
              techniques.    Materials development continues to be vital strategic research
              area with broad implications for industry.  With thermal conductivities three
              times that of copper, commercial carbon fibers can be used to pipe heat away in
              electronic devices or integrated circuits.  Fiber-reinforced polymer composites
              is a promising material as components for orthopedic joint replacement and
              fracture fixation.     AUTOEXECBAT            X  J     BURKA   PRE
