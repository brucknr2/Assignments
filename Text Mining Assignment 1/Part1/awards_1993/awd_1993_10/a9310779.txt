Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This Minority Research Initiation Planning Grant award supports the            
              development of a research proposal intended to produce an                      
              assessment of the degree to which critical elements of the                     
              political line of the Unified Black Movement (MNU) are distributed             
              among selected sectors of the Afro-Brazilian population in Bahia,              
              Brazil.                                                                        
                                                                                             
              If a successful proposal is developed, the research will produce               
              information about the ideological congruence between a prominent,              
              Brazilian Black consciousness organization and Afro-Brazilian mass             
              populations.  Such research will be of considerable interest for               
              understanding current and future Brazilian politics.
