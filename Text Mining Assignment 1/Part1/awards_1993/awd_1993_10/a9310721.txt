Abstract    :
              9310721   Montgomery       Berea College requests support from NSF for
              connection of  its campus network to SURAnet.  SURAnet is the midlevel network 
              located in the southeastern United States.  It will provide  operations
              management and information services and it will  provide Berea College with a
              56 thousand bits per second  connection to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45
              million bits per  second) National Backbone network.       The University needs
              greater functionality and network speed  to be able to access supercomputers,
              libraries, and make file  transfers along with being able to implement a more
              reliable mail  system. Students and faculty research will benefit from the
              link.   This is also a unique opportunity for the school to explore  innovative
              educational resources.  ***
