Abstract    :
              The purpose of this "high-risk, high-payoff" research is to                    
              develop, and make known to the research community, a new approach              
              to modeling aging, degradation and fracture of polymers.  This will            
              be accomplished by performing some preliminary research using novel            
              tools of geometry and analysis that are evolving from the                      
              relatively new mathematical fields of fractals and fraction                    
              calculus.  The PI will attempt to formulate a new, encompassing                
              field theory, "fractal continuum mechanics," that can be used to               
              bridge size scales in the study of the mechanics," that can be used            
              to bridge size scales in the study of the mechanics of materials.              
              This formulation will allow for the introduction of morphological              
              features at scales finer than the usual macroscale at which                    
              ordinary machine and structural analysis and design takes place.               
              It is necessary to take such "micro" features into account in order            
              to more thoroughly understand (and, thereby, more precisely model)             
              aging, degradation and fracture of materials.
