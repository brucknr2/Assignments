Abstract    :
              9310676  Prell       Besides their importance in the zooplankton and as links in
               the marine food web, foraminifera and radiolaria also produce  hard parts that
              contribute to the flux, respectively, of calcium  carbonate and opaline silica
              from the upper ocean to the sea  floor.  As part of the Arabian Sea Process
              Study, scientists from  the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and Brown
              University  will quantify the effects of the monsoon winds upon the  production
              of foraminifera and radiolaria and upon the flux of  their hard parts to the
              seafloor by examining samples taken from  plankton tows, sediment traps, and in
              sediment cores from the  seafloor.  Such studies should help us to understand
              both present-  day and historical patterns of oceanic biological production and
               particle flux associated with the monsoons.  ***
