Abstract    :
              9310116  LUCAS                                ABSTRACT    Based on a large
              videotaped corpus representative of the American  Deaf community, this study of
              sociolinguistic variation in American  Sign Language (ASL) will investigate two
              theoretical questions: 1)  Can the internal linguistic restraints on variation
              such as those  identified and described in spoken language studies be
              identified  and described for variation in ASL; 2) Similarly, can external 
              social constraints be identified and described and what kind of  model best
              accounts for the external constraints? Specifically, is  a traditional
              stratification model most appropriate or can a social  network analysis be used
              to account for individual variability, and  are there factors relevant to the
              determination of the network  score that may be unique to the American Deaf
              community? Videotaped  data will be collected in eight representative
              geographical  regions, in group sessions and in individual interviews.
              Informants  will include White and African_American native or near-native user 
              of ASL in three age groups controlled for socioeconomic status. The  data will
              be examined for phonological, lexical, and  morphosyntactic variables, and the
              internal and external  constraints on these variables will be described, using
              the Varbrul  program. Social network scores will be calculated for selected 
              informants and correlated for their linguistic behavior. The study  has both
              theoretical and practical importance: it will contribute  to our understanding
              of ASL as a human language at a time when the  instruction of ASL is rapidly
              expanding both for hearing adults and  children and for deaf children.   ***
