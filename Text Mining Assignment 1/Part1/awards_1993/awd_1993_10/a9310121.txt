Abstract    :
              ATM-9310121  Stuiver, Minze  University of Washington  Title: Atmospheric 14C
              the Ocean, and the Sun    The 14C/12C ratios of atmospheric CO2 are quite
              variable as they  reflect changes in 14C cosmic-ray production rate in the
              upper  atmosphere, as well as climate-dependent re-allocation of 14C  between
              the various earth carbon reservoirs.  This award supports  high-precision 14C
              measurements of early Holocene wood from the  German Pine chronology which will
              contribute to an improved  definition of the 14C/12C record back to 11,400
              calendar years  before  the present.  Causal factors for 14C/12C variability
              such as  climate  and solar influences will be identified and characterized
              with the  aid of carbon reservoir modeling.  Feedback mechanisms may play a 
              role.  High-precisionSeptember 27, 1993 measurements of materials  of the
              current millennium will also be utilized to understand  climatic factors. 
              Regional 14C/12C differences and North - South  latitudinal 14C/12C gradients
              will be defined.  Incorporating the  gradients into carbon reservoir models
              will lead to a better  definition of carbon cycle sinks and sources.
