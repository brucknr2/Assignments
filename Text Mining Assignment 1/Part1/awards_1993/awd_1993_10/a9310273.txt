Abstract    :
              9310273  Jiles    The primary objective of this research is to make a
              quantitative  examination of the relationships between microstructural
              parameters  of a model metal material and global magnetic property changes.  
              The metal is pure nickel, selected to avoid the complications of 
              microstructural changes, such as hard second phases, that could  complicate the
              analysis.  Cathodic charging is employed to form  hydrides at grain boundaries
              in the nickel and induce  microcavities.  Creep damage in nickel is assessed in
              terms of  cavity number density and average size of cavities and compared to 
              the bulk magnetic properties, coercivity and permeability.    %%%  This
              investigation could have technological impact in areas where  high temperature
              creep damage is a potential problem, such as in  steel components operating in
              power plants.  ***
