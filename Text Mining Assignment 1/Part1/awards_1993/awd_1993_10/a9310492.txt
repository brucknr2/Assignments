Abstract    :
              9310492  Nikravesh    This project deals with the development of innovative
              methodologies  and algorithms for analysis and design of multibody systems. the
               major objectives are to improve accuracy, computational efficiency,  and
              modeling capabilities in multibody analysis and optimal design,  A multibody
              system may consist of rigid and deformable bodies, a  control system,
              aerodynamic effects, and other interdisciplinary  subsystems. The approach
              includes real-time simulation using a  Silicon Graphics computer system
              dedicated to support research in  analysis and design of a variety of
              mechanical systems such as  algorithm and software development in pneumatic
              tire and road  interaction, four-wheel-steering vehicle control, tilt-wing 
              conversion and multisegment - multijoint biomechanical systems and  control.***
