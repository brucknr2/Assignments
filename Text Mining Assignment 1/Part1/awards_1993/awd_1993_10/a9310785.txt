Abstract    :
              9310785  Tilman        This study combines theory, observation, experiments, and
               paleoecology methods in a comprehensive and mechanistic  investigation of
              plant succession in coastal Lake Michigan sand  dunes. Experiments will
              distinguish among potential environmental  constraints limiting the
              distribution and abundance of plant  species along a complex gradient. The
              influence of water stress,   competition for water, nitrogen stress,
              competition for nitrogen,  competition for light, colonization constraints,
              sand burial, and  herbivory on seedling survival will be tested for six
              dominant  species in a seedling transplant experiment.   %%%  Knowledge derived
              from this research will determine the importance  of various constraints and
              tradeoffs during succession. The study  site is ideally suited for this
              research, and the attempt to  address the relative effects of several
              environmental factors is a  unique aspect of this project.  ***
