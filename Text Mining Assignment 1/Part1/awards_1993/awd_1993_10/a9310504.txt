Abstract    :
              9310504  Thomas    This study of a longitudinal data base examines the
              distribution of  cultural capital through extracurricular activities and the 
              relative impact of race and gender upon this social process and its  outcomes. 
              It draws upon the theories of Bourdieu and Passeron to  explain the interactive
              processes by which schools differentiate  learning opportunities through the
              knowledge associated with their  informal curricular outcomes.  The researchers
              will study 12  randomly-selected desegregated public high schools in six
              southern  cities over a retrospective 25 year period, employing both 
              qualitative and quantitative methods, including content analysis of  school
              yearbooks, validated with school site observations,  accreditation reports, and
              interviews.  %%%  The results of this research will contribute to sociological 
              theories of education, and they will strengthen the knowledge base  for policy
              decisions concerning school tracking and support for  various kinds of
              extracurricular activities.    ***
