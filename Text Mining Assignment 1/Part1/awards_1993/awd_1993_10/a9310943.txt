Abstract    :
              9310943  Measures       The investigator will determine the concentrations of 
              dissolved iron, aluminum, manganese, selenium, and beryllium at  numerous
              stations throughout the Arabian Sea during the U.S.JGOFS  Arabian Sea Process
              Study.  Because of their different  chemistries, these metals can be used as
              indicators of various  biological, geochemical, and hydrographic processes. 
              They also  are interesting biologically, because, with the exception of 
              beryllium, they are required by marine biota and yet are present  at very low
              levels in ocean water; in particular, iron has been  recently implicated in
              other U.S.JGOFS studies as a limiting  nutrient for oceanic production far from
              the continents.       Taking advantage of the fact that the seasonal monsoons 
              trigger environmental conditions promoting primary production in  the Arabian
              Sea, the investigator expects to study the quantity,  fate, and biological
              impact of trace metals delivered from the  surrounding land masses to the
              Arabian Sea in aerosol form by the  monsoon winds.  He will also study how
              seasonal low-oxygen  conditions in the AS water column affects trace metal
              reactions  and the relationship between regional hydrography and trace metal 
              geographic distribution.  In the long term, the PI expects that  this study
              will inform our understanding of trace  metal/biological/hydrological
              relationships in the context of the  global carbon cycle.  ***
