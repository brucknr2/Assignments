Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Mathematics curriculum reform has no significant effect on                
              what and how students learn unless classroom teachers learn about              
              newly developed ideas and methods and get support for integrating              
              them into their teaching.  Results of the Phase I Small Business               
              Innovation Research (SBIR) study establish the technical basis                 
              for a model of teacher inservice offering not only training and                
              follow-up but ongoing support.  The results also demonstrate that              
              there is an important opportunity for publishers of educational                
              materials to play a key role in providing inservice support for                
              their innovative materials which in turn support adherence to the              
              National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) Curriculum and              
              Evaluation Standards for School Mathematics.  The objectives of                
              the Phase II research focus on (1) continuing to develop and test              
              a professional development model; (2) extending the range of                   
              professional development workshops and institutes both                         
              geographically and beyond its Phase I substantive focus on                     
              geometry; (3) creating a series of videos that can be used to                  
              provide or supplement professional development workshops; (4)                  
              starting professional development leadership workshops cum                     
              associated materials; (5) publishing a newsletter on professional              
              development in secondary mathematics for workshop leaders,                     
              teachers, and mathematics supervisors; and (6) disseminating                   
              findings from Phases I and II.  The project aims to prepare large              
              numbers of teachers to use innovative materials effectively; to                
              apply its inservice mode in more schools in a variety of settings              
              (urban, suburban, rural); to propagate the successful                          
              professional development mode to other areas of mathematics                    
              education: problem solving, calculus, the core mathematics                     
              curriculum, and probability and statistics; to disseminate                     
              inservice economically and profitably, to research ways                        
              technology can be employed; and to promote effective integration               
              of innovative technology tools such as computer software and                   
              graphing calculators into mathematics teaching.                                
                                                                                             
              The project will contribute to the facilitation of sound                       
              curriculum change based on the premise that teachers are the key               
              to producing change in the classroom and professional development              
              is the key to reaching teachers with new ideas, content, methods               
              and materials.
