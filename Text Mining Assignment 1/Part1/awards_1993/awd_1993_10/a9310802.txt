Abstract    :
              9310802 Olmstead           This research involves the use of systematic and
              population level genetic analyses to study three endangered species of Puerto
              Rican amphibians.  Both mitochondrial and nuclear genes will be sequenced, and
              museum specimens of extinct populations will be used in the analysis. %%% Many
              amphibians, including toads, are declining at an alarming rate.  Active,
              multifaceted conservation programs are in effect for several species, including
              the endangered Wyoming toad, the threatened Puerto Rican crested toad, and
              boreal toad populations in Colorado.  Populations of all these species are
              declining, and there are on going efforts to monitor each species' populations.
               Unfortunately, the monitoring programs are occurring with little or no
              information on genetic variation within these species.  Genetic data are
              important to any conservation and restoration effort because they provide
              information on genetically unique populations and sibling species as well as
              information on lack of genetic variation and increased risk from inbreeding.
