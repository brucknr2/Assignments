Abstract    :
              9310244   Chester   We propose a program of Monte Carlo Simulation studies of
              phase  separation, domain growth and surface phenomena.  The aim of this  work
              is to apply the new Monte Carlo algorithm to a variety of  physical phenomena
              and to exploit the power of our parallel  machines to allow us to simulate
              large systems which display  complex inhomogeneous phenomena.
