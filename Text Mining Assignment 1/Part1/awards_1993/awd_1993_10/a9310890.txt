Abstract    :
              9310890  Grace   The ability to predict changes over time and in response to
              altered   environmental conditions has become a priority in ecology. By
              strengthening the   link between basic and applied research, ecologists can use
              information to   predict future impacts of habitat alterations on biodiversity
              and community   structure. The research in this Dissertation Improvement grant
              has two main   objectives: (1) to elucidate causal processes in coastal marsh
              communities, and   (2) test a structural equation model that will predict
              several attributes of   community structure from biotic and abiotic variables.
              The research involves   experimental manipulations of salinity, water level,
              soil fertility, and herbivory in   a Louisiana coastal marsh system. Examining
              the responses of communities to   experimental alterations over three growing
              seasons will provide evidence of the   effects of different variables on
              community structure and provide estimates on   potential rates of change in
              these systems.   %%%  In order to protect marshes from erosion and damage due
              to salt water intrusion   and sea level rise, resource managers must first know
              how these variables affect   marsh communities. The development and testing of
              a model to predict marsh   community structure will not only help preserve
              these threatened systems, but   will move the field of ecology closer to being
              a more predictive science.  ***
