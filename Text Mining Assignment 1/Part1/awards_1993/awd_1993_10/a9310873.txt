Abstract    :
              9310873  Hu  Laser scanning confocal microscopy, with its  ability to
              discriminate against out-of-focus  fluorescence and to yield high in-plane 
              resolution, is a powerful tool for three  dimensional imaging.  Compared to
              many other  analytical tools, such as electron microscopy,  it is relatively
              non-destructive and  non-invasive.  Biological systems are  inherently
              three-dimensional.  The interior of  a specimen, ranging from a single cell of
              a  few micrometer thickness to tissues of  hundreds of micrometers in depth,
              can be  discerned with a confocal microscope.  This  Award will provide a
              confocal microscope to  facilitate the following projects:  (1)  Development of
              a bioartificial liver; (2)  Studies of invasive behavior and cytoskeleton 
              distribution in metastatic cells; (3)  Fabrication of a designer path for cell 
              migration in three dimensional gels; (4)  Cytoskeletal reorganization during
              rabbit  corneal epithelial cell adhesion; (5)  Development of dynamic nutrient
              feeding  strategy for high density mammalian cell  bioreactors; and (6)
              Determination of the  partitioning function in cell division.
