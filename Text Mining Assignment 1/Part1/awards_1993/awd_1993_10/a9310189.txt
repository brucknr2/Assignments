Abstract    :
                9310189  Council    Different personality constructs are often assessed during
              the  same research session.  Although widely employed, this  methodology may be
              vulnerable to context effects.  Context  effects occur when the taking of one
              personality scale influences  scores on another scale administered in the same
              assessment  context.  This project will systematically investigate context 
              effects in personality assessment through examining their cause,  their degree
              and scope, and possible remedies.  The goal of the  research is to improve on
              previous research through testing  predictions from a general theory of context
              effects in  personality assessment and confining the context to a specific 
              domain of personality, negative affectivity.  The desired outcome  of the
              research is to provide better information on the  generalizability of context
              effects.    ***
