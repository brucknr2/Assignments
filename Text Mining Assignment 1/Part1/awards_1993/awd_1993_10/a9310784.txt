Abstract    :
                                                                            9310784  Frost 
              This action is to support the development of a combined  resonant column,
              torsional shear apparatus suitable for  testing a broad range of geo-materials
              over the full range  of strains of engineering interest.  The device is to be 
              used to support research into the dynamic behavior of large  particle
              geo-materials, including gravelly soils, refuse  fills and waste modified
              soils; in order to develop a better  understanding and framework for predicting
              variations in the  shear modulus and damping of these materials as a function 
              of applied shear stress.  ***
