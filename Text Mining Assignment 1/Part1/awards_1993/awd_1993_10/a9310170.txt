Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This project investigates:  (1) recent changes in the nature              
              and strength of the links between academic research and                        
              industrial innovation in various industries, (2) differences                   
              among small, medium-sized and large firms in the extent to which               
              their innovations are based on recent academic research and in                 
              the ways in which they tap into, use, and interact with academic               
              research, (3) differences between U.S. and foreign firms in the                
              extent to which their innovations in recent years have been based              
              on academic research, (4) factors associated with the successful               
              transfer to industry of the knowledge and know how resulting from              
              research carried out by universities, and (5) factors leading                  
              academic researchers to do work regarded by firms as being                     
              significant contributions to their product and process                         
              innovations.                                                                   
                                                                                             
                   The purpose is to shed new light on each of these important               
              topics.  Building on our previous work in this area, data from                 
              firms in the information processing, electronics, chemical,                    
              instruments, pharmaceutical, metals, and petroleum industries is               
              collected and analyzed as well as data/information from a sample               
              of academic researchers who have been cited by firms in these                  
              industries as having made particularly significant contributions               
              to their product and process innovations.  Based on detailed data              
              of this sort, statistical analyses will be carried out, the                    
              results of which should be of use to decision makers attempting                
              to increase the economic payoff from the nation's academic                     
              research.
