Abstract    :
              9310702  Buesseler       One of the major research objectives of the U.S.JGOFS 
              Arabian Sea Process Study is measurement of the vertical and  horizontal
              transport rates of particulate material, especially  particulate organic
              carbon, in the Arabian Sea.  Particle export  from the surface layers of the
              ocean is of particular interest  because that is the zone where new biological
              particles are  formed, grazed, and physically altered, and then enter the 
              decomposition cycle that regenerates dissolved nutrients.  Although some
              investigators will be making such estimates by  setting out open canisters at
              different depths and measuring the  amount of material that collects in them
              over time, such efforts  have a number of built-in uncertainties.       The
              principal investigator of the present project, will  approach the problem of
              estimating particle export from the  surface ocean in a radically different
              way, on that will serve as  an independent check on the sediment trap
              estimates.  His  approach takes advantage of the fact that the dissolved
              uranium  in seawater decays to produce a radioactive daughter, thoraium-  234
              (half-life-24 days), which (unlike the uranium) strongly  attaches to
              particles. By sampling particles within and below the  mixed upper water layer
              and measuring their TH-234 content and  using some simple mathematical models,
              the investigator will be  able to estimate particle from the mixed layer to
              depth.  By  measuring carbon and nitrogen contents of these materials, he  will
              also be able to estimate fluxes of those two elements.  A  regional particulate
              carbon flux picture for the Arabian Sea  region will be built up by using the
              data from some 25 stations  collected during two monsoonal seasons (summer and
              winter) and  two intermonsoonal periods.  ***
