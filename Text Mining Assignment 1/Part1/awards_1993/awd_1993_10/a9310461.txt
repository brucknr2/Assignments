Abstract    :
              9310461  Nielson    This project is concerned with the establishment of an 
              interdisciplinary undergraduate research laboratory for the  systematic
              prediction and characterization of new inorganic  ferroelectric materials.  The
              three-year project is expected to  increase significantly the number of known
              ferroelectric materials  which now stands at about 200.  Ferroelectrics are of
              increasing  importance in the fabrication of electrooptic devices, integrated 
              circuits, pyroelectric detectors, and piezoelectric transducers.   The project
              involves the prediction of ferroelectric behavior in  new materials based on
              analysis of previously published  crystallographic data; the high temperature
              formation of these  materials in poly crystalline form; verification by X-ray
              analysis  that the materials have the expected structure; specimen  processing;
              and subsequent measurement of the dielectric and  thermodynamic properties of
              these materials as a function of  temperature to confirm the predicted
              ferroelectric property.  The  project is designed to offer a series of
              attractive undergraduate  research topics and will in addition encourage the
              participants to  follow careers in physics and chemistry.  ***
