Abstract    :
              9310484  Popper    This U.S.-Russian Workshop on Comparative Sensory Biology is
              organized by dr. Arthur N.  Popper of the University of Maryland, College Park
              and Dr. Mikhail A. Ostrovsky of the  Institute of Chemical Physics of the
              Russian Academy of Sciences and professor at Moscow  State University.  In past
              years, it has become apparent that different animal species have  evolved the
              ability to extract a good deal of sensory information within their environment.
                While some of these senses, such as vision and hearing, are similar in
              aquatic and terrestrial  animals, many aquatic animals have evolved special
              techniques for extracting and processing  information.  In addition to the more
              "traditional" senses, the lateral line and electroreception  are found uniquely
              in aquatic species.  To date, there has been only a single international 
              meeting on sensory systems of aquatic animals and one on comparative sensory
              systems, in  1987.  Due to the political climate, no Russians were included in
              the meeting.  Only a few  Russians were included in a more general 1982
              meeting.  At the same time, there has been  very active research in Russia in
              various areas of comparative sensory biology and evolution  of sensory systems.
               Thus, this workshop will enable U.S. and Russian scientist to benefit  from
              the interchange of ideas and from potential bilateral collaborations.  The
              workshop  topics will be limited to three sensory systems: electroreception,
              mechanoreception (hearing  and the lateral line), and vision.    This research
              in zoology fulfills the program objectives of advancing science by enabling 
              leading experts in the U.S. and Russia to combine complementary talents and
              pool research  resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
