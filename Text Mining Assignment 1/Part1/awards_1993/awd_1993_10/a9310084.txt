Abstract    :
              9310084  Yamada       Existing laboratory facilities will be enhanced to create
              a  major facility for magnetic reconnection experiments (MRX).   Magnetic
              reconnection is a key physical process in magnetospheric  physics, solar
              physics, and astrophysical plasmas generally.   Topological changes in magnetic
              field line configuration often  result in large JxB forces with release of
              magnetic energy into MHD  flows and the creation of topologically distinct
              plasmoid  configurations.  The MRX will be used to investigate the  fundamental
              topology of microscale reconnection regions as well as  the global MHD flows
              and equilibria.  Plasma scaling is established  to be very relevant to space
              plasma conditions with a large  Lundquist number (or magnetic Reynolds number)
              of about 2000 and  many gyroradii in the system (about 100).  A flexible double
               spheromak configuration will be used under various initial states  to measure
              (1) whether reconnection processes remain axisymmetric  or whether
              three-dimensional phenomena will spontaneously break  out, (2) how the
              reconnection rate depends on the helicity of  mergin spheromaks, (3) the
              dependence of reconnection rate on  global MHD forces which can be controlled
              via currents in the MRX  coils and cores, (4) flow fields associated with
              reconnection and  the transformation to heat, and (5) the evolution of patchy 
              reconnection where plasmas converge to a point instead of along a  line. 
              Diagnostics will include magnetic and Langmuir probe arrays,  an imaging
              interferometer, and flow visualization via high-speed  photography of vaporized
              impurity pellots.  Preliminary experiments  on double spheromaks have already
              been carried out on the TS-3  device at the University of Tokyo.   ***
