Abstract    :
              9310256  Siwicki    Why do we go to bed at night and get up in the morning?
              Because our  behavior is governed by a circadian rhythm. Our brain contains a 
              clock that cycles with a 24 hour periodicity. It turns out that the  behavior
              of most organisms, even fruit flies, is governed by such  a clock. Animals like
              the fruit fly provide model systems where the  genetics and the molecular
              biology of rhythms can be studied in  detail. With this NSF grant, NSF
              Presidential Young Investigator  Kathleen Siwicki will develop a new model
              system for the study of  circadian rhythms. During the last grant period she
              showed that the  same gene governs rhythms in drosophila and manduca.  Manduca,
               however, has much larger neurons, and Dr. Siwicki will be able to  record from
              them and discover how their behavior changes as a  result of manipulations of
              the rhythm gene. Since there is good  evidence that similar genes govern
              rhythmic behavior in all  organisms, the results on Manduca will be applicable
              to the study  of cylic disorders in human such as sleep disturbances, eating 
              disorders, and seasonal affective disorder.***
