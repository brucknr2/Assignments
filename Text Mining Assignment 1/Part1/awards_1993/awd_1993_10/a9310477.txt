Abstract    :
              9310477  Harris  The research entails the study of spacelike hypersurfaces in 
              general relativity theory.  These are surfaces which can  represent the
              physical universe at a given instant of time  according to a given class of
              observers.  The investigator wishes  to investigate whether all such surfaces
              in tempered spacetimes  are topologically the same and are observer-time
              invariant.   Also, he he intends studying singular points where the spacetime 
              geometry collapses in terms of curvature singularities.  Techniques from
              pseudo-Riemannian geometry will be exploited.  This research is very pertinent
              to the theoretical understanding  of `black-hole' phenomena.
