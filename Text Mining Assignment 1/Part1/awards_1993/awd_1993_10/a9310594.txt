Abstract    :
              9310594  MILLERO    The principal investigator will share with another
              collaborating  scientist the task of making core measurements of the seawater 
              carbon dioxide-carbonate system during the pelagic processes  cruises of the
              Arabian Sea Process Study.  Two of four measurements  -- total dissolved
              inorganic carbon, the partial pressure of carbon  dioxide (pCO2), total
              alkalinity, and the pH -- are necessary for  characterizing the entire
              carbonate equilibrium system. On some  occasions. However, full sets of
              measurements will be made to  "overdetermine" the system as a check on internal
              consistency. Both  atmospheric and surface water pCO2 will be measured
              continuously  along the cruise track. This kind of information is fundamental
              to  understanding carbon dioxide dynamics at the level of sea-air  exchange and
              on a global scale.
