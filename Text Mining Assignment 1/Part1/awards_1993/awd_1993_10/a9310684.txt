Abstract    :
              9310684  HEDGES      Because of the monsoons-driven seasonality of primary
              production in  the Arabian Sea, the Arabian Sea Process Study affords an 
              opportunity to follow a variety of biomarker compounds from their  point of
              origin in the photic zone to their eventual burial and  preservation in
              seafloor sediments.  In this project, the principal  investigators will sample
              and characterize some 100 different  particulate biochemical compounds --
              lipids, pigments, amino acids,  and carbohydrates -- at their point of origin
              in the surface ocean,  through transformation in deeper water as they settle in
              particular  form to the seafloor, and in surficial and subsurface sediments.  
              Analysis of data collected during and between monsoon events will  permit the
              investigators to characterize the reactivity and  transformations of these
              organic substances and to assess their  potential for sedimentary preservation
              as marine paleoenvironmental  indicators.
