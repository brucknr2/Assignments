Abstract    :
              This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic                  
              Chemistry Program supports research on alkane functionalization                
              by Dr. Dean M. Roddick of the Chemistry Department, University                 
              of Wyoming.  Iridium complexes of (fluoroalkyl)phospine ligands                
              will be surveyed for catalytic cycloalkane dehydrogenation                     
              activity and, in some cases, the mechanism of the reaction will                
              be determined.  New iridum   complexes containing weakly                       
              coordinating ligands and new ruthenium hydride compounds will                  
              by synthesized and examined for alkane activation reactivity.                  
              Because of the stability of (fluoroalkyl)phospine ligands in                   
              acidic and in oxidizing conditions, the possibility of C-H                     
              activation followed by hydrogen scavenging, olefin oxidation or                
              direct metal-alkyl oxidations will be investigated.  The                       
              suitability of this class of compounds for catalytic aldehyde                  
              and alcohol decarbonylation will also be tested.                               
              %%%                                                                            
              The fluoronated alkylphosphine group which is attached to the                  
              metal withdraws electronic charge from the vicinity of the                     
              metal but, unlike other groups which can also accomplish this,                 
              is resistant to thermal or oxidative degradation.  Because of                  
              this stability, the compounds synthesized have potential for                   
              practical use in the design of reagents and catalysts to                       
              functionalize alkanes.  Petroleum and natural gas technology                   
              would be influenced by a successful outcome.
