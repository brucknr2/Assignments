Abstract    :
              CTS-9310768   Gordon Research Conference   Csaba G. Horvath            ABSTRACT 
                        Funds from this award will be used to assist with the travel   costs
              for participants in the Gordon Research Conference on   "Reactive Polymers,
              Ion-Exchangers and Adsorbents" to be held   August 22-27, 1993.  The central
              topics for the meeting will be   (1) preparation and characterization of
              ultrapure water, (2) novel  sorbent-configurations for enhancement of
              efficiency, (3) catalysis  by polymers, (4) advances in reactive polymers, (5)
              interaction of  proteins with surfaces, (6) chiral separations and (7)  
              chromatography of proteins.        This small conference is an important
              meeting for stimulating  new research directions and for the exchange of ideas
              across   traditional disciplines.  The choice of subject areas for the  
              meeting is timely as there is considerable current interest in   problems
              associated with water purification and chiral separations.
