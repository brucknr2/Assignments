Abstract    :
              9310181  Rusak    Theoretical research is to be carried out of the vortex
              breakdown  phenomenon with an approach utilizing helical symmetry. With the 
              governing equations based on a helical coordinate system, various  asymptotic
              and numerical solutions will be obtained bearing on:  standing helical waves,
              developing stagnation regions, failure of  boundary layer approximations, and
              conical flows with helical  symmetry.     New criteria for the onset of
              breakdown in swirling flows are to be  developed from such solutions. Vortex
              breakdown occurs on aircraft  and in internal flows with swirl, such as for
              example combustion  systems in boilers. Its mechanisms are as yet only
              incompletely   understood.  ***
