Abstract    :
              9310328  Mallet-Paret       We propose to study fundamental qualitative
              properties of  several classes of dynamical systems which arise in various
              areas  of science. Among the systems of interest are those involving  geometric
              theory of singularly perturbed differential equations,  differential delay
              equations, and associated linear problems.       We propose to study
              fundamental qualitative properties of  several classes of dynamical systems
              which arise in various areas  of science. The dynamical systems model a wide
              range of important  phenomena in a number of areas of science.  Among them are 
              problems of cell population growth (modeling various disease  processes),
              problems of fluid flow, and problems involving  interaction of diffusion and
              chemical reaction.  ***
