Abstract    :
                  This award will support the development of tools and new methods  by which
              genomic DNA sequences can be surveyed for specific types  of regulatory sites. 
              These methods will be based on assessments  of whether candidate sites having
              base sequence consistent with  regulatory function also have the
              physical-chemical attributes  necessary for activity.  Specific types of
              regulatory regions to  be considered include origins of replication, and the
              various  types of functional loci involved with transcriptional regulation 
              such as promoters, terminators, enhancers, poly-adenylations  sites and
              silencers.  The project will focus on yeast and human  DNA.
