Abstract    :
              9310683  Nelson  This collaborative project continues a line of research aimed
              at  developing better measures of risk in financial markets.  The 
              investigators have already developed a number of promising   procedures for
              characterizing time-varying risk in asset markets.   Two of the most popular
              strategies adopted by researchers and  practitioners to accommodate this time-
              varying risk are rolling  regressions and ARCH  models.  The research to be
              undertaken with  this award will involve further development and refining of
              both  these strategies.  This continued line of research is extremely  valuable
              because measuring asset riskiness is of fundamental  importance both for
              investment theory and practice.  ***   9310331  Foster  This collaborative
