Abstract    :
              9310731  Grumet    Ng-CAM is a neuronal cell adhesion molecule (CAM) that is a 
              potent promoter of cell adhesion and axon growth.  An Ng-CAM molecule on one
              cell can bind to another Ng-CAM molecule on an adjacent cell (homophilic
              binding).  Ng-CAM can also bind to other cell surface proteins.  The goal of
              this project is to identify regions in the Ng-CAM molecule that mediate
              homophilic binding.  To identify regions in Ng-CAM that mediate homophilic
              binding, established assays will be used to test the properties of Ng-CAM
              polypeptides representing different regions of the molecule.  Different regions
              of Ng-CAM will be generated either by genetic engineering or by cleaving the
              native protein into small subunits.  Various regions within the molecule will
              be tested for their ability to bind to intact Ng-CAM and eventually for binding
              to fragments of the molecule.  Neuronal adhesion and axon growth to surfaces
              coated with the various forms of Ng-CAM will then be measured.  Identification
              of homophilic binding region(s) in Ng-CAM is an essential foundation for
              analyzing molecular interactions that mediate or control neuronal adhesion and
              axon growth.  These studies will therefore allow a better understanding of the
              types of molecular interactions that control key aspects of brain development.
