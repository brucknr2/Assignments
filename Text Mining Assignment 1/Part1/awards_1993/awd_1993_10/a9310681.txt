              proposal is being funded in parallel with a substantially identical one by
              Professor Yablonovich.  In a collaborative Caltech/UCLA effort the PI proposes
              a n experimental program to develop and test the technology for making 3
              dimensional dielectric/metallic photonic crystal structures on the scale of
              optical wavelengths.  These should lend themselves to practical implementation
              in opto electronic technology and might be generically useful in optical
              science. ****
