Abstract    :
              9310222  Hochheimer  This project employs unique high pressure and Brillouin
              light  scattering techniques to investigate lattice dynamics, elastic  behavior
              and phase transitions in materials exhibiting  incommensurate phases.  The
              materials being investigated include  selenates and halides and have been
              chosen as model systems which  should provide tests of recent theories of
              incommensurate phase  transitions.  The research will provide a better
              understanding of  the coupling of acoustic phonons to excitations in the 
              incommensurate phase, and will provide additional information about  the role
              of anharmonic lattice potentials in the phase behavior.   The research will
              provide fundamental information about solid state  phase transitions which are
              important in many practical materials  such as ferroelectric solids.  %%%  This
              is a fundamental study of the effect of pressure on the  arrangement of atoms
              in solids that can show an unusual long range  (larger that the crystal unit
              cell) modulation of the atomic  positions in the solids.  The reasons for phase
              transitions and  changes in the atomic positions of the atoms in the materials
              under  study are not well understood.  They are important and underlie  phase
              behavior in other solids, such as ferroelectric materials of  technological
              importance.  The changes in atomic positions will be  investigated with both
              x-ray and optical spectroscopy techniques.  ***
