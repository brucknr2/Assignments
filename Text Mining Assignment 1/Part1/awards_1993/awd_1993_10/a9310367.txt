Abstract    :
              9310367  Steward    Neurons in the brain are interconnected with one-another
              forming many complex circuits.  When a neuronal circuit is activated by certain
              patterns of activity, there is a change in the strength of the connections
              between nerve cells in that circuit. The most typical change is that it
              subsequently requires less input to activate the circuit. This is called
              long-term potentiation (LTP). LTP is especially prominent in brain regions that
              are important for learning and memory and is, therefore, believed to be
              involved in the mechanism for information storage in the nervous system.
              Because the changes induced during LTP endure for weeks or more, it has been
              proposed that this change results from the growth of new connections between
              neurons. This project will test this hypothesis directly. Quantitative electron
              microscopy will be used to determine if the induction of LTP leads to the
              formation of new connections between neurons. The results of this project will
              potentially offer new insights into the mechanisms of learning and memory.  ***
