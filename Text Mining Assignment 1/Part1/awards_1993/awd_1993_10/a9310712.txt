Abstract    :
              This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the work of              
              Professor William J. le Noble at the State University of New York              
              at Stony Brook to study the electronic origins of pi-                          
              diastereofacial selectivity by using various substituted                       
              adamantan-2-ones and related compounds. The specific projects                  
              are: (1) addition reactions, including dihydroxylation, Grob                   
              fragmentation, Michael addition, and Claisen rearrangement; (2)                
              studies directed to differentiate between the theoretical models               
              of Ahn, Cieplak, and Felkin; (3) changes in skeleton and                       
              substitution patterns by expanding/reducing adamantane by one                  
              methylene unit at C6, by studying more powerful 5-substituent                  
              effects (N-oxides and boron and ammonium compounds), by studying               
              the 4,9-disubstitution effect, by studying the 5,7-disubstitution              
              effect, and by modifying the trigonal center at C2.                            
              %%%                                                                            
              In this project Professor William K. le Noble will study the                   
              electronic effects that govern pi-diastereofacial selectivities                
              in bond making (and breaking) to (and from) ketones, imines, and               
              olefins. The adamantane frame is selected to eliminate                         
              interfering steric and conformational effects. The study                       
              concentrates on standard addition reaction, differentiating                    
              between theoretical models, and will explore the influence of                  
              powerful substituents and structural rigidity.
