Abstract    :
                Koch  It is proposed to study simple atoms, hydrogen and helium, in  strong
              electromagnetic fields consisting of one frequency or two  frequencies, without
              or with added stochastic components (noise).  Its objective is to understand
              periodically driven quantal  systems whose classical counterpart is chaotic,
              thus addressing  questions in the interdisciplinary area of quantum chaos.  New
               experiments will make a detailed investigation into the effect of  stochastic
              components (noise) added to the strong oscillatory  microwave fields.  A new
              program of research will investigate the  detailed behavior of low-pressure,
              dc-biased, radio-frequency gas  discharges as a nonlinear dynamical system.
