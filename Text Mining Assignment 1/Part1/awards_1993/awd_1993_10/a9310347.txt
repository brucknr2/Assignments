Abstract    :
              9310347  Daniel Friedman    This research examines how people learn in
              nondeterministic tasks  (such as medical diagnosis).  Learning is difficult
              such tasks  because occasionally a decision maker can be right for the wrong 
              reason or (like an expert doctor with an inconclusive chart) wrong  for the
              right reason.  In experimental settings we will vary the  complexity of the
              task, the type of decision required, and the  learning environment in order to
              see when people are able learn  effectively and when they do not.    An example
              of the type of task would be medical decision making.   A doctor examining a
              medical chart mentally combines the  information from each separate symptom and
              makes a diagnosis.   Doctors' diagnostic abilities increase over time as they
              learn more  about the informativeness of each symptom and how best to combine 
              the information.  Often the chart information is inconclusive, so  even the
              best doctor sometimes makes an incorrect diagnosis.  This  kind of task appears
              frequently in other decision domains.    Economists and some other social
              scientists use equilibrium models  that in effect assume instantaneous
              learning, and results of this  study should be useful in showing where these
              models are likely to  be accurate or inaccurate.  The results also should be
              directly  useful to cognitive scientists and decision makers (including 
              medical diagnosticians) who wish to improve the learning process in 
              nondeterministic tasks.    ***
