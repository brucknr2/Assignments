Abstract    :
              9310753  Huang  We propose to carry out a comprehensive investigation of the 
              Uranian and Neptunian magnetospheres.  The investigation includes   the
              following aspects:  (1)  The guiding center motion of charged particles and the
              plasma  bulk properties along a field line in the magnetospheres with large 
              offset and tilted dipole (OTD) magnetic field;   (2)  The formation and
              configuration of the plasmaspheres at Uranus  and Neptune;   (3)  The
              magnetospheric dynamics, especially the current systems  and their effects on
              the mass and energy transports and the  stability of the OTD magnetospheres; 
              (4)  The sources and transport processes of the plasma in the  Uranian and
              Neptunian magnetospheres,  The proposed studies will be developed on the basis
              of our previous  work, the studies on the motion of chareged particles in the 
              magnetospheres with spin axis aligned magnetic dipole field  Huang  et al.,
              1988 , the spatial variations of density and temperature  along a magnetic
              field line in an anisotropic rotating  magnetospheric plasma  Huang and
              Birmingham, 1992  and the 3D  description of magnetosphere in a OTD frame 
              Huang and Sittler,  1993 .  They will also be guided by observational data. 
              The  results of these studies would increase our understanding of the  Uranian
              and Neptunian magnetospheres as well of the terrestrial  magnetosphere.  ***
