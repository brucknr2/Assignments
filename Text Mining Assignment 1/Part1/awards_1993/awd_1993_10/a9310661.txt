Abstract    :
              9310661  BROWN      In a collaborative effort scientists at the University of
              Miami and  North Carolina State University will collect, process, and 
              disseminate satellite sensor data for the U.S. JGOFS Arabian Sea  Process Study
              (ASPS). To support cruise activities in near-real  time, large data sets from
              satellite flyovers will be processed and  transmitted between the University of
              Miami and research vessels.   Data transmission to land-based planning sites
              will be done via  Internet. The scientific team will also maintain an archive
              of both  unprocessed satellite data and processed data products (such as  daily
              and weekly chlorophyll concentrations, sea surface  temperature, reflectance,
              etc.) for post-cruise analysis. The  specific end products from the data
              processing and the  methodologies for retrieving data will be determined in 
              consultation with other ASPS investigators.
