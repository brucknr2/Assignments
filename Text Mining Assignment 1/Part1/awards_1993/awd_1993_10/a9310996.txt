Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT--CTS-9310996  The proposal is for equipment that would allow
              simultaneous Raman scattering measurements and OH fluorescence imaging on
              turbulent jet flames to be carried out.  The equipment consists of a back-lit
              CCD camera, a lens coupled intensifier, and associated hardware.  The camera
              will allow instantaneous imaging of the important chemical species and
              structure of the turbulent reaction zones leading to a better understanding of
              the effects of dissipation rate and flame curvature on the finite-rate
              chemistry occurring in these flames.  This new camera can enhance the Raman
              detection limits sensitivity and measurement accuracy over the old ICCD camera
              presently available.  The old camera will be used for the OH (PLIF)
              fluorescence imaging measurements.
