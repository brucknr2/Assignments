Abstract    :
              9310264  Newton  This project is to investigate the thermodynamic stabilities 
              of many different major minerals, including silicates,  oxides, hydrates and
              carbonates.  The data to be acquired  are of crucial importance to the erection
              of thermodynamic  datasets for calculation of the stabilities of natural 
              mineral assemblages.  The concentration will be on important  mineral species
              whose thermodynamic properties are still  uncertain.  Because of the
              interdependent nature of mineral  properties in the self-consistent datasets,
              insertion of  accurately-measured free energies, enthalpies and entropies  of
              key minerals will force changes of the thermodynamic  parameters of most of the
              other minerals of the datasets.  Free energy data of solid solution will be
              measured for  several important mineral families.  Methods to be used are 
              simple-system phase equilibrium measurements at elevated  temperatures and
              pressures, including experiments in the  presence of a single-component or
              mixed vapor phase and with  polyionic oxide melts, and solution calorimetry. 
              Major  improvement in the ability to calculate heterogeneous  equilibria of
              earth processes will result from accurate  definition of the thermodynamic
              formation and solid solution  properties of key garnets, pyroxenes, feldspars,
              micas and  carbonate minerals.
