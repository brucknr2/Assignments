Abstract    :
              9310342  Stahl  This U.S.-Argentina Program award will support the 
              collaboration of Philip Stahl of Washington University and  Luis Mayorga of the
              University of Cuyo in Mendoza,  Argentina.  The project aims to advance
              knowledge of  phagocytosis, a receptor-mediated process carried out by 
              eucaryotic cell types specializing in host defense.    The project will explore
              mechanisms whereby phagosomes,  containing newly internalized materials, fuse
              with the  appropriate intracellular vesicles (endosomes) to achieve  targeting
              of the endocytosed materials.  This is an  important process for eukaryotic
              cells, with broad  implications for such diverse processes as food uptake in 
              unicellular organisms, vertebrate immune functions, the  function of retinal
              photoreceptors in vision, and general  homeostasis in multicellular organisms. 
              The U.S. group will  focus on the reconstitution of fusion events in 
              permeabilized cell preparations and in identifying protein  factors.  The
              Argentine group will use magnetic latex  spheres to purify phagosomes and to
              determine the role of  receptors in intracellular fusion events.  ***
