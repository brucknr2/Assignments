Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT -- CTS-9310196  SELL      The PI has proposed a Career Advancement
              Award project which would allow her to develop a degree of expertise in
              combustion in order to optimize and evaluate the burning of spent pulping
              liquors and to investigate the specific combustion characteristics of these
              fuels.  The PI hopes to gain the necessary expertise in combustion through the
              interaction with consultants such as Dr. Grace formerly at the Institute of
              Paper Science and Technology (IPST), a world authority in black liquor
              combustion and Dr. Sonnenberg, presently at IPST.      The PI intends to focus
              her efforts on the combustion and combustion properties of spent sulfite
              liquors from which about 70% of the sulfur has been removed by a new process of
              acidification and evaporation developed by the PI.  The techniques learned here
              could also be applied to  potential fuels such as sludges and fiber rejects.
