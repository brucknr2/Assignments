Abstract    :
                9310099  McGrath     This research extends and expands work on the impact of
              experience  and change on the use of electronic technology in work groups that 
              is currently funded by the Information Technology and Organizations  Program. 
              The research will examine: The extent to which  differences between
              communication media endure when groups accrue  considerable experience with
              relatively new media;  Both the  disruptive and the empowering effects of
              sudden shifts in  technology on process and performance of work groups; The
              role of  group autonomy, of particular divisions of labor, and of prior 
              stability/variation in major facets of the group, on how well work  groups
              adapt to technological (and other) changes; and the  conditions under which
              various forms of system change or  restructuring are likely to result from
              changes in group technology  (or group tasks and membership composition).
