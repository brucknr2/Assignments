Abstract    :
              This award will fund the expenses of ten participants of the                   
              American Institute for Medical and Biological Engineering (AIMBE)              
              annual meeting who will address scientific and technological                   
              topics.  This conference will be held in Washington, DC on March               
              8-9, 1993.  The topics of the conference will include: 1)                      
              Perspectives on Health Care in America; 2) Health Care Economics               
              and Management; 3) Information and Communication Technologies in               
              Health Care; 4) Future Biomedical Technologies.  The areas that                
              will be addressed by this conference emerged from the                          
              recommendations of a NSF/Whitaker Foundation sponsored workshop                
              on Technologies for Health Care Reduction.  This is an area of                 
              interest to the Bioengineering programs in NSF and one which the               
              possibility of further emphasis is being explored.  The meeting                
              should help stimulate research by the engineering community into               
              this area of national concern.
