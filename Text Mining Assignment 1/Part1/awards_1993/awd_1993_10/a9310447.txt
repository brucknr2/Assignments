Abstract    :
              Lawler  This grant supports travel expenses for graduate students to  attend the
              46th annual Gaseous Electronic Conference in Montreal,  Quebec, October 19-22,
              1993.  The program emphasizes novel  experimental techniques of collision
              physics and serves as a  forum for topics on the boundary between basic science
              and  several fields of applied and interdisciplinary science.  The  meeting is
              sponsored by the Division of Atomic, Molecular and  Optical Physics of the APS.
