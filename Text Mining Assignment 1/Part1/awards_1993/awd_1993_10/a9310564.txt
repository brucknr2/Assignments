Abstract    :
              9310564  Ryan    With this Research Planning Grant, Dr. Ryan will study the
              various  techniques necessary to improve the hydrocode that is used to model 
              impact events.  A major process affecting the growth and evolution  of
              planetary bodies is hypervelocity impact.  Although some of the  basic
              principles of impact phenomena are moderately well  understood, how material
              fragments near the impact site and how  initial conditions affect that
              fragmentation have been difficult  to quantify.
