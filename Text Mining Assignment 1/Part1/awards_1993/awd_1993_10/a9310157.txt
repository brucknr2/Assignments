Abstract    :
              9310157  Bhattacharjee       This research continues theoretical studies on the
              effect of  resistivity on current sheets in the solar corona.  The work 
              completed during the last two years has led to significant new  insights on
              where and how rapidly in time current sheets tend to  form in a long, thin
              coronal tube in the presence of small but  finite resistivity.  The continuing
              effort will be based on 3D  coronal equilibria with high symmetry and a
              generalized Ohm's law  that includes not only resistivity but also other
              collisionless  mechanisms of relevance to the corona.  The 3D equilibria will
              be  investigated for separatrix formation, analytically and  numerically, since
              singularities tend to form at separatrices.  The  inclusion of these
              collisionless mechanisms will introduce  qualitatively new dynamical effects
              and bring theory closer to  observations.***
