Abstract    :
              9310931  Israel Wachs    A Fourier-transform infrared spectrometer is being
              acquired to  support research in catalysis.  It will be used in studies of 
              layered surface metal oxide, mixed metal oxide, sulfated metal  oxide, sulfonic
              resin, and bimetallic catalysts.  ***
