Abstract    :
              The project concerns three topics:                                              
                                                                                            
              (1)  Concepts of dependence and asymmetry of multivariate                      
                   distributions and product integrals: we consider a                        
                   class of tests for exchangeability of multivariate                        
                   random vectors subject to censoring.                                      
                                                                                             
                   The tests are based on symmetrized hazard functions and                   
                   derive their form from the product integral                               
                   representation of multivariate survival functions in                      
                   neighborhoods contiguous to the hypothesis of                             
                   exchangeability. The aim of the project is to develop                     
                   asymptotic properties of these tests.                                     
                                                                                             
              (2)  Resampling methods in estimation and prediction from                      
                   Markov renewal processes:  we examine two different                       
                   resampling methods in estimation of the renewal matrix                    
                   from a censored Markov renewal process and apply them                     
                   towards setting confidence and prediction intervals.                      
                                                                                             
              (3)  L-estimation in the accelerated failure time model: we                    
                   develop an extension of L-estimates in a semiparametric                   
                   linear regression model with censored and truncated                       
                   data.                                                                     
                                                                                             
                   The aim of the project is to develop new inference                        
                   methods in models designed for statistical analysis of                    
                   data arising in application to areas such as medicine,                    
                   econometrics and astronomy.  Three interrelated topics                    
                   will be considered and will deal with testing                             
                   hypotheses, estimation and prediction based on                            
                   incomplete data.
