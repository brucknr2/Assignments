Abstract    :
              9310546  Cerling   This proposal is to study the carbon isotopic composition of
              fossil tooth   enamel to determine the diet of mammals in the last 20 million
              years. C4 plants   are isotopically different from C3 plants. Therefore, this
              study will determine the   timing of development of C4 ecosystems, which are
              usually dominated by   grasses. The proposed research has three parts: 1) to
              identify diagenic changes   that may alter the isotopic concentration of tooth
              enamel, 2) to precisely   determine the time that C4 ecosystems developed on
              several continents, and 3)   to establish the variability of diet in horses of
              North America. Based on   preliminary data, the apparent synchronous
              development of C4 ecosystems in   the Old and New Worlds suggests a global
              ecological change, perhaps related   to changes in atmospheric changes in CO2.
              This research will establish the time   of the first significant appearance of
              C4-dominated ecosystems on different   continents. Specifically, fossil horses
              from North America, Europe, Asia, and   Africa will be studied.   %%%  This
              research represents the first attempt to document the development of  
              grassland ecosystems worldwide. Given that these C4 ecosystems developed  
              simultaneously on different continents, then their evolution is most likely
              closely   tied to global ecological change. Understanding such changes and
              their   consequences is vital to predicting and preparing for future changes as
                atmospheric CO2 levels continue to rise.  ***
