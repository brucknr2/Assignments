Abstract    :
              9310755  Veziroglu    Description:  This project supports a second  "U.S.-India
              Symposium-Workshop on Remote  Sensing Fundamentals and Applications", to be 
              held in Bombay, India, in late 1994.  The first  meeting was held in March
              1985, and, since  then, major developments have taken place in  the field of
              remote sensing.  Sessions planned  include: design and development of active
              and  passive, surface airborne and spacecraft remote  sensing systems;
              satellite receptions and data  processing; remote sensing data processing; 
              data archiving and retrieval; meteorological  and hydrological applications;
              agricultural and  forestry applications; oceanographic, fishing  and
              aquaculture applications; land use and  geographic applications; geology and
              mineral  resources; remote sensing applied to energy and  fuels problems;
              pollution and waste heat  monitoring; remote sensing for the commercial  and
              private sector; government's role in remote  sensing; space shuttle remote
              systems and  results; and remote sensing education.    Scope:  The proposed
              meeting will be open to  scientists from many countries in South Asia  and the
              Middle East, in addition to the main  participants from India and the U.S.  The
                lecture texts of the invited lecturers will  be published before the
              Symposium-Workshop.   The Workshop reports will be published as one  volume
              after the meeting and will be made  available to interested organizations in
              the  U.S. and India and to the participants.  ***
