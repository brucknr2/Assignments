Abstract    :
              9310420 Roth          The award is for the purchase of motorized gimbal mounts,
              motion controllers, and other optical devices, to upgrade an existing four beam
              laser tracking measuring machine into a more accurate, self calibrating system
              capable of measuring positions and orientations of targets.  The equipment will
              be used in several research projects including, (1) Computer Numerical Control
              machine tool calibration, (2) serial robot calibration, (3) Stewart platform
              calibration, and (4) self calibration and control of laser tracking coordinate
              measurement system.          The research, when co pled, will make calibration
              of robots and machine tools easier and less expensive to perform, and will
              simplify the maintenance of the calibration system.
