Abstract    :
              This award supports intermediate energy nuclear research carried               
              out by staff of the Nuclear Physics Laboratory at the University               
              of Illinois.  Activities are focused on the physics of nucleon                 
              and few-body nuclear structure and on the magnetic moment of the               
              muon.  Specifically, they involve measurements in five areas.                  
              First, there is the electron scattering program at the Bates/MIT               
              accelerator that will try to determine if the proton is spherical              
              or ellipsoidal.  Second, there is a program of parity-                         
              nonconserving electron scattering at the Bates/MIT and the CEBAF               
              accelerators that will try to measure new aspects of the                       
              structure of the proton and neutron.  Third, there is the                      
              experiment to measure the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon                
              at Brookhaven National Laboratory.  Fourth, there are experiments              
              involving proton-antiproton collisions at the Low Energy                       
              Antiproton Ring at CERN.  These experiments search for new,                    
              exotic forms of nuclear matter, such as glueballs.  And fifth,                 
              there are experiments using beams of photons at the Saskatchewan               
              Accelerator Laboratory.  These seek to study certain aspects of                
              the structure of protons and neutrons as well as their                         
              interactions in light nuclei.  All of these experiments address                
              issues in intermediate energy nuclear physics that are at the                  
              forefront of our knowledge.
