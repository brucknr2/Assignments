Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                   This  is  an award under the Career Advancement  Award                   
              program  for women scientists and engineers.  It is a  study                   
              of class conflict over American education at the turn of the                   
              century.   The award will enable the researcher to  reorient                   
              her  work toward qualitative and archival work on the social                   
              influences on American education.  The project will  examine                   
              a variety of newspaper, archival, and other sources in order                   
              to  identify  the contending groups trying to influence  the                   
              direction  of American education in several regions  between                   
              1880  and  1920.   The  project  is  designed  to  test  the                   
              hypothesis  that only those social groups that can  draw  on                   
              pre-existing organizations can translate their interests and                   
              claims into changes in the educational system.                                 
                   This project will contribute important new perspectives                   
              on the social roots of the politics that shaped the American                   
              educational system in the twentieth century.  In addition to                   
              the  scientific  gains to be achieved by the research,  this                   
              award will materially assist a very capable young researcher                   
              prepare  for  a more broad-ranging research career,  thereby                   
              contributing  to the strengthening of the national  base  of                   
              women scientists and engineers.
