Abstract    :
                          9310551  Eckelbarger  The Darling Marine Center is the marine
              laboratory of the  University of Maine System.  Strategically located on the
              Gulf of  Maine, the Center offers unparalleled research and teaching 
              opportunities for resident and visiting faculty and students who  require ready
              access to a wide variety of inshore and subtidal  habitats including salt
              marshes, beaches, seagrass beds, soft  bottoms of all grain size types, and
              rocky hard bottoms.  Over  the last two years, the University has made an
              unprecedented  financial commitment to modernize the facility and to expand 
              teaching and research programs to benefit both University and  visiting faculty
              and researchers.  During 1992, additional lab  and office space was created for
              visiting scientists, two-thirds  of the existing buildings were renovated or
              improved, visitor  housing was increased by 65%, a new dining wall was built, a
               shoreside Dive & Field Staging Building was constructed, a small  wet
              classroom was created, a new boat was added to the research  fleet, and the
              research library was expanded.  In 1993, the  number of summer courses and
              workshops offered will be doubled  over 1992 and a unique Marine Biodiversity
              Program will be  inaugurated to begin building a biological database.  In the
              fall  1993, a newly created "Semester-by-the-Sea" program will be  initiated
              for UM undergraduates.  Because the Center has  experienced an abrupt upturn in
              use by resident and visiting  faculty, the University requests funds to
              construct a small  shoreside Visiting Investigator Lab/Classroom building to
              help  reduce crowding and to efficiently consolidate all teaching and  visiting
              investigator activities near the waterfront.  The  building would contain: 1)
              day lab/office space for summer  visitors that can be converted to a classroom
              during the academic  year, 2) a running seawater lab, 3) a small voucher
              specimen  museum, and 4) a chemical/radioactive tracer lab.  ***
