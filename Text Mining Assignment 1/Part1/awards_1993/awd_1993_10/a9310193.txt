Abstract    :
              9310193  Land    This project will develop, estimate, and evaluate hierarchical 
              linear models for several datasets on criminal victimization, thus  taking into
              account the implicit hierarchical structure of  victimization survey data -
              from individuals to neighborhoods to  cities or urban areas.  This approach
              will integrate and compare  the two major theoretical approaches to
              victimization: 1) the  routine activities/crime opportunity approach that
              stresses  individual-level covariates such as age, sex, and life style 
              characteristics, and 2) other approaches that emphasize  characteristics of
              aggregate units, such as neighborhoods and  cities.  The research will address
              critical criminological and  sociological issues that have been at issue in the
              assessment of  variations in victimization rates.    The research will improve
              scientific understanding of the factors  that put people at risk of being the
              victims of crime.  In so doing  it will demonstrate the power of new techniques
              of statistical  analysis, thus encouraging social scientists in several fields
              to  use them.  Knowledge of the factors that affect the risk of being  a victim
              of crime will be useful in reducing that risk.    ***
