Abstract    :
               The proposed research is in the area of ``machine learning,`  with  an emphasis
              on the development of efficient algorithms of both  practical  and theoretical
              interest.  The problems investigated include:  (a) learning in the presence of
              noise  (searching for   learning linear-threshold and parity functions in   
              the presence of classification noise, and `hypothesis  boosting` is possible in
              the presence of classification noise);   (b) exploration with obstacles  
              (developing efficient algorithms for  exploring planar regions  with obstacles
              and/or planar graphs, with a view towards integrating these  algorithms in
              larger  navigation systems);   (c) coordinating experts/feature  selection 
              (developing effective methods of combining the advice of a  variety  of
              experts/features for a given problem);   (d) autonomous learning of causal 
              structures (exploring how active learning can  effectively learn a complex 
              environment, such as a Macintosh  window system);   (e) new models of active
              learning  (refining the  understanding of the power and limitations of
              `membership  queries` for learning); (f) learning and biology (looking at a   
              variety of inference problems motivated by problems in   molecular biology);
              and (g) teaching in different  learning models (focusing on  algorithms for
              `effective teaching`).
