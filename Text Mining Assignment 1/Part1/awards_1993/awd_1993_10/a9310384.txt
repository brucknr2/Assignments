Abstract    :
                9310384  Dryhurst    This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation
              Program will assist the Department of Chemistry at the University of Oklahoma
              in the purchase of  an x-ray diffractometer and an associated data analysis
              system. This new instrumentation will enhance greatly research in a number of 
              areas including the following:    1)  Structure and reactivity of metal-CO2
              complexes and stereoselective synthesis with chiral (propargylium)Co2(CO)5
              complexes,    2)  Approaches to catalytic asymmetric allylic oxidation,    3) 
              C3-symmetric tripodal phosphine ligands,    4)  Ligands that impose chiral
              electronic environment about metal centers,    5)  Design and synthesis of
              chiral organometallic compounds for applications in asymmetric catalysis,    6)
               Synthesis, stabilization and application of reactive organic species:  metal
              stabilized quinodi-methanes, cyclophane monomers for cyclopolymerization, and
              electrically conducting organic and organometallic complexes,    7)  Fast-ion
              or super-ionic materials.    %%%  The x-ray diffractometer is used to make
              accurate and precise measurements of the full three-dimensional structure of a
              molecule.  The information obtained gives the precise values of all the bond
              distances and bond angles of  a given molecule and it gives accurate
              information about the spatial arrangement of  that molecule relative to the
              neighboring molecules.  ***           s  t
