              of Engineering at Purdue University will purchase optical spectrum analyzer and
              optical fiber fusion splicer equipment which will be dedicated to supp ort
              research in engineering.  The equipment will be used for several research
              projects, including in particular: (1) Research on High Speed Local Area
              Networks Using Ultrashort Light Pulses.  This project seeks to demonstrate the
              viability of a novel technique for multiplexing together data and other
              information over high speed local area (and metropolitan area) networks based
              on a new method for manipulation of ultrashort light pulses.  This technique
              could reduce electronic processing requirements and simplify procedures for
              network control for application such as interconnections between supercomputers
              and multimedia networking. (2) Research on Holographic Information Storage and
              Access Using Ultrashort Light Pulses.  This project aims at using specially
              encoded, ultrafast light signals for parallel information storage in volume
              holographic memories.  This project could contribute tot improved utilization
              and simplified operation of holographic data storage systems with tremendous
              potential storage capacities. ************
