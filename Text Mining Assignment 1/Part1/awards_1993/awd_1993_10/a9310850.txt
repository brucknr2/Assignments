Abstract    :
                            9310850  Roberts  The rates of malate metabolism and transport in
              maize root tips  will be measured using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy
              in  combination with other biochemical techniques.  These processes  will be
              quantitated in tissue exhibiting different rates of malate  synthesis, in
              response to potassium ion uptake, or assimilation of  ammonium ion.  Specific
              reactions that will be monitored include  (i) utilization of
              glycolytically-derived malate by mitochondria  for oxidation; (ii) action of
              PEP carboxylase and malic enzyme, and  their coordination with activity in the
              Krebs cycle and amino acid  biosynthesis; (iii) movement of malate between
              cytoplasm and  vacuole.  The combined measurements will permit observation of 
              interactions between the different components comprising malate  metabolism. 
              This information is a prerequisite to an understanding  of respiration, mineral
              nutrition, intracellular pH regulation,  amino acid biosynthesis and growth -
              particularly with respect to  the integration of these processes in vivo.  ***
