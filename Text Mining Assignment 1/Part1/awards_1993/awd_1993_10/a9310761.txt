Abstract    :
                  9310761  Stivala  Since oxidation adversely affects the mechanical behavior
              of  polymeric materials, the proposed study will add to our  understanding the
              theoretical basis of the mechano-chemical  degradation process.  This study
              will provide the basis in  establishing the thermodynamic relationship for the
              mechano-  chemical degradative process in terms of the chemical potential,  the
              driving force responsible for the phenomena.  In the ultimate  analysis, an
              indepth understanding of the transition from ductile  to brittle failure
              resulting from a molecular process (i.e., stress  accelerated oxidation) would
              be afforded.  ***
