Abstract    :
              9310369  FEATHERMAN       Since 1989, the Committee for Research on Global 
              Environmental Change of the Social Science Research Council  (SSRC) has
              facilitated research and training on human-  environmental interactions that
              are at least continental in scale  and that occur over time periods ranging
              from decades to  centuries.  Among the committee's accomplishments are
              development  of three major interdisciplinary research projects that involve 
              eighty researchers from around the world, sponsorship of  workshops and other
              gatherings to stimulate research, and  development of plans for training
              institutes and fellowships.  This renewal award continues support for core
              operations for the  committee for three additional years.  Among the activities
              to be  undertaken by the committee over that period are continued  catalytic
              development of major international, interdisciplinary  research projects,
              exploration of a variety of ways to foster  interdisciplinary research
              training, and sponsorship of the first  regularly scheduled meeting of
              researchers examining the human  dimensions of global environmental change,
              tentatively scheduled  for October 1994.       Through continued operation of
              the SSRC Committee for  Research on Global Environmental Change, major
              interdisciplinary  research and training activities designed to attract more 
              scientists to the study of longer-term, wide-ranging human-  environmental
              interactions will continue.  Special emphasis on  expansion of outreach
              activities during the next three years  should increase the number of scholars
              who benefit directly  through participation in committee-sponsored activities
              and  indirectly through the advancement of research on this important  topic.
