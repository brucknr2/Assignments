Abstract    :
              This dissertation project is a study of the co-management of the               
              Porcupine Caribou Herd in Canada. The focus of the research is on              
              community involvement in co-management decision making and its                 
              relationship to the sustainability of human-caribou relations.                 
              Shared Native-government authority in resource management is                   
              addressed with common property theory and the sociology of                     
              organizational democracy. This dissertation will study how the                 
              implementation of co-management has changed decision making at                 
              the community level, what factors influence community involvement              
              and management outcomes, and how community members evaluate their              
              involvement. Methods for data collection include participant                   
              observation, semi-structured interviews and the analysis of                    
              community documents.
