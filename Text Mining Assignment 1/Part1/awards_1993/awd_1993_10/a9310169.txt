Abstract    :
              This project is to provide financial support for the 6th                       
              International Conference on Structural Safety and Reliability                  
              (ICOSSAR '93) to be held in Innsbruck, Austria on August 9-13,                 
              1993.  The ICOSSAR conferences are international in participation              
              and significance and also cover all technological areas with                   
              regard to problems of structural safety and reliability.  The                  
              forthcoming conference will emphasize simulation, system                       
              identification, and the implementation and application of                      
              reliability-based design and analysis.  This is expected to help               
              establish methods of mitigating the potential loss of property,                
              human life and societal productivity arising from the functional               
              and physical failure of civil infrastructure and other critical                
              engineering systems under service usage as well as due to                      
              multiple natural and man-made hazards.
