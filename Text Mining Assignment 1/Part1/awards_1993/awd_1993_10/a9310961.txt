Abstract    :
              9310961  GARDNER      The U.S. JGOFS Arabian Sea Process Study affords an
              opportunity to  study the role of particles aggregates in oceanic biochemistry.
                Drs. Gardner, Walsh, and Richardson will study the distribution, 
              transformations, and characteristics of particulates and aggregates  in the
              Arabian Sea during and between the annual monsoons in an  effort to understand
              the relation between environmental conditions  and particles/aggregates
              dynamics.  Production, destruction,  interconversion, and sedimentation of
              particulates of various sizes  are important processes in oceanic
              biogeochemistry and will be  studied on spatial (vertical and horizontal) and
              temporal (diel to  seasonal) scales.  This study will contribute to our
              understanding  of the relationship between particles and aggregates of
              particles  in the water column, and in combination with other physical, 
              chemical, and biological measurements will improve our  understanding of
              oceanic biogeochemical cycling.
