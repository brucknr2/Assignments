Abstract    :
              9310184  Wasserman    The investigator will continue the development of
              statistical  methodology for social networks.  The focus of this project is to 
              integrate and merge the statistical and algebraic analyses of  multirelational
              networks, and to develop statistical models for  complete and local networks. 
              Data will be analyzed from  egocentered or local networks.  This type of data
              is rarely  analyzed extensively because of a lack of appropriate methods and 
              models.  The investigator will work to construct statistical  relational
              algebras to model complex relational structures using  logistic regressions. 
              %%%  The research will provide a statistically sound approach to  estimating,
              from data, the magnitude and relative importance of  dyad-dependent effects in
              real networks.  The tools developed  will be useful for understanding
              wide-ranging problems in fields  (i.e., epidemiology, social work, social and
              community  psychology, anthropology and sociology) where either behavior or 
              evolutionary dynamics depend on the pattern of contact between  individual
              actors.  ***
