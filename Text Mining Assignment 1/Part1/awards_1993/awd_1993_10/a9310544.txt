Abstract    :
              Farouk  9310544       The study addresses the fundamental mechanisms affecting
              the  deposition of diamond-like carbon (DLC) films by the plasma  assisted
              chemical vapor (PACVD) process.  The study will combine  state-of-the-art
              experimental techniques and detailed numerical  modeling of the process. 
              Successful completion of the research  will lead to the development of
              effective synthesis and  characterization of DLC films produced by the PACVD
              process.  A  primary objective of the project is to develop a commercially 
              viable coating process for depositing stress-free diamond-like thin  films with
              a high process reproducibility on various substrates.   Experimental
              investigations will include in-situ monitoring and  control of the PACVD
              processes in a reactor.  An advanced in-situ  monitoring instrumentation
              package will be used to measure the key  physico-chemical parameters of the
              plasma and the properties,  stoichiometry and the stress in the film. 
              Comprehensive numerical  modeling of the process will include the consideration
              and  interaction of the electron kinetics in the reactor, plasma  chemistry of
              a methane based deposition system and surface  reactions that affect the
              deposition process.       The extensive measurement capabilities will provide
              an  adequate data base for the validation and improvement of the model.   Using
              the diagnostic capabilities and the detailed numerical model,  a set of robust
              process parameters will be developed for scaled up  industrial reactors for DLC
              film deposition.
