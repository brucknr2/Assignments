Abstract    :
              9310624  Ereshefsky  Linneaus developed his system of classifying animals and
              plants to  accord with the biological theory of his day, namely a theory based 
              on creationism and essentialism.  Linneaus assumed that God created  an initial
              pair of organisms for each species and after God's  original creation no new
              species could arise.  Contemporary  biology, of course, does not contain such
              tenets.  The source of  species is not God but evolution through natural
              selection and  various other biological processes.  Despite the abandonment of 
              Linneaus' biological assumptions, the Linnaean System is still the  preferred
              framework for constructing classifications of the organic  world.  However,
              with the advent of evolutionary theory, the  Linnaean System faces numerous
              problems that undermine its  effectiveness.  The Linnaean System has lost its
              theoretical basis  and has become both cumbersome and ontologically vacuous. 
              Yet,  there is currently no thorough study of the problems confronting  the
              Linnaean System.  Dr. Ereshefsky, under this grant, is  providing just such a
              study.  Another aim for Dr. Ereshefsky is to  investigate an alternative
              taxonomic system, namely Willi Hennig's  1969 numerical system.  Preliminary
              work indicates that Hennig's  system can overcome many of the problems facing
              the Linnaean  System.  ***
