Abstract    :
              The purpose of this project is to develop empirically based,                   
              general equilibrium models of the monetary transmission                        
              mechanism, and use them to evaluate the desirability of                        
              alternative monetary policies.  The research consists of five                  
              parts.  The first develops a monetary model of the aggregate                   
              economy and proposes to investigate its implications for the                   
              proper conduct of monetary policy.  In the second part, the model              
              will be estimated with a broad set of financial data.  The third               
              part involves building a richer intermediate financial sector                  
              based on findings from parts one and two.  The fourth part of the              
              research well entail the investigation of the small sample                     
              properties of the statistical tools that will be used for model                
              evaluation.  The final part of the study will investigate the                  
              potential for seasonal demand shocks to the economy to help                    
              account for features of the business cycle.  The conventional                  
              view is that seasonal shocks are irrelevant, and thus it is                    
              appropriate to use seasonally adjusted data for model estimation.              
              This project is important because it will provide a better                     
              understanding of the interrelationships between monetary policy                
              and the business cycle.
