                  The Yuanaqu Basin is an intermontane structure                            
              covering about                                                                 
              350 sq. km within the Zhongtiao Range of central China.

              fossiliferous deposits were discovered in 1916 by a

              Tertiary vertebrates of China.  Since this early

              paleontologists have visited this basin and collected                          
              fossil

              20 taxa

              to retrieve fossils from these sites and characterize the

              The significance of this project is that it offers the
