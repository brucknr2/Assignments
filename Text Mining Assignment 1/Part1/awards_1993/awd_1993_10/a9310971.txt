              Semiconductor Optoelectronic Devices  This award will enable Dr. Richard Sahara
              to conduct collaborative research with Drs. Osamu Wada and Shigenobu Yamakoshi
              for 24 months at Fujitsu Laboratories, Ltd., in Atsugi, Japan.  The team will
              experiment with Dr. Sahara's designs of ultra fast electro optic sampling
              systems in order to improve the performance of compound semiconductor
              optoelectronic devices.  Optoelectronic devices, because of their high speed
              and compatibility with electronic systems, are a common frontier in information
              transfer for both communication and computer systems.  Optoelectronic
              modulators have already been integrated with distributed feedback laser diodes
              (DFBLDs) to produce components for communication systems that will allow
              shorter pulses to travel longer distances without degrading.  Some fabrication
              and design techniques developed for DFBLDs can be transferred to the relatively
              undeveloped technology of vert ical cavity service emitting lasers (VCSELs)
              that have the potential to transfer even larger amounts of information at even
              faster speeds.  The Ministry of International Trade and Industry of Japan
              (MITI) has targeted VCSELs as a key technology for the future and are
              encouraging Fujitsu as well as other Japanese electronic corporations to
              conduct research in this field.  Drs. Wada and Yamakoshi of Fujitsu are world
              leaders in DFBLD technology who are developing new compounds and designs to
              improve DFBLDs and who are turning to VCSELs as their next project as Fujitsu
              commercially develops DFBLDs.  Sahara's experience in subpicosecond pulse
              generation using DFBLDs fits well with the expertise and research goals of Wada
              and Yamakoshi.  A 24 month stay at Fujitsu will allow Sahara to gain not only
              first hand experience at a research laboratory of a major Japanese electronics
              producer, but also leading edge knowledge of VSCELs, commercially competitive
              optoelectronic devices of the future.
