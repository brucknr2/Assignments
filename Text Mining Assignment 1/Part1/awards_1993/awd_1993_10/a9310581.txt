                        9310581 Gurney  Sprouting occurs from undamaged motor neurons as a
              consequence of partial denervation or paralysis of muscle.  Muscle is thought
              to produce the stimulus for sprouting.  This project seeks to identify the
              molecular nature of that stimulus.  The following working hypotheses will be
              tested:  (1) sprouting is regulated directly by ciliary neurotrophic factor
              (CNTF) released from denervated or paralyzed muscle; and (2) sprouting is
              regulated by a soluble component of the CNTF receptor released from denervated
              or paralyzed muscle.  The assumptions of the model are that CNTF from a
              nonmuscle source is continuously available to motor neuron terminals, that the
              amount of  CNTF available is not sufficient to induce sprouting, and that when
              CNTF is presented as a complex with a soluble component of the CNTF receptor,
              its activity is potentiated and reaches the threshold for inducing terminal
              sprouting.  Dr. Gurney will test the two working hypotheses by using a
              combination of molecular and biological assays to determine the effects of CNTF
              and CNTFR components on sprouting.  In addition, monoclonal or polyclonal
              antibodies will be used to inhibit the biological activity of endogenous CNTF
              or soluble components of the CNTFR.  The most interesting implications of this
              study are that the motor neuron growth factor is not a entity and that
              different growth factors may regulate programmed cell death, synapse
              elimination, and regeneration or sprouting. ***
