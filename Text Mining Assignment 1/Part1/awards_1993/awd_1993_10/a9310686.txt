Abstract    :
              9310686  DYMOND      A variety of inorganic and organic chemical substances
              generated in  upper ocean may be considered indicators of the biological and 
              environmental conditions existing at the time of their formation.   In this
              study, the principal investigators will analyze a suite of   organic and
              inorganic bioindicator substances accumulating in  sediment traps deployed
              during the Arabian Sea Process Study. By  analyzing trap material in time
              series and comparing it to the  chemical composition of seafloor sediments, the
              investigators  expect to identify reliable biomarkers generated during monsoon-
               associated primary production events that (1) reflect water column  primary
              productivity and processes affecting primary production and  (2) persist in
              seafloor sediments as potential palenvironmental  indicators.
