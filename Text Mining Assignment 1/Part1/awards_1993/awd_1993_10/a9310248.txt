Abstract    :
              9310248   Philander       This award provides funds for graduate research
              assistantships   under the Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences Program at
              Princeton  University.  This Program represents the academic component of a 
              very successful collaboration between NOAA's Geophysical Fluid  Dynamics
              Laboratory (GFDL) and Princeton University's Geological  and Geophysics
              Sciences Department.  Some of the GFDL scientists  teach some of the courses in
              the AOS Program and serve as the  advisors to the students under this award. 
              The students have  access to GFDL's computational facilities.  Students'
              disseration  topics cover a variety of challenging problems related to weather 
              and climate, such as interdecadal variation of climate (using a  coupled
              ocean-atmosphere model), representation of cloud dynamics  in numerical models,
              and the dynamics of monsoonal circulations.       The student program is highly
              competitive and has produced  many excellent scientists who are among the
              leaders in the field  today.  ***
