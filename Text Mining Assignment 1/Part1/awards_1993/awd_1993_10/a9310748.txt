Abstract    :
              This award provides partial support for the Fifth International                
              Conference on Arabidopsis Research to be held at the Ohio State                
              University, Columbus, Ohio, on August 19-22, 1993.  The aim is to              
              provide an opportunity for researchers to exchange ideas on all                
              aspects of Arabidopsis research, including genome-related efforts.             
              The conference will include sessions on embryo, vegetative and                 
              reproductive development, cell differentiation, phytohormone,s                 
              photobiology, metabolism, pathogen and strews interactions, gene               
              regulation, genome research, and new technologies.                             
                                                                                             
              This is the first international Arabidopsis conference to be held              
              since 1990 and the number of researcher using Arabidopsis as an                
              experimental system has been growing at a tremendous rate.  Thus,              
              it is timely to hold this conference at this time.  The conference             
              is designed to maximize participation of young scientist and                   
              provide an opportunity for graduate students, postdoctoral                     
              students, and established investigators to exchange research                   
              results and ideas on the full range of topics that are being                   
              investigated in this important model system.
