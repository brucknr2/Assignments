Abstract    :
              9310732  Liu  The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the
              University of Arizona will purchase video, radio frequency (RF), and fiber
              optics equipment to facilitate research on video and multimedia communications.
               The equipment to be purchased includes: spectrum analyzers, bit error rate
              (BER) testset, video frame grabber and editor, and computers.  The equipment
              will be used for research projects including (1) multimedia acquisition and
              interface, (2) video processing, (3) video transmission performance evaluation,
              (4) transmission processing in subcarrier multiplexing (SCM), (5) interaction
              studies on high speed networking and multimedia processing, and (6) multimedia
              processing design and optimization.  These research projects will build the
              important knowledge base for video and multimedia communications.  As a result,
              we can develop cost-effective video and multimedia services to significantly
              enhance national education and research.  ***
