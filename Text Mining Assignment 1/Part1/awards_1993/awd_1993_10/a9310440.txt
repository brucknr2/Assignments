              Sudarshan The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the
              University of South Carolina will purchase the wideband tunable laser optical
              spectrometer system requested in this proposal which will be used in the
              continuing support of a large number of projects in the high field materials
              laboratory.  The main interests of this laboratory include high voltage
              electrical insulation, high field properties of photoconductive materials, and
              switching of high currents at high voltages for applications in pulsed power
              and power distribution environments.  The specific projects in which the
              requested equipment will be used include investigations into photoconductive
              properties of the next generation electronic materials such as epitaxial
              polycrystalline Diamond and single crystal silicon carbide films, the high
              power switching properties of Si and GaAs at high voltages, and surface defect
              characterization of large bandgap         ? p     materials such as A1   2   O 
               3   , SiO   2   , and poly diamond films, which are excellent electrical
              insulating materials. ***
