Abstract    :
              This research is to study the problem of obtaining an accurate  description of
              the probabilistic behavior of sums of dependent  random variables.  Essential
              tools for the proposed work will be  recent results in the area of decoupling
              inequalities.  A  decoupling inequality transforms problems on sums of
              dependent  random variables to problems on sums of conditionally independent 
              random variables.  In the proposed work, particular attention  will be focused
              on developing tail probability approximations for  randomly stopped sums,
              quadratic forms of independent random  variables, and the general problem of
              sums of arbitrarily  dependent random variables.  This research is to study
              some important problems in probability  theory.  In particular, the
              investigator will look at the  behavior of sums of dependent observations. 
              These sums will be  studied by comparing them to appropriate sums of
              independent  observations.
