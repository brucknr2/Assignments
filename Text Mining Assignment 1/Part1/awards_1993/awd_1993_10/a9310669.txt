Abstract    :
                9310669  Boulanger  This action is to assist in the purchase by the Department
               of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of  California,
              Davis, of an Automated Testing System and  interface hardware, to be dedicated
              to support research in  engineering.   It is a computer-automated control
              system  that can immediately extend the capabilities and performance  of many
              civil engineering testing systems.    When installed, it will be immediately
              utilized for research  projects in geotechnical earthquake engineering.  ***
