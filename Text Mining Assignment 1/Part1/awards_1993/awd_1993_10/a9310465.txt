Abstract    :
              9310465  van Leer  The work proposed here is to develop an efficient explicit, 
              unstructured Navier-Stokes solver for a parallel-processing  environment, based
              on these ideas.  An implicit solver would be  developed as well, so that the
              trade-offs between explicit and  implicit unstructured Navier-Stokes solvers on
              parallel  architectures could be studied.  The end result of the research 
              would be an extremely efficient three-dimensional Navier-Stokes  for
              unstructured grids on a parallel architecture.
