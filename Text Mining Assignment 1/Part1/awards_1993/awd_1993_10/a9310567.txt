Abstract    :
              9310567  Islam  The possibility and properties of solitons in semiconductor wave
              guides will be studied theoretically and experimentally.  Solitons arise in
              optical fibers due to the balance between group-velocity dispersion and the
              nonlinearity, and they are interesting because they are self-trapped, robust
              pulses that act in many ways like particles or fundamental data bits.  Just as
              solitons are valuable for long distance telecommunications and all optical
              switching in fibers, solitons in semiconductors will be important for
              integrated optics and compact, integrable, all-optical switches.  Using
              solitons in integrated optics can obviate the need for low-dispersion
              strip-line structures, which are being studied for short pulse propagation. 
              Recently, major advances have been made in ultrafast switching and networks
              using solitons in optical fibers.    Two approaches will be pursued to
              demonstrate semiconductor solitons.  First, semiconductor waveguides will be
              used below half of the energy gap to avoid effects from two-photon absorption. 
              The nonlinearity below half-gap will be balanced by the dispersion from a
              periodic, corrugated surface, producing so-called  "gap solitons".  In a second
              approach, the  nonlinearity can be enhanced by nearly three orders-of-magnitude
              by using a resonant nonlinearity at the transparency point in a semiconductor
              amplifier.  Calculations show the feasibility of demonstrating a soliton by
              balancing the resonant nonlinearity with the material group-velocity dispersion
              near band gap, and current injection is used to counter both linear and
              nonlinear absorption.  ***
