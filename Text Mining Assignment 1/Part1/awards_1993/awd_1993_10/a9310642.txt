Abstract    :
              9310642  Rinaldi    This research deals with studies on the application of
              novel,  recently developed nuclear magnetic resonance techniques to polymer 
              structure characterization problems.  Simple problems concerning  polymer
              modification chemistry and copolymerization chemistry will  be explored
              initially to allow the nuclear magnetic resonance  techniques to be perfected
              and to provide experience in their  application.  Later, more complex problems
              will be investigated.   The studies will be conducted by Professor Peter
              Rinaldi whose  specialty is nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and
              Professor  H. James Harwood jointly whose specialty is in synthesizing 
              polymers and applying chemical and physical techniques to problems  of polymer
              microstructure characterization.  New nuclear magnetic  resonance techniques
              developed in Professor Rinaldl's laboratory  will permit selective observation
              of structurally important polymer  fragments, and will permit extraction of
              long-range structural  information not previously obtainable by other means. 
              These  techniques are ideally suited for polymer characterization studies  that
              require the detection of labeled nuclei that are present in  low concentration
              in these polymers.    It is expected that these studies will bring forth new
              information  on detailed polymer structure as a function of polymerization  
              method.  ***
