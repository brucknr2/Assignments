Abstract    :
              9310221  Everett    This project is a three-year investigation into the
              morphosyntactic and phonological systems of the Arawan languages, with special
              focus on Banaw .  It will involve approximately ten months of field work in the
              Amazon, with six months on Banaw  and two months each on Zuruah  and Deni. 
              Texts and lexica will be collected and transcribed in each of these villages
              and further analyzed and processed by the PI both in Brazil and at his home
              institution.  Descriptive and theoretical articles on Banaw  phonology and
              morphosyntax will be submitted within the first two years of the project,
              followed by a detailed grammar of Banaw  to be produced by the end of the final
              year.  The work on Banaw  will serve as the touchstone for further grammatical
              description of Zuruah  and Deni and analysis of unresolved grammatical problems
              in the remaining Arawan languages, Madij , Paumari, Yarawara, and Yamamadi. 
              These studies will enable us to document and describe the basic features of the
              entire Arawan family, representing the first major study of an entire Amazonian
              family not of the Tupi or Ge phyla.  Moreover, initial studies of these
              languages by the PI have already shown them to be of great theoretical interest
              for morphological, syntactic, and phonological theories.  Also, this study will
              include the reconstruction of Proto-Arawan leading, it is hoped to the eventual
              genetic classification of this entire family.  Finally, since Arawan languages
              are all endangered, this study will also provide an irreplaceable source of
              information and perhaps stimulate outside interest in the survival of the
              languages and the pe ople who speak them.             '|                   '|
