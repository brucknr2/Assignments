Abstract    :
              Liang  9310152      This is a three-year cooperative research project for
              developing a  chip load servo system to improve machining product tolerance, 
              surface finish, and machine use by Dr. Steven Liang, George  Institute of
              Technology and Professor H. T. Young, National Taiwan  University.  The
              objective of this project is to establish  cooperative research between the
              U.S. and Taiwan in precision  machining and machine tool technology.  This
              project will involve  the major U.S. machine tool companies, GM, Ford, and the
              Torrington  Company, as well as Taiwan machine tool companies.  Dr. Liang has 
              an excellent track record in this field of research.  The success  of this
              project can improve the control of product dimensional  accuracy  and surface
              finish and can enhance precision machining  technology.  This study is jointly
              supported by the NSF and the  Taiwan National Science Council.  The
              Manufacturing Processes and  Equipment Program has provided $20,000 to jointly
              support this  project.
