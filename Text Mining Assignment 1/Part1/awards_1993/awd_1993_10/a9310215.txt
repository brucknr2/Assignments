Abstract    :
              The purpose of this grant is for continued support for research                
              on the nature and implications of establishment-level employment               
              and wage dynamics.  The various components of this project rely                
              heavily on the use of the Longitudinal Research Database as a                  
              rich source of establishment-level data for U.S. manufacturing                 
              industries.  Three lines of research are pursued in this project.              
                                                                                             
              The first uses quarterly and annual time series data, that the                 
              investigators have constructed on gross job creation and                       
              destruction, to investigate the driving forces behind business                 
              cycles.  The second line of research involves the development and              
              analysis of public domain time series data on gross investment                 
              flows, by detailed sector and plant characteristic.  The third                 
              involves the development of theories to investigate the positive               
              and welfare implications of the connection between job creation                
              and destruction and the business cycle.  This research is                      
              important because it will enhance our understanding of wage and                
              employment changes at the level of the firm, and it will also                  
              provide new insights as to how these changes affect and are                    
              affected by the business cycle.
