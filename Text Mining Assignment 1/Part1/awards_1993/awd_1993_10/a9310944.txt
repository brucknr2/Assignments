Abstract    :
              9310944  Drzal  The purpose of this Research Equipment Grant Award is to allow
              the  purchase of an Environmental Scanning Electron Microscope (ESEM) by  the
              Composite Materials and Structures Center at Michigan State  University.  This
              device will be used to perform processing and  durability research in polymer,
              cement and ceramic matrix  composites in order to increase their use on the
              durable goods  industry.  Studies will include investigations of the failure of
               composites under combined thermal, mechanical and moisture  environments.
