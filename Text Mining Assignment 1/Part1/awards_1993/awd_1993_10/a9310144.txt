Abstract    :
              9310144  Witt    This proposal is for the organization and conduct of the 9th 
              American Conference on Crystal Growth (ACCG-9) to be held in  Baltimore, MD on
              August 1-6, 1993.   The conference will  examine all aspects of bulk and thin
              film crystal growth,  with particular emphasis placed on crystal growth 
              fundamentals, optical materials thin film epitaxy, bulk  growth, and novel
              materials and techniques.  Participants  are to come from many countries around
              the world.    %%%    This project is for the organization and conduct of the
              9th  American Conference on Crystal Growth (ACCG-9) to be held in  Baltimore,
              MD on August 1-6, 1993.  The conference will  examine all aspects of bulk and
              thin film crystal growth.  Experts from institutions around the world will
              attend this  conference.  Exchange of information at the conference will 
              enhance understanding of the crystal growth theories and  practices.    ****
