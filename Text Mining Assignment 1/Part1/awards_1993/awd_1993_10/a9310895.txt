Abstract    :
              GOYET  9310895    The principal investigator will share with another
              collaborating  scientist the task of making core measurements of the seawater 
              carbon dioxide-carbonate system during the pelagic processes  cruises of the
              Arabian Sea Process Study.  Two of four measurements  total dissolved inorganic
              carbon, the partial pressure of carbon  dioxide (pCO2), total alkalinity, and
              the pH -- are necessary for  characterizing the entire carbonate equilibrium
              system. On some  occassions, however, full sets of measurements will be made to
               "overdetermine" the system as a check on internal consistency.   Both
              atmospheric and surface water pCO2 will be measured  continuously along the
              cruise track.  This kind of information is  fundamental to understanding carbon
              dioxide dynamics at the level  of sea-air exchange and on a global scale.
