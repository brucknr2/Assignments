Abstract    :
              9310972  Sohn  Japan CGP Program:  Parallelization and Implementation of
              Production Systems on the EM 4 Data Flow Multiprocessor  This award will enable
              Dr. Andrew Sohn of the New Jersey Institute of Technology to conduct
              collaborative research with Dr. Kenji Nishida for three months at the Computer
              Science Division of the Electrotechnical Laboratory in Tsukuba, Japan.  The
              team will investigate parallelism in production systems and implement a
              parallelized system on the EM 4 data flow multiprocessor.  The Japanese
              Ministry of Industrial Trade and Industry currently funds a large multi
              institute project to develop a parallel processing computer system.  As part of
              this project, the Electrotechnical Laboratory has designed and constructed four
              generations of experimental data flow multiprocessing machines.  The fourth
              generation machine, EM 4, is comprised of 80 processors and is currently being
              tested by Dr. Nishida to determine whether it can effectively and quickly
              execute large and realistic problems.  Utilizing Dr. Sohn's expertise in non
              numeric problems such as production system interpreters, Nishida and Sohn will
              parallelize two types of production systems, partition and assign the functions
              and data of those production systems to the mulitprocessor, and execute the
              systems.  The team will evaluate the performance of the EM 4 and determine any
              improvements which would be needed to perform full scale real problems on the
              multiprocessor.
