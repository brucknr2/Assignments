Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Why are the two sexes different?  The simple answer is steroid                 
              hormones.  Steroid hormones stimulate cell growth, sexual                      
              differentiation, and also trigger the expression of sex-typical                
              behaviors.  One of their most important targets is the brain.                  
              Until recently, it was thought that steroids exerted their                     
              effects directly on gene expression by binding to receptors in                 
              the cell nucleus.  It has recently become clear that steroids act              
              through nongenomic mechanisms as well.  These recent findings may              
              necessitate a "paradigm shift" in the way research into                        
              reproduction is conducted because it seems that the mechanisms of              
              steroid action are much more complicated than previously thought.              
              At large scientific meetings, practitioners of various                         
              disciplines tend to interact with each other and do not                        
              necessarily become exposed to fast breaking developments that,                 
              although relevant to their work, involve unfamiliar methods and                
              expertise.  The purpose of this conference is to bring molecular               
              investigators together with behavioral neuroscientists to promote              
              collaborations that can capitalize on recent advances in our                   
              understanding of the mechanism of steroid hormone action.
