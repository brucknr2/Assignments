Abstract    :
                  9310491  Meyer  The Department of civil Engineering and Engineering
              Mechanics at  Columbia University will purchase and MTS Model 490 control
              system,  together with a compatible software system and a Compact Deskpro 
              Personal Computer, to upgrade an MTS 810 universal testing machine.   A series
              of experimental studies is planned to investigate the  durability of concrete
              materials and structural components damaged  by freeze-thaw cycles,
              alkali-silica reaction, salt-water attack,  and other environmental effects,
              which are among the causes for the  deterioration of our nation's
              infrastructure systems.  In addition,  the Laboratory is the central
              experimental research facility of our  Center for Infrastructure Studies.  It
              is expected to play a major  role in testing materials and structural
              components within a  variety of different research projects to be defined by
              the  consortium of seven universities affiliated with the proposed  Center.
