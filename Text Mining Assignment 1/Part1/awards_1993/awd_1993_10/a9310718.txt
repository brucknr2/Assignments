Abstract    :
              9310718  Xu  The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the
              University of Texas at Austin will upgrade and purchase computers and antenna
              array system equipment which will be dedicated to supporting research in
              engineering.  The equipment will be used for several research projects,
              including in particular: control and performance analysis of high-speed
              telecommunication networks, smart antenna system for wireless communications,
              high-resolution direction finding, blind equalization, and channel propagation
              measurement.  ***
