Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  In response to a petition made to the National Research                   
              Council's Committee on Atmospheric Chemistry to establish an                   
              institution aimed at recent or expectant Ph.D. recipients on the               
              threshold of independent research careers in atmospheric chemistry,            
              the PIs have organized the second in a series of colloquia designed            
              to introduce these young scientists and their thesis and/or post               
              doctoral research to one another and to representatives of the                 
              major funding agencies involved in atmospheric chemistry and                   
              closely related topics.  The PIs have organized a meeting to be                
              held at Harvard in Cambridge, 18-19 June 1993 in conjunction with              
              the 1993 Gordon Research Conference on Atmospheric Chemistry to be             
              held in Newport, RI 21-25 June 1993.  In addition to the young                 
              scientists, representatives from NSF, NOAA, NASA and DOE will                  
              participate in this colloquium.
