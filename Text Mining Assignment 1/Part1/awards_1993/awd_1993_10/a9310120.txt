Abstract    :
                   This award covers experimental Elementary Particle Physics                
              Research by a group at Vanderbilt University in collaboration                  
              with other NSF and DOE supported scientists.  The group will                   
              continue studying polarized e+e- interactions as members of the                
              Stanford Large Detector (SLD) collaboration at the Stanford                    
              Linear Collider (SLC).  They are also actively planning                        
              experiments and building prototype detectors for experimentation               
              with the GEM collaboration at the Superconducting Super Collider               
              (SSC).
