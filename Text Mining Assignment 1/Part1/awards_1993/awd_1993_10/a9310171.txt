Abstract    :
              9310171  Croat and Zhu       Graduate student Zhu under the supervision of Dr.
              Croat is  undertaking a taxonomic study of tropical aroids of the genus 
              Dracontium, of which there are an estimated 20 species in the New  World
              tropics.  Materials for study include preserved herbarium  specimens borrowed
              from various national and international museums  and supplemented with new
              field collections to be made in Costa  Rica, Venezuela, and Ecuador with the
              help of host country  colleagues.  New features of morphology and anatomy
              including  pollen and chromosomes are being analyzed, to acquire reliable 
              characters for taxonomic discrimination and for construction of a  stable
              classification of the species.  Field observations on  pollination will help
              understand the differences in floral form  among the species.  %%%      
              Numerous groups of tropical plants are poorly known, often  from single or few
              collections made decades ago by various natural  history expeditions.  This
              doctoral thesis project will focus on  the New World species of a group of
              tuberous aroids related to  philodendrons and anthuriums, and will result in
              greatly increased  collections available for morphological and biochemical
              studies, as  well as improved methods of species recognition, a more stable 
              classification, and the first analysis of phylogenetic  relationships among
              these species and with putatively related  genera.
