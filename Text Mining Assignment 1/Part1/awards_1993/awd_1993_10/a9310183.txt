Abstract    :
              This grant provides partial support research in the study of  interactions of
              protons with antiprotons at 1800 GeV energy at  the Fermilab Tevatron colliding
              beams accelerator complex.  Interaction products will be observed in the CDF
              detector  operated by a large international collaboration that includes the 
              Purdue group.  The particular activity is participation in R&D  directed toward
              the design and construction and installation in  CDF of a silicon vertex
              detector with enhanced capability.  Sophisticated diagnostic instruments will
              be purchased to outfit  a silicon-detector laboratory.  The new vertex detector
              will aid  in identification of B-meson decay products of Top quarks, whose 
              discovery is the subject of intense interest.
