Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will maintain the system to provide the Subcommittee              
              of Federal Oceanographic Fleet Coordination (SFOFC) with a                     
              comprehensive, up-to-date and searchable database of research ship             
              schedules.  The system will be available on-line over computer                 
              networks and a twice-yearly hardcopy will be distributed.  The                 
              system will optimize the planning and scheduling of research ship              
              time by the participating agencies.  It will also provide a ship               
              characteristics database to allow users to find ships in the                   
              database that fit their scientific requirements.
