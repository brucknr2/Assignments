                       9310936 Shapiro With this project, the Oregon Institute of Marine
              Biology will improve its seawater system.  The facility has undergone a recent
              expansion, resulting in a doubling of resident faculty.  The number of active
              research programs has tripled, and an additional new faculty position will
              begin in September 1993.  The expansion has also resulted in an increased use
              of the present seawater system, along with increased need for reliability in
              support of funded research programs.  Specifically, the plan is to improve the
              seawater intake system, construct a second pumping system to be placed in
              parallel with the existing system, duplicate the piping from pump to  storage
              tanks, provide a back up air compressor system, and provide a monitoring and
              alarm system.  The improvements were designed with redundancy, serviceability,
              and performance as prime criteria, and should result in a much increased level
              of security for on going research programs.  The workplan is excellent.  The
              facility is growing at a rapid rate in terms of productive research use. 
              Research projects supported by the facility are significant to modern
              understanding and management of marine resources as well as to fields of basic
              biology. ***
