Abstract    :
              9310528  Kundu  A variable frequency, 10 to 100 MHz, acoustic microscope
              (Olympus  UH-Pulse 100) will be purchased.  The immediate application of this 
              equipment will be in the detection of dangerous "kissing" and  "slip" bonds at
              the adhesively bonded interfaces.
