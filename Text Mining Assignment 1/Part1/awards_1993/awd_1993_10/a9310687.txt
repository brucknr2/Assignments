Abstract    :
              9310687  Roman         A major goal of the U.S. JGOFS Arabian Sea Process  Study
              is to examine the role of this region in global  biogeochemical fluxes,
              particularly in sequestering carbon  below the pycnocline.  Mesozooplankton are
              important in this  process because they consume suspended material and 
              facilitate its removal from surface waters by the production  of rapidly
              sinking (> 200 m d-1) fecal pellets.  Because of  this enhancement of the
              vertical flux of biogenic material,  mesozooplankton research is a "core" area
              of JGOFS.       Dr. Roman will conduct measurements of mesozooplankton 
              biomass, grazing and fecal pellet production in the Arabian  Sea Program. The 
              research goal is to determine the role of  mesozooplankton in biogenic flux in
              the Arabian Sea.  The  research objectives are to: (1) estimate the biomass (C,
              N)  of different size classes of mesozooplankton (64-2000 um) in  the Arabian
              Sea and to determine how this biomass is  vertically and horizontally
              distributed; (2) estimate the  consumption of photosynthetically fixed carbon
              by different  size classes of mesozooplankton; (3) estimate the  consumption of
              heterotrophic carbon (ciliates and  flagellates) by different size classes of
              mesozooplankton;  (4) estimate the potential rates of carbon and nitrogen 
              export in the form of fecal pellets by different size  classes of
              mesozooplankton; (5) determine the effect of  suboxic waters on mesozooplankton
              biomass and grazing.
