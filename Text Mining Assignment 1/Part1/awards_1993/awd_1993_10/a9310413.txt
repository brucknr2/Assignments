Abstract    :
              9310413  Pazzani       The objective of the proposed research are to investigate
              the  utility of algorithms that learn probabilistic relational concepts  from
              noisy, relational data, concentrating on algorithms that  perform
              classification using evidence combination.  Of particular  interest is the
              potential improvement in classification accuracy  that can be obtained if the
              reliability of rules is taken into  account.  An additional objective is to
              extend noise-tolerant  learning algorithms to take advantage of incomplete or
              uncertain  knowledge of the concept to be learned.  Such knowledge may be 
              expressed as a partially incorrect or incomplete domain theory.   These
              algorithms will be tested on a number of data sets from the  UCI Repository of
              Machine Learning data sets and on three new  relational data sets involving
              spinal injury identification,  mineral spectra identification, and oil spill
              analysis.  In  addition, they will be tested on a number of synthetic domains, 
              where variation of parameters will allow insight into the general  behavior of
              these algorithms.  The system HYDRA                     (Ali & Pazzani, 1993),
              which has already shown some promise on a  limited number of data sets will be
              significantly extended for  these investigations.
