Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Carbocationic polymerizations are used extensively in large                    
              volume industrial processes (for example, butyl rubbers and                    
              isobutylene-based industries).  These polymerizations are                      
              commonly carried out in toxic chlorinated hydrocarbon                          
              solvents, many thousands of pounds of which end up yearly in                   
              the atmosphere.  This project is an investigation into the                     
              possibility of replacing these polluting solvents with the                     
              environmentally neutral, inexpensive carbon dioxide as the                     
              all-purpose solvents for Friedel-Crafts acids mediated                         
              polymerizations, and beyond these, to Friedel-Crafts acid                      
              catalyzed reactions in general.                                                
                                                                                             
              The first specific thrust will be the demonstration that the                   
              toxic solvents can be replaced with supercritical carbon                       
              dioxide in carbocationic polymerizations and                                   
              copolymerizations, and to elucidate the scope and fundamentals                 
              of these processes.  This will be followed by explorations                     
              into Friedel-Crafts acid catalyzed reactions, such as                          
              alkylation, sulfonation, acetylation, etc.  The effects of                     
              pressure, temperature, and reagent concentrations in                           
              supercritical carbon dioxide will be explored.  The initial                    
              phase of the polymerization studies will concern common                        
              monomers (isobutylene, styrene and its derivatives, and                        
              conjugated dienes such as isoprene), coinitiators, and small                   
              amounts of additives (cosolvents, proton traps, electron                       
              donors, and salts).
