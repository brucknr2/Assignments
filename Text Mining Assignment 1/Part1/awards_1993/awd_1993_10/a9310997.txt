Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT -- CTS-9310997  PI -- Costas P. Grigoropoulos    The Department of
              Mechanical Engineering at the University of California at Berkeley will
              purchase an In-situ Spectroscopic Ellipsometer equipment which will be
              dedicated to support research in engineering.  Ellipsometric measurements yield
              the optical properties of bulk and thin film materials, over a wide spectral
              range and up to high temperatures.  The equipment will be used for several
              research projects, including in particular:  (1) "Thermal Phenomena in Thin
              Films," Research on the investigation of radiative and thermal transport in
              thin film structures.  (2) "Heat Transfer in Excimer Laser Materials Processing
              and Micro-machining," Research on the investigation of pulsed laser techniques
              for thin film fabrication and micro-machining.  (3) "Pulsed Laser Removal of
              Small Particles from Solid Surfaces," Research on the investigation of rapid
              phase change transformations at the nanosecond time scale.
