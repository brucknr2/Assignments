Abstract    :
              9310767  Vitousek  The loss of biological diversity if the most permanent of the
              many global consequences of an expanding human population and level of
              activity.  To what extent does this loss of diversity lead to changes in the
              functioning of ecosystems?  Twenty and more years ago, the ecological community
              thought we knew the answer to this question-diversity leads to ecosystem
              stability, and its loss therefore should de stabilize ecosystems.  However, at
              that time our understanding of both diversity and ecosystem function were
              inadequate even to frame the question in a meaningful way.  %%%  The advances
              in ecology since (both in population biology and ecosystem studies) and the
              urgent need to understand the consequences of ongoing global changes in
              biological diversity have led the Scientific Committee on Problems of the
              Environment (SCOPE) to establish a 3-year project to evaluate a)what is known
              about connections between biological diversity and ecosystem function; and b)
              what research should be initiated  now so that we will  be able to understand
              and manage these connections in the future.  This proposal requests funding to
              support a workshop within the SCOPE program to evaluate biological diversity
              and ecosystems; the workshop will be held in mid-October, 1993, in the Bahamas.
                ibute to our understanding of the development of C4 ecosystems. Based on the
              excellent reviews, the Program agrees with this assessment, and recommend that
              this proposal be funded.    Panelist Beatty rated this proposal as "Fair." She
              believed that the research was very important and that the PI was highly
              qualified, but that the study w as much more "geol
