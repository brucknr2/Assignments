              are of central concern to American, British, French, and German anthropology
              since these networks are involved in the formation of basic social, political,
              and economic institutions.  With the collaborative development of mathematical
              anthropology here and on the continent the invesitgators will be able to: (1)
              complete of a set of user friendly c omputer programs for data entry and
              dynamic and static analyses of kinship and marriage networks; (2) start a
              crosscultural data base of kinship networks; and (3) participate in series of
              colloborative workshops, funded, in part by the German Humboldt Foundation,
              where major European and US researchers will solve basic methodological and
              theoretical issues in network analysis applied to kinship problems.  The
              approach is comprehensive in its potential for representing and analyzing a
              great variety of kinship structures and related processes, and focuses on
              scientific studies of social order and change, involving new methods of
              discrete structural analysis and graphic techniques of resenting data and
              findings. ***   #    x   \        P    C      X P#
