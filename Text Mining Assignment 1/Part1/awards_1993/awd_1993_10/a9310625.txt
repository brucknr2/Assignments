Abstract    :
              9310625  QUINN  This project has two purposes.  The first is to develop a 
              systematic comparative measure of international financial  regulation among
              developed nations.  The second is to understand  why nations change laws to
              liberalize or restrict their  international current accounts.  The project is
              important because  no comparative measure of financial openness is available. 
              The  development of the global financial market is one of the most  significant
              events of the postwar world economy, and its domestic  and international
              sources are poorly understood.    The project will begin with the coding of the
              International  Monetary Fund's Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and
              Exchange  Restrictions.  Each country's laws regarding financial  movements
              will be evaluated and scored.  The resulting measure of  financial openness
              will be reported descriptively, and then  examined in explanatory pooled,
              cross-section, times series models.  ***
