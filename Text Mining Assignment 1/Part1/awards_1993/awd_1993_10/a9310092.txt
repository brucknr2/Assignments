Abstract    :
              This grant in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program is                  
              in the area of mass spectrometry of biomolecules.  Professor                   
              Lebrilla and his students will use an external source Fourier                  
              transform mass spectrometer, FTMS, to measure gas-phase                        
              basicities of protonated biomolecules.  Semi-empirical                         
              molecular orbital calculations will be used to determine the                   
              sites of protonation in oligosaccharides.  In addition,                        
              hydrogen/deuterium exchange reactions with chiral alcohols will                
              be used to determine the exact configuration of different                      
              exchange sites on the oligosaccharides.  The goal of the                       
              proposed research is to increase our understanding of                          
              intramolecular interactions and proton migration pathways in                   
              gas-phase biomolecules.

              Professor Lebrilla proposes to use Fourier transform mass                      
              spectrometry to elucidate the structure of gas-phase                           
              biomolecules.  The research involves mass spectrometry,                        
              molecular orbital calculations and hydrogen/deuterium exchange                 
              reactions.
