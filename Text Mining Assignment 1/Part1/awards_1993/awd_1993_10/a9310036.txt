Abstract    :
              9310036  Beissinger    This research extends our understanding of nationalist
              mobilization  through an empirical investigation of the wave of mass unrest
              that  engulfed the former USSR during the glasnost'period.  A unique set  of
              event-level data on thousands of demonstrations, strikes, and  mass violent
              events in the former Soviet Union to be completed  during this research will
              explore the role played by the dynamics  of political change and political
              opportunities in structuring  national consciousness and ethnic mobilization. 
              The data are the  only systematic and detailed record of mass protest activity
              in the  former USSR currently in existence.  Building on previous research, 
              the project uses this unique set of data to provide new insights  into the
              glasnost'protest cycle, as well as to explore the ways in  which politics acts
              to structure ethnic identitites and ethnic  political action.    Unlike
              traditional approaches to the study of nationalist  mobilization, this study
              takes the political arena itself as a key  factor in determining the nature and
              intensity of ethnic mass  action.  In particular, the project focuses on the
              effects of  political liberalization, elite conflict and turnover, governmental
               coercion, and electoral competition on ethnic mobilization and  conflict. 
              Data gathered on these factors are used to explore their  roles in triggering
              waves of ethnic mobilization and in shaping the  character of protest.
