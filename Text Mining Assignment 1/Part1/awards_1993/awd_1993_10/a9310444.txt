Abstract    :
              9310444  Whang       This research is to study the transition of slow shocks in
              the  solar wind to fast shocks in interplanetary space and the non-  planar
              magnetic reconnection associated with 3D slow shocks.  Large  disturbance in
              the solar wind propagate as magnetohydrodynamic  (MHD) shocks through
              interplanetary space.  Near the corona, these  shocks can be slow shocks, but
              most likely they appear as fast  shocks by the time they reach Earth.  This
              study is to carry out  simulations in the physical space to verify the
              transition of slow  shocks to fast shocks.  The study uses a compressible model
              for  non-planar reconnection associated with conical slow shocks.  The  primary
              objective is to understand the reconnection of non-planar  field lines
              associated with curved shock surfaces.  The project  will systematically study
              solutions under different combinations of  controlling parameters to identify
              the quantitative relationships.  ***
