Abstract    :
              9310693  Caron         Pico-sized organisms (organisms 0.2 - 2.0um) constitute 
              a very significant portion of the production and living  biomass of oceanic
              plankton communities.  Primary production  by photosynthetic microorganisms in
              these size classes  (cyanobacteria, prochlorophytes, some small eukaryotic 
              algae) are major contributors to total primary production in  the plankton. 
              Likewise, recent evidence suggests that  bacteria may be the largest single
              repository of living  biomass in many pelagic ecosystems.  Collectively, the 
              activities and fates of these assemblages strongly influence  the flow of
              energy and biologically reactive elements in the  ocean.  Because these
              assemblages are generally smaller than  the particles captured efficiently by
              metazoan zooplankton,  the repackaging of these microorganisms into larger 
              consumers is a fundamental step for their incorporation into  pelagic food
              webs.  Protistan consumers in the nanoplankton  size range (largely flagellated
              protozoa ~20 um in size)  play a pivotal role in plankton communities as the
              primary  consumers of picoplankton assemblages (both bacteria and 
              phototrophs).  Yet, there is still little information on the  rates of
              consumption of bacteria and small phytoplankton in  oceanic environments, or on
              the growth and production rates  of protistan consumers.  As a part of the U.S.
              Joint Global  Ocean Flux Study in the Arabian Sea, Dr. Caron will perform 
              experiments to investigate the grazing rates and production  of nanoplanktonic
              consumers from the surface waters and O2  minimum layer of this oceanic
              environment.  The overall goal  in this work is to quantify carbon flow through
              the first  trophic interaction in the microbial plankton.
