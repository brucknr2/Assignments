Abstract    :
              9310810  Ranker    This research project will address three questions central to
              understanding the evolution of the rare orchid, Spiranthes diluvialis, and
              ensuring the future existence of this threatened species 1) What is the
              phylogenetic or genealogical history of  S. diluvialis?  2) What is the genetic
              structure and variation within and among populations of  S. diluvialis? and, 3)
              What is the interplay between life history stages and environmental conditions
              and how do these parameters impact the continued existence of  S. diluvialis?  
               %%%  This research will provide information critical to formulation of
              conservation management plans for S. diluvialis as well as data on the basic
              biology and evolution of this threatened species.  This study is the first to
              explore the origin of a polyploid species (a species with more than two sets of
              chromosomes) in the Orchidaceae through the application of molecular
              techniques.  The research will provide information regarding the possible
              allopolyploid origin (via hybridization of two genetically distinct diploid
              species) of S. diluvialis and its distinctness as a species.  Electrophoretic
              data will allow identification of the putative parental taxa and provide
              insight into the genetic variability present within the genus.  Knowledge of
              the evolutionary origin of S. diluvialis will provide a meaningful framework
              for and insight into both genetic and ecological studies critical to the
              continued existence of this rare orchid.  ***
