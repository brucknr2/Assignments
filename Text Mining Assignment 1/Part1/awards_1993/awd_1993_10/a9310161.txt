Abstract    :
              9310161  Walker    This workshop entitled "International Workshop on Advances in
              the  Modeling of Aerodynamic Flows" will be held in Poland July 12-14,  1993. 
              It will bring together approximately forty scientists from  the former Soviet
              Union and forty from Europe and the USA to   discuss the latest advances in the
              modeling of aerodynamic flows.  One of the main objectives of the workshop is
              to initiate and  foster scientific collaborations between scientists in Russia
              and  the West in this field.      This project fulfills the program objectives
              of advancing  scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the U.S. and 
              Russia to combine complementary efforts and capabilities in areas  of strong
              mutual interest and competence on the basis of  equality, reciprocity, and
              mutuality of benefit.
