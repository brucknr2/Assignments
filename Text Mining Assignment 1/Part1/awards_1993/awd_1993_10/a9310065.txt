Abstract    :
              9310065  Scroggs    The brain receives input about the environment from signals 
              coming in through  the sensory systems.  The brain also has  mechanisms that
              modulate those  afferent input systems, and  one example of such phenomena is
              the suppression  of pain  signals during emergencies that activate the "fight
              or flight"  responses.   Suppression of pain information may be achieved  by
              nerve cells in the brain  releasing neurotransmitters such  as serotonin and
              norepinephrine to bathe cells  down in the  spinal cord where the nerves enter
              that carry pain  information.  It is  not understood how these substances may 
              selectively inhibit pain without also  inhibiting other  important sensory
              inputs that use the same transmitter   molecules.  This work uses anatomical
              tracing techniques to  identify the source  of input (skin, joints, muscles)
              and the  central targets in the spinal cord of single  neurons, and 
              electrophysiology and pharmacology to determine how the   important
              transmembrane channels in these identified  individual nerve cells are 
              affected by these transmitters.   Discovery of how various types of sensory 
              neurons have  differential sensitivity to these two neurotransmitters will 
              advance  our understanding of how the brain controls its own  input, and so
              will have an  impact on all sensory  neuroscience, in addition to providing a
              basis for potential   applications toward developing medicines with selective 
              effects on different  sensory pathways.  ***
