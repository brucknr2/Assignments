Abstract    :
                  9310833  Foster  The Harvard Forest is a 1300-hectare field station in
              central New  England.  In addition to the resident science and technical staff 
              of approximately 35, over 50 researchers from over a dozen  institutions
              conduct a major portion of their field studies at  the Harvard Forest.  In the
              area of education the Harvard Forest  activities include (1) serving as a host
              to 2-4 visiting faculty  annually through the Bullard Fellowship Program in
              Forest Biology  at Harvard University (2) sponsoring approximately 24 students 
              annually as summer research assistants to faculty and science  staff, (3)
              hosting more than 15 university courses for field  studies, (4) convening
              numerous state, national, and  international conferences in science and policy,
              and (5)  educating more than 5000 visitors annually in the Fisher Museum  of
              Forestry.  Research at the Harvard Forest is integrated around  the central
              theme of studying and dynamics of forest ecosystem as  affected by natural and
              human disturbance processes.    In recent years there have been much higher
              demands for  laboratory facilities, offices, and equipment in the areas of 
              biogeochemistry, atmosphere-biosphere interactions, and microbial  ecology. 
              Education-related demands on laboratory facilities have  risen as both graduate
              student research and undergraduate  research program have expanded.  Beyond the
              need for expanded and  improved laboratory facilities, there is the critical
              need to  archive soil and plant tissue samples in a systematic and orderly 
              fashion.  Currently, samples collected at Harvard Forest are  stored at various
              places.  None of these locations have adequate  archive facilities.  Valuable
              samples have been discarded simply  because storage space is unavailable.   
              The project will support the development of a multi-user nutrient  analysis and
              new offices in the current J.G. Torrey Laboratory  and to construct a
              soil/plant tissue archive facility.  Major  acquisitions will include CHNS
              Analyzer, balances, drying  ovens,  grinder, fume hoods, muffle furnace, pH
              meter, work benches, and  storage cabinets.  The nutrient analysis facility
              will create  1048 ft2) will provide storage and electronic cataloging for over 
              32,000 samples.
