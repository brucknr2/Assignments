Abstract    :
              9310634  GOWING    As part of the U.S. JGOF Arabian Sea Process Study (ASPS),
              this  study is aimed at understanding how changes in species composition  and
              abundance in the pelagic community of primary producers,  zooplankton grazers,
              and microheterotrophic decomposers impacts the  biochemical cycling of carbon
              in the Arabian Sea. Physical forcing  by the monsoon winds triggers seasonal
              burst of biological  productivity in this region.  As in other ecosystems, this
               production will involve a temporal succession of species of  producers,
              grazers, and decomposers-- each with differing  capacities to influence carbon
              production, respiration, physical  repackaging (e.g., shredding, fecal pellet
              production), and  transport--  and the PIs propose to follow these changes over
              time.   Therefore, while other investigators involved in the ASPS, will be 
              making relatively gross chemical measurements of the rates of  carbon
              production, mineralization, and transport, this study will  provide valuable
              insights into the actual contributions of specific  biophysical and ecological
              mechanisms accounting for those rates.
