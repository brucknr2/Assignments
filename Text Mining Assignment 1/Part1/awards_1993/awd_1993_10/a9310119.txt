Abstract    :
              9310119  Pfeffer        Drs. Pfeffer and Challa will continue their
              investigations  into the physical processes responsible for hurricane
              formation,  pursuing two major thrusts.  The role of environmental forcing in 
              the transformation to cloud clusters and depressions into  hurricanes will be
              explored using potential vorticity diagnostics  of model simulations. 
              Specifically, the PIs will look at the  relative important of upper level
              atmospheric waves and low level  wind surges in the hurricane genesis.  The
              other principal effort  will be to assess how the representation of boundary
              layer and  cumulus cloud processes affects simulations of hurricane 
              development through sensitivity studies with various  parameterization schemes.
               In addition, they use a coupled  atmosphere-ocean model to investigate how
              variations in thermocline  depth affects tropical cyclone development.  This
              research is an  important contribution to improving our ability to better
              predict  hurricane development and behavior.  ***
