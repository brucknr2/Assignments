Abstract    :
              9310633  Moyer  Science and technology are a part of culture.  They both shape
              and  are shaped by the society that creates them.  To understand  contemporary
              American society and American science, one must  understand its sources. 
              Joseph Henry, physicist, founding member  and president of the National Academy
              of Science, first Secretary  of the Smithsonian Institution, played a central
              role not only in  creating an American style of science, but also for creating
              the  major institutions that have nurtured the develop of science in  America. 
              Dr. Albert Moyer is undertaking a three year study of  Joseph Henry and his
              pivotal role in shaping the ideas and  institutions of American science.  He is
              also probing Henry's more  subtle impact on individuals and ideology in the
              United States  during a crucial, formative era--an era in which he came to 
              symbolize the ideal scientist and even "American science" itself.   Dr. Moyer's
              study also reveals how Henry himself was being shaped  by contemporary
              practices, interactions, and beliefs at home and  abroad.  In effect, this
              study is the story of the "invention" of  American science, to the extent that
              Henry helped forge a modern  vision of the scientist and science in American
              society.    ***
