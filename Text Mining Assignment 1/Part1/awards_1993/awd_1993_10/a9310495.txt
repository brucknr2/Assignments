Abstract    :
              9310495  Becker    The usual assumption in most discussions over time is that
              choices  today are not directly dependent on choices in the past.  The 
              assumption of independence is not "nonsense," for it usefully  simplifies many
              problems that are not crucially affected by  dependencies over time.  But the
              assumption has discouraged  economists from grappling with other issues of
              considerable  significance -- including addictions, work habits, preference 
              formation, why children support their elderly parents, preference  solutions to
              the problem of future commitments, and the evolution  and stability of
              institutions.    This project considers how a person's current preferences
              depend on  past experiences, and on the behavior of others.  The influence of 
              the past is illustrated by habitual behavior, defined as behavior  that
              displays a positive relation between the past and current  consumptions of a
              good, such as drugs.  The influence of others is  illustrated by peer pressure,
              which may induce a teenager to start  smoking.  In essence, therefore, the
              project will consider the  rational formation of preferences.  The process is
              "rational" in  the sense that a person is assumed to try to anticipate the 
              consequences for his future preferences of what he does now,  including groups
              with which he associates.  The assumption of  forward-looking and consistent
              behavior provides rules and  implications that determine how preferences evolve
              over time, and  in which groups.  This work tries to contribute to our
              knowledge of  these processes.    ***
