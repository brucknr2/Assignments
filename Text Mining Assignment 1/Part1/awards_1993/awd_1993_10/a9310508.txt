Abstract    :
                        9310508  Davies  Plants are confronted with potentially harmful
              environmental  factors such as insect attack, drought, heat, cold and UV 
              irradiation.  They have evolved strategies of accommodation,  whereby they can
              perceive and respond to such stimuli without them  resulting in death.  These
              strategies require integrated mechanisms  where stressful conditions
              experienced by one part of the plant  elicit responses in distant parts.  Some
              of these responses need to  be extremely rapid, and thus conventional
              explanations involving  manufacture and transport of diffusible chemicals
              (hormones) may  not be sufficient.    This proposal fcuses on two types of
              rapidly-generated and  transmitted signals which we have described recently in
              both  sunflower and tomato: action potentials (APs), which result from  the
              activity of voltage-sensitive (voltage-gated) ion channels; and  variation
              potentials (VPs), which are based on pressure-sensitive  (stretch-activated)
              ion channels and result from rapid changes in  the hydraulic condition of cells
              and tissues in proximity to the  xylem.  In the research proposed here, we will
              perform treatments  to selectively evoke or repress either or both of these
              electrical  signals in order to determine their role in modulating the 
              expression (up-regulation and down-regulation) of various genes.  ***
