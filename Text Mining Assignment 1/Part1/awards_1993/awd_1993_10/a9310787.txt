Abstract    :
              9310787  Plosser  The Carnegie-Rochester Conference on Public Policy is designed
              to   foster research and discussion of major policy issues by  economists from
              academia and policy making institutions.   Economists in universities are often
              unfamiliar with the  constraining effect of institutional arrangements in the
              shaping  of policy issues and policies and economists in government are  often
              less aware of current research and its implications.  A  central purpose of the
              conference is to provide the interaction  between these groups in order to
              improve the economic analysis of  policy issues and policy.    The specific
              aims of the conference are to: 1) develop the          implications of recent
              research for policy; 2) bring together       economists with different
              approaches or conclusions to narrow the   differences; and 3) to uncover the
              analysis used by institutions    that set policies.  The conferences are held
              semi-annually at the   University of Rochester and Carnegie Mellon University. 
              About 40   participants plus faculty and graduate students from the host      
              institutions are invited to each conference.  Participants from     U.S. and
              foreign central banks and U.S. and international  agencies attend regularly. 
              Special care is taken to involve  promising younger scholars.  The paper and
              formal discussions are  edited and prepared for publication to broaden the
              impact of the  conference.  ***
