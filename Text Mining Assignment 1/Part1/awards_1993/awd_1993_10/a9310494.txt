Abstract    :
              9310494  Choi    According to a widespread view, children initially map spatial
              words onto spatial concepts established through nonlinguistic sensorimotor
              development--for example, IN to a notion of  containment  and ON to notions of 
              contact  and  support.   If this cognitivist view is correct, the meanings
              children initially associate with spatial words should be similar regardless of
              input language.  The project will evaluate this hypothesis by comparing the
              meanings associated with spatial words by one- to three-and-a-half-year old
              children learning English, Dutch, and Korean, three languages that classify
              spatial relations in strikingly different ways.  Two cross-sectional studies
              are proposed.  In a production experiment, topological spatial action
              descriptions are elicited in a naturalistic setting with familiar objects.  In
              a comprehension study, sensitivity to language-specific topological
              distinctions are assessed with the "preferential looking paradigm", a technique
              that is minimally demanding and hence ideal for young children.  The data will
              be analyzed (1) to determine how early children develop language-specific
              principles of categorizing spatial actions, and (2) to assess, through analysis
              of correct and incorrect patterns of generalization, the relative difficulty
              for children of alternative principles of spatial classification.  The results
              will contribute toward a clearer picture of the interaction in early language
              development between children's nonlinguistic grasp of spatial relations and
              their sensitivity to the semantic categories of the input language.  5p0    6hC
