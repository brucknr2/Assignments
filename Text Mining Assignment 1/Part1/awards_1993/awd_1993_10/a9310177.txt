Abstract    :
              A conference will be held, part of a the Gordon Research                       
              Conference series, addressing issues of quantum-chromodynamics in              
              nuclear physics.  There will be both experimental talks and                    
              theoretical talks on subjects ranging from color transparency in               
              nucleon knockout to strange quark amplitudes in the nucleon to                 
              manifestation of QCD effects in relativistic heavy ion                         
              collisions.  The conference will be held in Tilton, New                        
              Hampshire, July 26-30, 1993.
