Abstract    :
              9310717  Johnson  This award provides partial support for participants to attend
              a  conference and discuss research ideas and results on the topic of  "Danger,
              Risk and Safety:  Ideas and Practices in Industrializing  Societies."  The
              conference will occur at the Hagley Museum and  Library in Wilmington,
              Delaware.  The Center for the History of  Business, Technology, and Society at
              the museum, and the Society  for the History of Technology and the American
              Association for  the History of Medicine are co-sponsoring the conference. 
              Penn  State Press has expressed interest in publishing the papers.  The 
              conference will bring together scholars from a variety of  backgrounds to share
              ideas about the historical construction of  the concept of risk and its current
              policy implications and to  consider directions for future research.  Despite
              increasing  social attention to questions of risk and safety, and changing 
              conceptions and expectations about social attempts to deal with  these dangers,
              the historical study of risk remains a relatively  neglected area of
              scholarship.  Isolation within historical  specializations of labor,
              technology, or occupational health  results in little in the way of synthetic
              overview of the topic.   This conference will help to forge connections between
              graduate  students and established scholars in a variety of these 
              specialities, and to create a richer and more focussed exchange  on these
              issues.  ***
