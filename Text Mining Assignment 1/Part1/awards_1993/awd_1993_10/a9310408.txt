Abstract    :
              9310408  Abraham-Shrauner  Analytic solutions for the evolution equation of the
              etched surface of a semiconductor are proposed as a exciting advance. 
              Calculations of the shape of the etching surface for both radical and
              ion-assisted etching in simple models are feasible in analytic form.  The
              specific model is for etching of a trench on  semiconductor such as silicon. 
              Lie group methods for finding the symmetries of nonlinear differential
              equations will be used to expand the possible class of analytic solutions. 
              These solutions will not only complement numerical simulations of etched
              surface evolution but in many cases will provide the user with easy expressions
              that can be quickly applied to the particular etching process.  The electric
              fields due to local charging, chiefly differential charging, will be calculated
              by finite element analysis with the computer program Maxwell.  The deflection
              of the ion trajectories by the local electric fields will be compared with
              another mechanism for the distortion, the exclusion of thermal ions with
              non-normal trajectories by the acceptance solid angle of the trench.  ***   v
