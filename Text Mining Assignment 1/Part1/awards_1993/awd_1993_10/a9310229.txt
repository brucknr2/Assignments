              9310229  Turner       This award provides partial support for the fifth and
              sixth  annual SUNYA Topology and Group Theory conferences, October  29-31,
              1993, and October 14-16, 1994, in Albany, New York.  The  conferences
              concentrate on combinatorial group theory and low  dimensional topology.  The
              invited speakers are Warren Dicks,  Mark Feighn, Frederic Paulin, Robion Kirby,
              Peter Kropholler, and  Zlil Sela for 1993 and will be of similar number and
              expertise  for 1994.  ***
