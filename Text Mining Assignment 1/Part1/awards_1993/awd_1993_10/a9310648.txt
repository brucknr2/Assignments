Abstract    :
              An REG award will support the acquisition of a surface force                   
              microscope of an advanced design and with a laser spectroscopy                 
              system attached.  The equipment will be used to study the                      
              fundamental nature of boundary lubrication films by making                     
              simultaneous measurements of the rheology of ultra-thin fluid                  
              films confined between two flat surfaces and the behavior of the               
              molecules at the surface, such as their orientation, relaxation                
              and mobility.
