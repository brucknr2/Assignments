Abstract    :
              It has been 40 years since the discovery of the double helix                   
              structure of DNA and it is appropriate for the 58th Cold Spring                
              Harbor Symposium of Quantitative Biology to have as its theme "DNA             
              and Chromosomes. The meeting will be held at Cold Spring Harbor                
              Laboratories from June 2,-June 9, 1993, bringing together                      
              approximately 350-450 scientists from around the world. The meeting            
              will bring together many of the leading investigators as well as a             
              significant number of younger scientists in a setting conducive to             
              intense discussion and interactions.

              The research discussed at this meeting will have an impact on all              
              areas of biology in many different organisms and experimental                  
              systems. Understanding the role of chromosome structure on DNA                 
              metabolism is at a critical stage and this meeting should help to              
              catalyze further advances.
