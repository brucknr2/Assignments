Abstract    :
              9310315   Fairweather   The goal of the proposed research is to develop
              effective parallel  sparse linear system solvers for solving the algebraic
              equations  arising in the finite element discretization of elliptic and 
              non-elliptic coupled systems of partial differential equations.   These solvers
              will be based on domain and subspace decomposition  methods for use in the
              solution of linear and nonlinear coupled  multicomponent problems, such as
              chemically reactive flows.  The  emphasis will be on scalable, transportable
              algorithms.
