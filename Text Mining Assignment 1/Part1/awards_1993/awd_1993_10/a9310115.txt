Abstract    :
              Ha         Four fault simulators and automatic test pattern generators  (ATPGs),
              produced in research projects at the Virginia  Polytechnic Institute, are being
              developed and enhanced so as to  bring them into a state for distribution to
              general users.  These  tools are:  1.     FSIM, combinational circuit fault
              simulator;  2.     HOPE, a synchronous sequential fault simulator;  3.    
              ATALANTA, an ATPG for stuck-at faults in combinational  circuits; and  4.    
              SOPRANO, an ATPG for stuck-open faults in combinational  circuits.
