Abstract    :
              9310852  Melloch  The School of Electrical Engineering at Purdue University will
              purchase a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) system that will be dedicated to
              support research in engineering.  The CVD system will be used for several
              projects related to research and development of silicon carbide (SiC) devices
              and integrated circuits.  Two SiC researchers in the School of Electrical
              Engineering at Purdue University are investigating, in which the CVD system wil
              play an important role, are development of SiC charge-coupled ultra-violet
              imager and a joint research effort with Cree Research, Inc. to develop a
              1024-bit non-volatile one-transistor random-access memory chip.  ***
