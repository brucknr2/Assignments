Abstract    :
              9310719  PELTZER      As part of the U.S. JGOFS effort to construct a model for
              carbon  cycling during the Arabian Sea Process Study, the principal 
              investigator will measure water column concentrations of dissolved  organic
              carbon (DOC) at depths of 0 to as much as 1000m at stations  extending from the
              western upwelling margin to the oligotrophic  center of the Arabian Sea.  By
              cooperating with another  investigator who will focus on DOC production and
              mineralization,  the dynamics of DOC during and between the monsoon seasons
              will be  investigated with the prospect of understanding how water column  DOC
              dynamics are related to episodes of monsoon-driven primary  production.
