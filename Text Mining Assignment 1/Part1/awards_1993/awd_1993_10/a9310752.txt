Abstract    :
              9310752  Yamada         The proposed laboratory plasma experiment is to analyze 
              magnetic reconnection from both local and global points of view  through
              studies of both microscale layers and global forcing and  magnetohydrodynamic
              (MHD) flows.  Two force-free spheromak plasmas  are prepared with a common
              axis, parallel toroidal currents, and  parallel or anti-parallel toroidal
              fields in the MRX (magnetic  reconnection experiment).  A Lundquist number of
              about 2000 is  expected and the plasma will be about 100 ion gyroradii in
              extent.   External coils exert force on the plasmas and alter their large- 
              scale configuration which, in turn, affects reconnection rates and  resultant
              MHD flows.  Diagnostics include magnetic and Langmuir  probes, spectroscopy,
              optical tomography, and visualization of  flows and topology.  The experimental
              results will most directly  affect theories of reconnection in the solar
              atmosphere and on the  basic physics of current sheets, reconnection flows, and
              non-  coplanar MHD shocks.  Simulations of MRX experiments will be  carried out
              with three-dimensional resistive MHD codes which are  also used for solar,
              astrophysical, and magnetospheric simulations,  thus providing important tests
              of such codes.  ***
