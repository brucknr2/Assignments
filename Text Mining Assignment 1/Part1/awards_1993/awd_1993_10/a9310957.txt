Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Biological diversity has been changing and continues to change in              
              nearly  all  habitats  on  earth and it  is  now  well-recognized              
              nationally and internationally that there is an urgent  need  for              
              research programs specifically on issues of biological diversity.              
              This  projects  supports  the  workshop  on  a  Special  Research              
              Initiative  on Marine Biological Diversity and Systematics.   The              
              objective of the workshop is to bring together leading biological              
              oceanographers and marine biologists to discuss whether there  is              
              an  urgent need for this program in Ocean Sciences and to  define              
              the nature and substance of such a program.  The ultimate goal is              
              to  include  this  research  in the  Long-Range  Plan  for  Ocean              
              Sciences.  Biological diversity, its causes,  and  the  potential              
              fragility  of  biotic  systems in the face of  knowledge  of  the              
              species comprising a system, and rigorous species identifications              
              require a healthy science of systematics.
