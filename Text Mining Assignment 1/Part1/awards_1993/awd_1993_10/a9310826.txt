                       9310826 Sherbrooke The Southwestern Research Station (SWRS) of the
              American Museum of Natural History (AMNH), located in southeastern Arizona,
              offers field biologists from numerous U. S. and international institutions a
              field research facility with access to a wide range of biological communities
              and a great diversity of species.  The primary objective of the Station
              research.  Support facilities for field research projects are extremely
              important.  This project addresses three areas of acute facilities' needs at
              SWRS in an integrated plan.  The first goal is to provide a climate controlled
              building for temporarily housing experimental animals in isolated units, for 
              different experimental/care needs.  This facility would meet room wing onto the
              laboratories to provide a winterized space for housing scientific collections
              and the research library.  In addition, the roofing of the entire laboratory
              would be insulated and refurbished.  The third goal is to renovate the outdated
              animal room into a computer room and an office.  Achieving these goals would,
              in addition, significantly increase space for researchers and improve
              conditions in the main laboratory facility. ***
