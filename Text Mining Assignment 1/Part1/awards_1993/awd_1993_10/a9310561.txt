Abstract    :
              9310561  Rynasiewicz  Recent work in the philosophy of space and time has
              increasingly  focused on the comparison of physical theories in coordinate-free
               formulations.  Such formulations have been given for a variety of 
              non-relativistic theories as well as for the usual array of  relativistic
              theories.  Nonetheless, certain doubts have been  expressed that there is a
              consistent coordinate-free formulation of  non-relativistic electrodynamics in
              which absolute space plays a  coherent and indispensable role.  The absence of
              such a formulation  is a significant lacuna since, historically,
              electrodynamics  precipitated the transition to relativity physics.  Dr. 
              Rynasiewicz' goal in this research is to fill this lacuna by  providing a
              coordinate-free formulation of the Maxwell-Lorentz  theory in Newtonian
              spacetime.   In doing this, he will provide  researchers with a new vantage
              point from which to address a number  of issues in the history and philosophy
              of physics.  One of these  is a rigorous assessment of the similarities and
              differences  between the theoretical strategies of Einstein and his
              predecessors  and contemporaries with respect to the optics and electrodynamics
               of moving bodies.  Another is the significance of the absolute-  relational
              controversy concerning the nature of space and time in  this critical episode
              in the history of physics.  These results are  of interest to philosophers,
              historians and physicists alike.  ***
