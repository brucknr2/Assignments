Abstract    :
              9310967  Drumheller    This proposal is a request to continue studies of the
              properties of  magnetism in less than three dimensions and to pursue unusual
              but  important aspects of superconductivity.  Magnetic systems in low- 
              dimensions are realized in nature by special arrangement of the  magnetic ions
              that make up the materials into planes or chains and  have wide industrial
              application as well as fundamental application  to other studies such as
              high-temperature superconductivity.  The  work focuses on the seldom studied
              critical properties of these  systems in the temperature range at which the
              materials transform  from non-magnetic compounds into low-dimensional magnetic
              systems.   Critical properties of high-temperature superconductors as well as 
              new fullerene-type molecules will also be studied.  ***
