Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Funded under an Engineering Research Equipment Grant, a CCD                    
              (Charged-Coupled Devices) camera will be added to the                          
              instrumentation capability of the Mechanical and Aerospace                     
              Engineering Department at the PI's institution. It will be                     
              used for several research projects, including in particular                    
              research on the turbulent structure of high Mach number shear                  
              and mixing layers.                                                             
                                                                                             
              The projects have relevance to propulsion of high speed                        
              vehicles, with impact on both efficiency and pollutant                         
              emission through improved understanding of turbulent mixing.
