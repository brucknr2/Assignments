Abstract    :
              9310617  Ferree    This is a study of public discourse on the issue of abortion
              in  Germany and the United States, examining how it shifted over the  past 30
              years.  The issue of abortion will be used to develop and  test a broader
              theory of public discourse and the conditions under  which social movements are
              likely to influence it.  The abortion  issue provides significant variation
              between countries and over  time on two major variables of interest: (a) the
              degree of  polarization reflected in mass media discourse and (b) the relative 
              influence of social movement actors compared to political parties  and other
              institutional actors in shaping it.  The primary methods  employed are content
              analysis of newspapers and other mass media  sources over time and a
              combination of content analysis and  informant interviews with spokespersons
              who have promoted a  particular interpretation or way of framing the abortion
              issue.   The research design will employ common research instruments and 
              cross-national teams in data collection.    This project will contribute
              significantly to scientific  understanding of how the mass media and social
              movements interact  to shape public perceptions of major social issues. 
              Because it  focuses on an important controversy that has developed quite 
              differently in Germany and the United States, it will contribute to  knowledge
              about the differences between these societies and provide  insights that will
              be valuable to policy-makers confronting future  disputes.    ***
