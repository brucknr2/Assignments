Abstract    :
              9310070  Alexander  This grant will fund research to develop composites for 
              biomedical applications.  The materials will consist of an  absorbable polymer
              reinforced with calcium phosphate based  fibers.  One of the goals of this
              research is to have the  composite degrade over a period of two years into near
              neutral  degradation products.  The investigators intend to test the 
              mechanical and chemical characteristics of the fibers, produce  the composites,
              and perform in vivo testing.    This research is important since it could lead
              to the development  of absorbable fracture fixation devices that will eliminate
              the  need for second surgeries to remove hardware.  Since the  materials should
              allow the gradual transfer of the load to the  healing bone, the need for
              stress shielding should be eliminated.  These materials should also be able to
              be used for the controlled  release of growth and differentiation factors to
              bone healing  sites.  ***
