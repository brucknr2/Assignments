Abstract    :
                  9310476  Aifantis  The work will explore the adaptation of recent methods of
              nonlinear  physics in interpreting a variety of plastic flow and fracture 
              phenomena exhibiting pattern formation and periodicity.  The  occurrence of
              dislocation patterns, regularly spaced shear or  rotational bands and cracks,
              periodic velocity profiles and step-  like crack growth in stick-slip fracture,
              are some of the examples  to be considered from a unifying point of view. 
              Emphasis will be  placed in providing qualitative explanations and quantitative
               models for problems that could not be addressed by using standard  approaches.
