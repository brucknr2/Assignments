Abstract    :
              9310093  Cook    This 3-year proposal is for funding to continue the development
              of  a continuous, absolutely-dated Holocene tree-ring chronology from  live
              Huon pine trees and sub-fossil logs collected in western  Tasmania, Australia. 
              Progress to date includes the development of  two absolutely-dated Huon pine
              annual tree-ring chronologies  extending back over 2,000 years from the present
              time, the  reconstruction of warm-season Tasmanian temperatures since 300 BC 
              from one of these series, the development of two floating, sub-  fossil
              tree-ring chronologies in the 4-6,000 years BP range, and  the excavation of
              105 new sub-fossil Huon pine logs from the  Stanley River flood plain. 
              Radiocarbon dates of six of these new  logs indicates ages of 4-7,000 yrs BP,
              plus two other logs with  dates in the 30,000 yrs BP range.  The latter two,
              each containing  several hundred rings, are among the oldest, well-preserved,
              sub-  fossil logs yet discovered  anywhere and are proof that recoverable  Huon
              pine wood from the last glacial epoch is present in Tasmania.   Consequently,
              the development of a continuous tree-ring chronology  extending back into the
              late-Pleistocene is a very real  possibility.  The bulk wood from this
              collection and the proposed  new collections will eventually be used for
              isotopic analyses and  the likely extension of the high-precision radiocarbon
              calibration  curve back into the last glacial epoch.  Over the next three
              years,  we will process the sub-fossil wood now in hand, extend the  existing
              tree-ring chronology back in time, and continue to collect  more sub-fossil
              Huon pine wood from area in western Tasmania.  In  Addition, we will develop
              new and extended climatic reconstructions  for Tasmania, including the probable
              extension of the warm-season  temperature reconstruction back to 2,000 BC.
