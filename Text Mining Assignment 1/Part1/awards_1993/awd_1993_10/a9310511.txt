Abstract    :
              9310511  Hall    The nervous system is composed of two major cell types, neurons
              and glia. Glial cells have many important roles that allow the neurons to
              function. Different types of glial cells have different functions and are
              needed in different parts of the nervous system.  Little is known about how the
              different glial cell types arise during development of the nervous system. This
              study will define how neurons alter glial cells during the development, and
              will establish the similarities and differences between two types of glial
              cells, those of nerves and those of ganglia. The hypothesis to be tested is
              that glial cell precursors divide and mature into either of these two types of
              glia in response to factors from the neurons.  A cell culture system has been
              developed that will allow this hypothesis to be tested. Information from these
              studies will lead to a greater understanding of how cell-cell interactions
              influence development in the normal nervous system.  ***
