Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This study will assess and investigate the determinants of 1970-               
              1990 trends in occupational sex and race segregation, and trends in            
              the sex and race composition of specific occupations.  The                     
              investigators have already created occupational-level data files               
              aggregated from individual-level 1970 and 1980 census microdata.               
              This project will create a similar file for 1990 that will permit              
              three-wave pooled cross-sectional time-series analysis.  The unit              
              of analysis is the detailed occupation.  The dependent variables               
              are changing proportions of various race-sex groups (e.g. black                
              women) across the more than 500 detailed occupations.  The                     
              independent variables measure occupational growth, attractiveness,             
              white male labor supply, the ability of their customary workers to             
              exclude outsiders, their economic pressures to lower costs,                    
              economic advantages to hiring nontraditional workers, and                      
              vulnerability to legal sanctions.                                              
                                                                                             
              The research will contribute to several fields of sociology,                   
              including occupations, stratification, mobility, gender and race               
              relations.  In so doing, it will strengthen the knowledge base for             
              policy decisions concerning equal employment regulations and                   
              concerning the diversity of the future American labor force.
