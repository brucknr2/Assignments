Abstract    :
              9310306   Dennis   Multidisiciplinary Design Optimization (MDO) involves
              coupling  numerical optimization with analysis simulations to optimize an 
              overall design subject to the constraints imposed by its  components. 
              Efficient methods for achieving reliable solutions  to this class of problems
              will be examined, focusing on key MDO  challenges such as:  determining the
              type of feasibility to be  maintained at each optimization iteration, mixing
              discrete and  continuous variables, decomposing complex systems, and handling 
              multiple (competing) objective functions robustly.
