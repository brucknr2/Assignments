Abstract    :
              9310155  Lewontin  This award will support the research that uses the unique
              power  of parallel computing to provide a general picture of the  dynamics of
              genetic frequency change in multi-locus genetic  systems with recombination and
              selection considered  simultaneously.  The actual dynamics of the transient
              will be  analyzed by mapping out the vector fields for gametic frequencies  and
              following the changes in the conformation of these fields as  the selection and
              recombination parameter are perturbed  systematically.    ***
