Abstract    :
              9310366  Entwisle         This is a study of change in settlement patterns, road
               systems, cropping patterns, and deforestation in Nang Rong,  Thailand,
              integrating social data collected on the ground with  spatial data largely
              collected by orbiting satellites.  The project  will capitalize on the analytic
              power of Geographic Information  System technology through an assessment of
              spatial and social co-  occurrences.  It will merge satellite data with
              existing social  data collected in 1984 and 1988, and begin descriptive
              analyses  relating social and environmental change.  In addition, it will 
              insure that valuable socio-geographic data are obtained in  fieldwork to be
              conducted in 1993-1994.         This award from the National Science Foundation
              greatly  enhances the social-scientific payoff from a project already 
              partially funded by other government agencies.  This will be the  first time
              sociologists have made serious use of data collected by  orbiting satellite,
              and thus it will provide important information  about the potential of this
              novel approach.    ***
