Abstract    :
              9310439  Zvanut  This project is designed to study the microscopic aspects of
              defects in diamond thin films grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD). 
              Electrical measurements such as steady state current measurements, ac impedance
              measurements, and metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) device measurements will be
              used to characterize the diamond film. In addition, the powerful spectroscopy
              of electron paramagetic resonance (PER) will be employed to extract important
              information about defects and impurities at the atomic level.    The
              investigation proposed here will provide closer look at the insulating and
              semiconducting properties of thin film diamond particularly those properties
              related to device applications.  For example, since a MOS device must be
              capable of withstanding continued voltage stress, we will study the breakdown
              field of synthetic diamond films to test the effects of various fabrication
              procedures.  Furthermore, the effects of long term current flow will be
              addressed in terms of electron and hole trapping kinetics and energetic.  The
              proposed project will address these properties of the insulating diamond film
              as well as properties of the semiconducting diamond.  ***
