Abstract    :
                The goal of this research is the design, analysis, and  implementation of
              algorithms and data structures for a    collection of geometric  computational
              tools.  These tools are  chosen to directly   address existing  computational
              problems in  application areas including data   compression,  molecular 
              biology, geographic information systems, and   computational  fluid  dynamics. 
              In particular the following areas are considered.          (1) Practical
              algorithms and data structures for nearest            neighbor searching  in
              high dimensions, and                     applications to   problems in data 
              compression.         (2)   Algorithms and data structures for   detecting
              intersections and simulating the motion of a set of             moving objects
              in two  and three dimensional space.         (3)  Construction and  
              maintenance of  triangulations with          specified shape requirements and  
              applications to  geographic information systems and mesh generation           
              in computational  fluid dynamics.    Emphasis is on practical, implementable  
              to these problems, and both theoretical and empirical   analyses  of their 
              performance.
