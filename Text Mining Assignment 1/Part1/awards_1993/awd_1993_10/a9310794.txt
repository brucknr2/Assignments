Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a study of American racial attitudes through 1993, building            
              on earlier research published in the book, Racial Attitudes in                 
              America: Trends and Interpretations, which charted these trends                
              through 1983.  It will analyze them in more recent data sets such              
              as the 1992 National Election Study, the 1993 General Social                   
              Survey, and the most recent, relevant Gallup survey.  Contemporary             
              racial issues will be included, and the project will incorporate               
              new empirical and theoretical work that will enrich the                        
              interpretations of important relationships between change in racial            
              attitudes and other variables, such as age, attitudes toward                   
              government enforcement, and the effects of social desirability on              
              the validity of self-reported opinion.                                         
                                                                                             
              This research will contribute significantly to the field of race               
              and ethnic relations, one of the intellectually most important                 
              areas of sociology with the greatest significance for American                 
              social policy.  The original book was very influential with both               
              scholars and educated non-academic readers, and the addition of a              
              decade of data and theoretical insights will be a substantial                  
              contribution to the knowledge base for understanding one of the                
              most difficult social problems in the United States.
