                              This project comprises three components uniqueness of
              minimizers for polyconvex energy functionals that arise in nonlinear
              elasticity.  Criteria will be develop to distinguish those deformations that
              are diffeomorphisms;  ii) stability and interaction of vortices (or defects) in
              time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau or Landau- Stuart models describing superfluids
              or superconductors.  Various conjectures by physicists and applied
              mathematicians will be examined;  iii) minimization problems concerning
              ferro-magnetic materials.  The goal is to determine whether configurations that
              have been experimentally observed occur as limits of minimizers to the
              corresponding magnetic energy functionals. The above project concerns three
              mathematical models formulated by physicists and material scientists in order
              to describe the behavior of certain materials.  The goal of this proposal is to
              determine rigorously whether solutions to the given mathematical models do,
              indeed, exhibit the expected behavior in each case. The first problem concerns
              deformations of certain hyper-elastic materials in two or three space
              dimensions.  The presence or absence of singularities (such as sharp edges or
              interfaces) will be examined. The second problem concerns defects in a
              superconducting material. It is proposed to  determine how such defects
              interact and stabilize  in time.  In particular, conjectures by physicists
              about when defects split apart or disappear will be investigated.  The third
              problem concerns properties of materials which are magnetically saturated.
              Certain configurations of the magnetic field have been observed experimentally,
              and we wish to investigate whether stable solutions to the mathematical model
              exhibit these configurations.
