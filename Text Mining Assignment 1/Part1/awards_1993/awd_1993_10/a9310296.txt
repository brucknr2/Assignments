Abstract    :
              9310296  Bartolotti  The proposed postdoctoral training and research plan
              involves the  development of empirical and quantum mechanical force fields for 
              use in molecular dynamics simulations, and application to  biological systems
              containing metal ions.  The main objective of  the development research is to
              design functional molecular  dynamics code, both empirical and quantum
              mechanical, for  studying large biological systems, optimized to run on the
              CRAY  supercomputers or on massively parallel machines  ***
