Abstract    :
              9310000 Haque          Materials courses introduced into curricula such as
              Mechanical Engineering necessarily constitute a small fraction of the total
              number of topics covered and face the danger of being considered fringe courses
              that have to be tolerated but not necessarily mastered by students.  It is
              therefore necessary to provide tools for students learning that make the
              contents interesting but also involve the students in their own learning. 
              Experiments in materials and manufacturing are a very necessary part of this
              attempt but by their very nature excludes manipulation and redesign by
              students.  They are typically set up by faculty and students whose
              understanding of the material far exceeds the maturity and knowledge of the
              undergraduate student.  They require significant lead  time to set up and are
              costly to implement.  The advent of high powered computer technologies and the
              development of computer simulation methods of manufacturing processes offer
              great potential as tools for teaching of undergraduates.          The objective
              is to incorporate a finite element based simulation package for forming
              processes into a senior level undergraduate materials laboratory for enhancing
              undergraduate student learning of materials and manufacturing processes.  This
              necessitates the development of course materials and careful design of
              numerical experiments that will encourage student exploration and enhance
              understanding of material behavior during forming.
