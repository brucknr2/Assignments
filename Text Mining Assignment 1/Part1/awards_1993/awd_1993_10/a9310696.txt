Abstract    :
              9310696 SANTOPIETRO Debt for nature swaps are being used by private
              international conservation non governmental organizations as a means of
              increasing the purchasing power of the financial resources they devote to the
              preservation of endangered areas around the world.  Preliminary research
              suggests that the decision making of managers in allocating funds among
              countries and projects has been heavily influenced by the legal costs of the
              transactions.  Legal costs divert a sponsor's funds away from conservation
              programs and thereby reduce the net benefit of the swap.  Differences in legal
              costs among countries can also bias the selection of sites, as managers seek to
              develop programs where legal costs are lower.  Economic theory predicts that
              changes in legal structures will be brought about by the activities of
              individuals seeking efficiency gains when legal costs of economic activities
              are reduced.  The objective of this project is to establish a base of knowledge
              about how national legal institutions affect the transaction costs of debt for
              nature swaps and how these institutions are affected by the potential for
              efficiency gains from changes in the legal system.  This planning grant will
              support preliminary data collection in three neighboring South American
              countries      Argentina, Chile and Paraguay.  The data collection will include
              interviews with participants in the debt for nature process, both in government
              and in non governmental organizations.   ***
