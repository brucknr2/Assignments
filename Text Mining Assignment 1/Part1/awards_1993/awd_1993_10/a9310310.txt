Abstract    :
              9310310   Perepezko   A detailed examination of the kinetics and mechanics
              involved in  heterogeneous nucleation will be performed using Monte Carlo-type 
              computer simulations employing massively parallel computers.   These
              simulations will be used as a part of an on-going  experimental and theoretical
              project aimed at determining the  effect of interface structure and dynamics on
              the formation of  secondary solid phases at the primary solid-melt interface.  
              These simulations will be an integral part of the study, and  results obtained
              will take an active role in determining future  experimental efforts.
