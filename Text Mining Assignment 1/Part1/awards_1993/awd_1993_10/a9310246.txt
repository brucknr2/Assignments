Abstract    :
              This award is made to Drs. Mark Hampden-Smith and William Buhro                
              in the Advanced Materials and Processing Program of the                        
              Chemistry Division to organize and partially support a                         
              Materials Chemistry Workshop. The first workshop, to be held in                
              Albuquerque, NM.,October 21-24,1993, will bring together about                 
              thirty participants, active in materials chemistry research and                
              education, to discuss in an informal setting, research in                      
              progress and new directions for materials chemistry. The focus                 
              of the workshop will be the molecular chemical aspects of                      
              materials science.  Participants will be drawn from academia,                  
              industry and government laboratories and each participant will                 
              give a thirty minute presentation of his or her work. A report,                
              summarizing workshop discussions will be produced and submitted                
              for publication in appropriate materials-related journals.

              The subject workshop brings together active researchers to                     
              discuss ideas and identify new directions and opportunities for                
              chemists and chemistry in Advanced Materials and Processing, a                 
              critical technology for national growth and development.
