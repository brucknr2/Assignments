Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Equipment for the study of organometallic vapor-phase epitaxy                  
              (OMVPE) of several semiconductors, including gallium arsenide and              
              cadmium telluride, on such substrates as gallium arsenide or                   
              silicon, is being upgraded.  The upgrade consists of an OMPVE                  
              reactor with an ultrahigh-vacuum (UHV) interface, and a new                    
              manipulator for the existing UHV chamber.  This will enable the                
              study of surface reactions of organometallic compounds on the                  
              crystal surfaces actually found in the OMVPE process.  The                     
              improved apparatus will be used to study surface chemistry of                  
              II-VI compounds, heteroepitaxy of semiconductors, and OMVPE                    
              reaction kinetics.//
