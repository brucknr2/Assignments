Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT--CTS-9310942  The PI proposes to purchase an optical parametric
              generator (OPG) to produce tunable coherent radiation in the infrared (1.4 -
              4.0  m) spectral region for use in molecular spectroscopy using the degenerate
              four wave mixing (DFWM) technique.  The PI has pending proposals to investigate
              the detailed chemistry of soot formation in hydrocarbon diffusion flames and in
              diamond-forming chemical vapor deposition processes.  Infrared DFWM is planned
              to be used in studying these systems.  The OPG generates coherent radiation
              over a range of wavelengths previously inaccessible so that concentrations of
              stable and radical species important in hydrocarbon reaction systems such as
              C2H2 and CH3, can be measured in situ.  In order to interpret these
              measurements the PI also intends to further develop the theory of DFWM,
              especially as it applies to molecules with more than 2 atoms.
