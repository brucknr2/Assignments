Abstract    :
              9310574  Bender       As part of the U.S.JGOFS Arabian Sea Process Study effort
              to  understand how physical forcing by the regional monsoons affects  marine
              primary production and the regional carbon budget, the PI  will carry out
              shipboard incubations of seawater samples to  estimate seasonal photosynthetic
              production rates of molecular  oxygen.  Because the oxygen and organic carbon
              produced during  photosynthesis are in a fixed proportion, these measurements
              will  provide indirect measurements of primary production by making  direct
              measurements of carbon.  Similar shipboard laboratory  studies will be carried
              out at different light levels to derive  quantitative relationships that would
              then permit the estimation  of in situ water column production rates from
              bio-optical data.  Additionally, in order to calculate how much of the oxygen 
              escapes to the atmosphere, the PI plans to make frequent  measurements of
              dissolved oxygen and argon (a non-reactive gas  that can be used as a mixing
              tracer) in the upper wind-mixed  water column along the cruise track.  The PI
              expects these  studies to provide major insights into the oxygen and carbon 
              dynamics of the Arabian Sea region and that these insights will  benefit our
              understanding of the global carbon cycle.  ***
