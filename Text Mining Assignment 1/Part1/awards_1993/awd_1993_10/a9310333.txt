Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a request for support for seven students and postdocs to               
              attend the Bat Sheva Seminar on "Neurons and Neuronal Networks in              
              the Motor System" at Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Israel, from                
              March 14-15, 1993.  The motor system controls the position of                  
              organisms and their movement in the external world by a complex                
              assembly of neuronal networks.  Intricate motor paradigms of                   
              movements and postural adjustments constitute almost all the                   
              behavioral patterns expressed in our daily life.  Understanding of             
              the motor system and its neural control mechanisms are therefore               
              one of the most important aspects of modern neurobiology.  This                
              seminar is aimed at studying the motor system using an                         
              interdisciplinary research approach, starting from structural and              
              functional aspects of single cells in the motor system, continuing             
              with central neuronal networks, and ending with combined                       
              physiological and artificial intelligence studies.  This approach              
              will provide us better understanding of mechanisms involved in the             
              execution of motor behavior.  This seminar is an outstanding                   
              opportunity to facilitate advances in interdisciplinary training in            
              basic neuroscience and motor control, and to bring together                    
              students and top-scientists from all over the world for a period of            
              two weeks.  Previous experience with Bat-Sheva seminars shows that             
              it was very fruitful with good interactions among the participants             
              and students, and this coming seminar seems to be more popular than            
              the previous ones.***//
