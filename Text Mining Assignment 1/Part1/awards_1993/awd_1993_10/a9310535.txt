Abstract    :
              9310535  KAGAN  This project concerns the relationship between community status
              and  local environmental conditions.  Significant evidence points to a 
              disproportionate impact of industrial environmental hazards on poor  and
              minority communities but little is known about the place of  regulatory
              mandates and administrative enforcement practices in the  creation of such
              disparities.  This study will consider this  question in the context of agency
              responses to air pollution odor  nuisance complaints, a regulatory arena
              subject to common law  reactive structures and a commitment to local norms and 
              environmental diversity.    Detailed case studies derived from interviews of
              agency staff and  administrative records will be used in an analysis of the
              place of  community and complainant identity in the public nuisance 
              enforcement policies of three air pollution control agencies.   Intra-agency
              comparison of complaint based enforcement within  demographically distinct
              communities will be combined with inter-  agency comparison of the handling of
              such disputes.  The two tiers  of this comparison will allow distinctions to be
              made between the  contributions to implementation outcomes of, respectively,
              legal  mandates and administrative choices.  ***
