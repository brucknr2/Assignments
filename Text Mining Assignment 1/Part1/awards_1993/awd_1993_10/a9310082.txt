Abstract    :
              Louri         As device speeds rise, communication rather than device  speed
              becomes the limiting factor in performance and cost of  high-performance
              computing systems.  Optical interconnects offer  the potential for high-speed,
              scalable communications that can  keep up with progress in devices.  This
              research explores the  application of free-space optics to high-density
              interconnects  that are capable of bandwidth, interconnect density, and error 
              rates far beyond the capabilities of current electrical  interconnects and
              backplanes.  The approach consists of:  1.     developing suitable optical
              network topologies;  2.     identifying optical implementation techniques and
              required  devices;  3.     identifying interface components;  4.     developing
              modeling and simulation techniques for evaluating  the performance of the
              chosen topologies and implementations; and  5.     physically implementing and
              measuring some of the resulting  networks.
