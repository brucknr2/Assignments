Abstract    :
              Durham/Sawyer  9310622    The conditions under which sustainable development and
              resource conservation can occur are frequently modeled in narrow economic
              terms.  In contrast, this project investigates land use in the context of
              community politics within an indigenous community of the Pastaza Runa of
              Ecuadorian Amazon.  The goal is to understand the forces directing distinct
              households' agricultural practices and political allegiances.  Three
              methodological tools will be employed.  First, the analysis of agricultural
              techniques in swidden systems and the mapping of multi-level land use (swidden
              agriculture, commercial crop production, and cattle grazing) detail actual
              practices and examine indicators for the intensification and/or depletion of
              resources.  Second, interviews with household members elicit historical
              understandings of land use changes, resource conflicts, and households'
              affiliation with the local Indian federations or Campesino organization. 
              Third, archival research of state, church, indigenous relations and state
              adjudicational legislation presents historical insight into changing racial and
              legal relations of Indians in the Oriente.  The research is significant on two
              counts.  It contributes to scholarship on indigenous resource management and
              ethnicity by investigating the conditions under which indigenous peoples
              practice ecologically sound land use and maintain a politicized ethnic
              identity.  In examining refinements in native politics and land-use along the
              colonization frontier, the study extends current knowledge of options of
              sustainable agriculture in the neotropics.      ~  u     F  V  F   V   9V ~
