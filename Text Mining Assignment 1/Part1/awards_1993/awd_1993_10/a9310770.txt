                bioremediation requires that competent degradative bacteria be able to
              penetrate soil or aquifer solids to reach the contamination.  One of the major
              obstacles to this approach is that bacteria often adhere strongly to solid
              surfaces and plug porous materials rather than pass through them.  Our Phase I
              research demonstrated the feasibility of isolating non adhesive variants of
              several different bacterial strains that are capable of degrading a suite of
              chlorinated organic chemicals commonly found as contaminants in groundwater and
              aquifers.  The strains that were developed in Phase I have the potential to
              travel at least an order of magnitude further into aquifer solids than their
              adhesive parental strains.  By using trichloroethylene as a model chlorinated
              organic, we also demonstrated that the degradative competence of these non
              adhesive variants had not been altered.  Phase II research will bring this
              technology to commercialization by establishing a number of operating
              parameters for the use of these non adhesive degradative strains    in      
              situ   .  In addition to establishing the stability of the adhesion deficient
              phenot ype, we will measure the penetration and degradative efficiency of these
              strains in different types of aquifer material.  A pilot scale model aquifer
              will be constructed and used to demonstrate an    in       situ   
              bioremediation system based on the use of these highly specialized
              microorganisms. %%% Ground water pollution is a growing problem worldwide and
              the development of methods to control it are extremely important.  One method
              to confront this problem is to continue to pump water and purify it on the
              surface.  Since this is very expensive, new methods are being sought to destroy
              water contaminating chemicals by using microorganisms in the well, or in the
              aquifer, itself.  These cells can consume contaminating chemicals and purify
              the water.  However, during the process, the cells that degrade the polluting
              compounds stick to soil particles, and, as they metabolize pollutants, they
              grow and eventually plug the well.  In an attempt to circumvent this problem,
              we developed certain strains of pollutant degrading, non sticking, or non
              adhering, bacteria.  In the present research program, we will determine if
              these non adhering cells work equally well in ground water purification, but
              without growing into a barrier and plugging the flow of water into the well.
