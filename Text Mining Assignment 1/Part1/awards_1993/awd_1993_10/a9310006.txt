Abstract    :
              9310006 Trappe          Research is proposed to determine whether mycorrhizal
              fungi accelerate plant community development.  A series of greenhouse and field
              studies at the Lyman Glacier forefront in Washington are planned to test: 
              whether VAM enhance the survival and growth of early colonizers; whether
              surviving mycorrhizal plants allow greater mycorrhizal fungal diversification;
              and whether the resultant positive feedback between plant establishment,
              environmental modification, and fungal diversification ultimately increase
              rates of community development and system carbon accretion.  Specifically,
              researchers will measure how mycorrhizal formation and soil carbon accretion
              vary as a function of distance from existing plant islands; how mycorrhizal
              fungi, environmental modification by established plants, soil organic matter,
              and inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus affect new plant survival and
              colonization in the field; and test the ability of dark septate endophytes to
              act as bridges between established plants and colonizing plants. %%% Results of
              these studies would provide evidence on the degree to which mycorrhizae are
              responsible factors aiding plant colonization, particularly in nutrient poor,
              harsh environments. ***
