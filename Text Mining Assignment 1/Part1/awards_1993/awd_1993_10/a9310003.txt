Abstract    :
              9310003  Dickinson    Most of the movements that animals make can occur under a
              variety  of internal external conditions, thus placing different demands on 
              the animal.  Consequently, the central pattern generators that are  responsible
              for producing the motor outputs to drive rhythmic  movements are highly
              flexible.  Under the influence of different  neuromodulators, these pattern
              generators can produce a variety of  different outputs.  In addition, many
              movements require the  coordination of large numbers of muscle groups,
              including ones that  may also be involved in controlling other behaviors.  This
              is  particularly clear in the case of functionally related rhythmic  patterns,
              such as those that drive the four parts of the foregut in  crustaceans.  Recent
              research on this system has shown that the  four pattern generators, which were
              once thought to be four  discrete entities, interact in a variety of ways.  The
              research to  be undertaken will examine a number of aspects of the 
              neuromodulation of the rhythmic motor systems in the stomatogastric  nervous
              system, focusing on the interactions of the pattern  generators.  In addition,
              this research will address another issue  that has arisen recently, namely the
              effects of modulation on  spatially distributed pattern generating networks.***
