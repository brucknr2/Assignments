Abstract    :
              9310460  Berger  This project will investigate the interaction between a
              magnetic  domain Bloch walls and an applied electric currents in nickel-iron 
              alloys.  The interaction depends on the magnetic exchange  interactions between
              the transport electron and the localized  magnetic atoms.  The wall
              displacements will be measured over a  range of current densities.  The
              critical current for incipient  wall displacement and the displacement as a
              function of pulse width  will also be investigated.  These measurements will be
              done in a  number of samples in the range 10-1000 nm.  The anisotropy of the 
              response will be determined using ferrofluids or polarizing  microscopes.  The
              primary objective is to understand the detailed  role of the Bloch wall lines
              as contributor to magnetoresistance in  the thin film materials.  %%%  In this
              project, the influence of an electric current on the  properties of a magnetic
              alloys of nickel and iron.  Iron and  nickel atoms act like miniature bar
              magnets.  In certain regions of  the sample, called magnetic domains, these
              atomic magnets all point  in the same direction.  The displacement of these
              domains induced  by an electric current flowing through the materials will be 
              investigated.  The magnitude of these displacements will be  determined for
              various values of the current density, and in  samples of various thicknesses. 
              Such motion of magnetic domains  may be used for storage of information in
              computer memories.  ***
