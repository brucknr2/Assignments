Abstract    :
              9310314   Vashishta   We propose to study the structural and dynamical
              properties of  graphitic tubules by means of computer simulation.  The systems 
              to be studied will include graphitic tubules with different  chiral symmetry;
              coaxial microtubes with the same or different  helical combinations; carbon
              cages; onion-like carbon clusters;  doughnut-like graphitic tubule ring; and
              graphitic tubule arrays.   Tight-binding molecular dynamics, used to
              investigate the  structural stability, mechanical properties at finite 
              temperature, structural transformations under external stresses--  compressing,
              stretching and twisting; the process of crack  propagation and fragmentation. 
              In addition, new simulation  techniques and efficient algorithms will be
              developed and  implemented on parallel architectures.
