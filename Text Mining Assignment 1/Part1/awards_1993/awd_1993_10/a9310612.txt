Abstract    :
              This project will involve the analysis of solitary waves, multi-  solitons, and
              related phenomena in the theory of nonlinear  dispersive systems without
              dissipation.  Several questions in the  analysis of solitary waves will be
              examined, including their  existence, uniqueness, and stability.  Numerical
              investigations  will supplement theoretical analysis.  In addition, the
              validity  of various approximate equations and certain rigorous properties  of
              nonlinear dispersive systems of partial differential or  integro-differential
              equations will be considered.  The tools of  nonlinear analysis will be
              supplemented by some numerical  simulation and the special methods of inverse
              scattering theory.   Solitary waves are localized, nonlinear, progressing waves
              that  subsist on a balance struck between nonlinear and dispersive  effects. 
              They arise in many physical settings.  Rigorous  analysis is often quite
              difficult since the problem is nonlinear  from the outset.  Nonlinear model
              equations have been developed  that predict the presence of solitary waves and
              capture their  qualitative features.  The systems to be studied arise in many 
              areas of nonlinear science including fluid mechanics, nonlinear  optics, solid
              state physics, oceanography, and meteorology.
