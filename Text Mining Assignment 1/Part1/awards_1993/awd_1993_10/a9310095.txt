Abstract    :
              Abstract - Rollins, 9310095      Gross error detection (GED) is directed at
              identifying and correcting inaccurately measured process variables when
              nuisance quantities (gross errors by some researchers' terminology) contribute
              to physical process constraints not being satisfied.  These nuisance quantities
              include biased measurements, process leaks, and other physical parameters that
              can cause inaccurate estimation of process variables.  Two reasons GED has not
              seen widespread use in the chemical process industries are its poor performance
              and limited applications.    The major objective of this research is to
              increase the use of GED in plant operations when the steady-state assumption is
              invalid (i.e. dynamic conditions).  The PI plans to develop a statistical
              approach that will provide accurate detection, identification, and estimation
              of process variables with gross errors and measures of performance, such as
              confidence intervals for true values and power functions for controlling error
              rates.  The research addresses dynamic processes operating at a set point
              (pseudo steady state) and dynamic processes with changing steady states.    The
              anticipated results include a-level global tests, a-level tests for specific
              identification, power functions for all tests, unbiased (or nearly unbiased)
              estimators, consistent estimators, and 100(1-a)% simultaneous confidence
              intervals when variances and covar                                             
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
                    iances of measurement errors are known and unknown.  The scope of the
              work includes missing data, unmeasured variables, and serially correlated data.
               In addition, the PI plans to incorporate the work into an overall strategy to
              detect, identify, and correct process measurements with gross errors when
              conditions are dynamic.
