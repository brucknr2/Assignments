Abstract    :
              9310883  Wentworth  The Department of Electrical Engineering at Auburn
              University will purchase Vector Network Analysis equipment which will be
              dedicated to support research in engineering.  The network analysis system is
              capable of precise, low noise measurement of electrical parameters at
              frequencies up to 50 gigahertz.  The system is composed of a synthesized
              sweeper, a test set, and a network analyzer.  The sweeper provides a pure,
              stable signal over the frequency range from 45 megahertz to 50 gigahertz.  The
              test set connects to the device under test, and acts as a signal separation
              device to resolve incident, reflected and transmitted signals.  The network
              analyzer contains both an extremely sensitive receiving apparatus as well as a
              control and display interface.    The proposed equipment is also expected to
              make an impact on education, by exposing students to the state-of-the-art in
              microwave testing.  ***
