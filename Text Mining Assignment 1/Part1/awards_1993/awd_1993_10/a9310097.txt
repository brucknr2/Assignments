Abstract    :
              9310097  Kraus  The focus of this research is the use of a photochemical 
              alternative to the Lewis acid catalyzed Friedel-Crafts  processes used in the
              production of compounds such as diazepam,  zomepirac, acebutolol, ibuprofen and
              doxepin. A second project  involves the development of polymer-supported
              reagents to  supplant chromic acid for the oxidation of alcohols to ketones. 
              %%%  With this Environmentally Benign Chemical Synthesis and  Processing award,
              the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting  the research of Dr. George A.
              Kraus of the Department of  Chemistry at Iowa State University.  Dr. Kraus will
              focus his  work on a photochemical alternatives to commercial scale  reactions
              now requiring aluminum chloride or chromic acid as  key reagents.  The approach
              would eliminate the production of  vast quantities of toxic by-products.  ***
