Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research investigation brings together research and methods               
              from behavioral decision theory and computational modeling to                  
              explore process theories of voting.  Combining survey data with                
              computer simulations, in what is called computational experiments,             
              the investigators can compare and evaluate process theories of                 
              candidate evaluation and choice.                                               
                                                                                             
              The investigators undertake five experimenal studies using this                
              method to investigate important isssues in the candidate evaluation            
              process, including the impact of issue complexity (whether                     
              candidates qualify their positions or state them simply),                      
              information order, presentation format, and the affect of trait                
              inferences of candidates on the evaluation of the candidates.  This            
              unique investigation allows significant methodological advances in             
              our understanding of the affect of issue and trait in candidate                
              evaluation and candidate selection.
