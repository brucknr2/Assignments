Abstract    :
              9310711  Winkler    Mr. David G. Haskell's doctoral-dissertation research will
              investigate how  variations in predation risk have affected the evolution of
              begging calls of nestling  wood warblers (Parulidae).  These diverse New World
              tropical migrants nest in a  wide variety of sites, and Mr. Haskell's recent
              experiments show that nestlings  begging from ground nests incur greater
              increases in the risk of predation than do  nestlings begging from trees.  Mr.
              Haskell will now test the hypothesis that  ground-nesting species have begging
              calls that are harder to hear and to locate  than the begging calls of
              tree-nesting species.    This will be the first comparative study of nestling
              calls to use standardized  recording protocols and to take into account the
              phylogenetic relationships of the  species being compared.  Predation is the
              major source of mortality for most  nestling birds, an the results of this
              study should be of interest to biologists  interested in the productivity of
              bird populations and the behaviors that have  evolved to mitigate nestling
              mortality.  The evolution of begging has also been the  subject of considerable
              theoretical work, and this study should be of interest to  biologists studying
              the evolution of parent-offspring interactions as well.
