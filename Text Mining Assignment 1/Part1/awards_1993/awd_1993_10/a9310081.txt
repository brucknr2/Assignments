Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is twofold. The first goal is the                   
              development of better enzymes for the synthesis of peptides and                
              their isosteric and glycosylated derivatives and for the                       
              oxidation and halohydration of olefins.  The second goal is the                
              development of chemical/enzymatic strategies for the synthesis                 
              and use of sugar nucleotide and oligosaccharide mimetics.  The                 
              project will advance our understanding of biomolecular                         
              recognition and catalysis and provide new methodologies and                    
              strategies for asymmetric synthesis that complement abiological                
              approaches.

              With this Accomplishment Based Award, the Synthetic Organic                    
              Program is supporting the research of Dr. Chi-Huey Wong of the                 
              Department of Chemistry at Scripps Clinic and Research                         
              Foundation.  Professor Wong will focus his work on the                         
              development of novel enzymatic catalysts for use in the                        
              key-step synthesis of designed molecules with biological                       
              significance.
