Abstract    :
              This research addresses the formation of a standard for                        
              performing point-to-point message passing between pairs of                     
              processes in a MIMD distributed memory computing systems.  A                   
              small set of typed message passing routines form the core of the               
              standard, and are augmented by support for features such as                    
              noncontiguous messages, communication contexts, and process                    
              groups.  The proposed standard activity is called Message Passing              
              Interface Forum. (MPI).                                                        
                                                                                             
              The main advantages of establishing a message passing standard                 
              are portability and ease-of-use.  In a distributed memory                      
              communication environment in which the higher level routines                   
              and/or abstractions are built upon lower level message passing                 
              routines the benefits of standardization are particularly                      
              apparent.  Furthermore, the definition of a message passing                    
              standard, such as that proposed here, provides vendors with a                  
              clearly defined base set of routines that they can implement                   
              efficiently, or in some cases provide hardware support for,                    
              thereby enhancing scalability.
