Abstract    :
              9310762     Graessley    It is proposed to develop a broad base of fundamental
              information  on the melt state thermodynamics of polyolefin blends.  This will 
              be accomplished by a combination of techniques -- small-angle  neutron
              scattering to evaluate thermodynamic interactions in the  single phase region,
              laser light scattering to confirm the location  of phase boundaries, and
              equation-of-state measurements to assist  interpretation and generalization of
              the results.  The previous  studies with model polyolefins, synthesized by
              saturating the  double bonds on nearly monodisperse polydienes, will be
              extended.   Structurally uniform polyolefins with well-defined molecular weight
               distributions, made by metallocene (single site) catalysts, will  now be
              included.    Aside from supplying thermodynamic information for an extremely 
              important class of polymeric materials, the proposed work will  provide tests
              of current theories of thermodynamics for polymeric  mixtures where the local
              interactions are simple, at least in  principle, and the local structures are
              well defined.  The result  will be useful in guiding the development of new
              blends based on  polyolefins as well as the mixing of structures in plastics 
              recycling.  ***
