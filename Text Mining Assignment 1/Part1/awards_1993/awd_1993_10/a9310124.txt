Abstract    :
                   The dynamics of hadronic and nuclear systems will be                      
              studied, with emphasis on the connections to the underlying                    
              quark-gluon symmetry and dynamics.  The specific areas to be                   
              investigated include the behavior of strangeness in extreme                    
              conditions, chiral symmetry as manifested in exchange                          
              currents in nuceli, the dynamics of nucleon-antinucleon                        
              annihilation, flavor symmetry properties of hadron structure                   
              as revealed by external current probes, and the                                
              astrophysical applications of neutrino-nucleus reactions.
