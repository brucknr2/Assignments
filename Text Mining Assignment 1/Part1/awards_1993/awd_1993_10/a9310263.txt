              investigator proposes to study sums of independent random variables and
              quadratic forms.  The topics envisioned include strong limit problems,
              approximation of expectations for sums having a fixed or random number of
              terms, approximation of tail probabilities of sums of independent variates, and
              decoupling issues for quadratic and multilinear forms.          This is
              research in basic probability theory.  In particular, the investigator will
              study sums of independent random variables and probabilities associated with
              those sums. ***
