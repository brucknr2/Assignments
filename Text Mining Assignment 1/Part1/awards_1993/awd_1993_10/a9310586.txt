Abstract    :
              9310586  Krauss    Conversational gestures are unplanned, fluent hand movements
              that  often accompany spontaneous speech.  Traditionally it has been  assumed
              that such gestures serve a communicative function - i.e,  that speakers use
              them to convey information to an addressee in  much the same way they use
              language.  However, the empirical  evidence supporting this assumption is
              tenuous, and recent  research suggests that gestures convey relatively little
              semantic  information.  In contrast, the lexical access hypothesis views 
              conversational gestures as an intrinsic part of the speech  production process,
              and hypothesizes that their primary function  is to help the speaker retrieve
              words from the mental lexicon.   however, these gestures may convey nonsemantic
              information about  a speaker's internal state, and such information can affect
              the  interpretation of the spoken message.  In this way, gestures may  play an
              important role in the regulation and maintenance of  social interaction.    A
              series of experiments will explore the functions conversational  gestures serve
              for speakers, the kinds of conceptual contents  whose expression they
              facilitate, the nonsemantic information  they convey to addressees, and the
              role that this kind of  information plays in interpersonal communication.  The
              results of  these studies will broaden our understanding of the basic 
              mechanisms underlying human communication.  The methodology  developed also has
              applications in research on communicative  disorders in which speakers
              experience difficulty in word  retrieval.  ***
