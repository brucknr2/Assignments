Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research investigation focuses on the interrelationship                   
              between public opinion and policy over time.  While a lot is known             
              about whether public opinion influences policy, little is known                
              about whether the public is itself responsive to policy behavior,              
              adjusting its preferences for policy activity in response to what              
              policymakers acutally do.  A responsive public would effectively               
              behave like a thermostat, where a deaprture from the favored policy            
              temperature produces a signal to adjust policy accordingly and,                
              once sufficiently adjusted, the signal stops.                                  
                                                                                             
              This research investigation considers whether the public behaves               
              thermostatically, and relies primarily on statistical analyses of              
              budgetary policy and public preferences for spending over time,                
              across a range of budget opinion domains.  The research addresses              
              both the influence of public preferences for more spending on                  
              budgetary policy and the influence of those decisions, in turn, on             
              public preferences.  Preliminary analysis suggests that there are              
              strong reciprocal connections between public inputs into the                   
              policymaking process and the outputs the process generates.  In its            
              simplest sense, when the public wants more spending it gets more,              
              and when it gets more it doesn't want as much more.  This research             
              produces important insights in the public policy/public opinion                
              interrelationship.
