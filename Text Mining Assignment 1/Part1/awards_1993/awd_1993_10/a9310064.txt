Abstract    :
                   Representations of Graphs by Sets.  This work will focus on               
              p-intersection equivalence and general representations of graphs.              
              Randomized algorithm techniques, algebraic graph theory and the                
              probabilistic method will be applied to solutions of problems in               
              the focus area and provide a better understanding of the                       
              relationship to computer science and other areas of mathematics.
