              dissertation research proposal to study the human activity and wildlife
              movement in the Maasai Steppe of Tanzania received supportive reviews except
              for Fratkin.  He challenges the student's methodology, claiming that the
              student will take four fly-over flights and use Landsat images for his data. 
              This is a misreading of the proposal, since the student clearly states that he
              will survey area residents and interview them about their socio-economic
              relationships (pp 7-9).  Fratkin then goes on to criticize the proposal for not
              being specific enough.    In my opinion, Fratkin is hypercritical.  The other
              reviews make sensible suggestions but rank the proposal more highly, which I
              agree with.  The Professor informs me that the student has other support from
              Fulbright (thus answering Fratkin's criticisms about the student's budget). 
              The student will do the research, and NSF's contribution is important to make
              sure the full scientific significance is forthcoming.    The PIs submitted a
              reduced budget for $7,502, omitting areas of duplication with their other
              support.    I recommend that this proposal be funded.   DAMmmm d, yyyy    PG  
              9310479  Little     This research supports the dissertation study of a student
              from the State University of New York at Binghamton, exploring the causes
              behind changing land use activities among herders and farmers in a wildlife
              area of Tanzania, Africa.  The project will try to understand how human
              activities in the wildlife area impact on the wildlife movements (wildebeest,
              zebra, buffalo, elephant, giraffe, and others), blocking them out of some areas
              and channeling them into others.  Using aerial photography, data from remote
              sensing, and ethnographic survey and interview methods, the student will
              document the changes in land use in the wild life area over time, identify the
              people using new land use practices, and predict the impact of land use 
              restrictions on human behavior and through that, onto the area wildlife.   
              This research is important because Africa is one of the last areas of major
              wildlife forms.  The shrinking areas devoted to wildlife must be protected, but
              the local populations' needs for subsistence must be understood and dealt with;
              otherwise any conservation plans will be frustrated.  This sort of project will
              produce valuable information to help planners manage these unique and valuable
              resources.  ***    LBRV 1    LBLG STU                                      LBCD
