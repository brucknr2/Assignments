Abstract    :
              9310758  Gladue    Pollution, overfishing, health concerns and increased
              consumer  demand have enhanced the importance of acquaculture as a source of 
              edible seafood.  However, increased production of cultured marine  finfish will
              depend on improvements in larval culture, currently  hampered by inadequate
              supplies of rotifers (B.  plicatilis), which  are used as larval fish food. 
              And rotifers feed on microalgae,  which can be difficult and expensive to
              produce.  Heterotrophic  (without light) production of algae should
              significantly reduce the  cost and difficulty of rotifer production while
              significantly  reducing water usage.  This Phase II project will measure the 
              growth and survival of larval red drum (Sciaenops ocellata) on  rotifers that
              are fed heterotrophic vs. photosynthetic algae.  The  ability of the
              heterotrophic algae to be cultured at high biomass  densities in laboratory-
              and production-scale fermentors will also  be evaluated.
