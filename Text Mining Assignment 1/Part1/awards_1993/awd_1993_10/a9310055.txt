Abstract    :
              9310055  Bates  This award renews a binational study for its second and final
              year involving collaboration between researchers in the U.S. and Italy.
              Disaster mitigation and environmental protection policy are the primary focus
              of the research.  In the U.S., case studies are being conducted on recent
              events that have implications for mitigation and preparedness policies,
              including the Loma Prieta earthquake and Hurricane Andrew.  The Italian
              National Research Council is funding the Italian collaborators on this
              binational study.     u    ~       tional study for its second and final year
