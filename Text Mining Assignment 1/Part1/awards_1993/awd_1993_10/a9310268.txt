Abstract    :
                        9310268  Wheelwright  The Bowdoin Scientific Station is a biological
              field station  located on Kent Island, New Brunswick, Canada.  The 80-ha
              island,  ringed by 7 km of sandy beaches and rocky intertidal, has a  diversity
              of habitats, including boreal forest, old fields, and  marsh, and has easy
              access to other islands in the Bay of Fundy.   Owned and operated since 1935 by
              Bowdoin College in Brunswick,  Maine, the field station has promoted biological
              research by  faculty, graduate students, and undergraduates from numerous U.S. 
              colleges and universities.  BSS is unusual among North American  field stations
              in offering both terrestrial and marine boreal  habitats, and having long-term
              databases on local climate and  vertebrate populations.  Working closely with
              senior researchers,  hundreds of undergraduates have been trained at BSS, and
              many  have gone on to prominent careers in science.      The field station has
              recently modernized its research facilities  and scientific equipment, and
              expanded the research program.  Of  the 109 scientific papers based on research
              at BSS since 1935, 24  have been published in the last six years.  The field
              station's  location makes it ideal for research in marine biology and island 
              biogeography.  However, many on-going projects are limited (and  new projects
              prevented) by the lack of facilities for marine  research.  Most importantly,
              the station currently lacks an  adequate boat for safe transportation in the
              Bay of Fundy.  As  long-term databases at BSS have grown, new computer
              equipment is  required for database management.  The field station's 
              photovoltaic system needs to be expanded to meet the energy  demands imposed by
              increasing use of laboratory equipment and  computers.  This project will
              address those needs.  ***
