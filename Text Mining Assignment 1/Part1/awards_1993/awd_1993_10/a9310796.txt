Abstract    :
              9310796  Mandelbaum       NYSERNet, Inc. requests resources for continued
              development  of NYSERNet's New York State high speed data communications 
              network through 1995.  With these resources NYSERNet will;       1. Establish
              and support new high bandwidth applications and  technical and end-user users
              groups;       2. Expand technical support and user services support for  its
              members and affiliates;       3. Provide significant advice and direction to
              New York  State's K-12 National Research and Education Network (NREN)  access
              efforts.       The challenge facing NYSERNet include: 1) delivering new 
              capabilities, such as: Image Transfer, Multi-Media Database  Access and
              Multi-Media Mail; interactive-network based distance  learning; and the other
              applications described above;               2) continually improving network
              services in support of research  and education to a widely varied and
              increasing user community of  researchers, scholars, and educators in the
              natural sciences,  social sciences, mathematics, engineering, humanities, and
              health  sciences; 3) insuring that, after the next several years of  planned
              changes to the NSFNET, NYSERNET's affiliates continue to  enjoy the
              interconnectedness they now have, both nationally and  internationally; and 4)
              increasing the utility of the Network to  both sophisticated and new users.    
                There are four dimensions of growth and development of this  community: 1)
              there will be more users at more NYSERNet member  and affiliate sites; 2) each
              user will make more use of the  network; 3) each use will be more complex; and
              4) there will be  more new applications, especially in the areas of interactive
               computing, visualization, and collaboration.  ***
