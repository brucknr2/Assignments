Abstract    :
              9310295   Schlick   The goal in this proposal is to extend this work further so
              that  is can be applied routinely to protein and nucleic acids.  We  propose to
              develop and implement a new algorithm that combines  implicit-integration and
              normal-mode techniques.  The new  algorithm will maintain the large time-step
              stability inherited  in the implicit scheme, but also resolve the
              high-frequency  components of the motion so that the activities of
              high-frequency  modes can be retained.  With parallel implementations on 
              state-of-the-art machines, this will make possible simulations at  time-steps
              of order 100 femtoseconds; the total simulation time  will then approach the
              millisecond range.
