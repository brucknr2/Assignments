Abstract    :
              An instrument is being assembled that consists of a custom-made                
              calorimeter with a response time of less than thirty seconds                   
              (compared with five minutes or so for commercial                               
              microcalorimeters) and capability for simultaneous investigation               
              of the sample withattenuated total reflectance infrared                        
              spectroscopy.  The rapidresponse time will permit determination                
              of the heat of a process such as adsorption before subsequent                  
              slower processes obscure the measurement, while simultaneous                   
              infrared spectroscopy allows identification of the site of the                 
              process in cases where more than one possibility exists.  Among                
              systems to be studied with this new technique are nitric oxide                 
              on metal oxides or on metal zeolites and pyridine or ammonia on                
              zeolites.
