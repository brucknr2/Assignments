Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Technical Narrative:                                                           
                                                                                             
              This project represents a collaborative research                               
              effort involving  the Woods Hole Oceanographic                                 
              Institution (WHOI), the Massachusetts Institute                                
              of Technology (MIT), and Middle East Technical                                 
              University (METU) in Ankara, Turkey.  Project                                  
              funding will enable Dr. Temel Oguz of METU to                                  
              spend one year working at both MIT and WHOI; he                                
              will work directly with Dr. David Aubrey (WHOI)                                
              and Dr. Paola Rizzoli (MIT) on numerical                                       
              simulation of general circulation within the                                   
              Black Sea as well as the processes responsible                                 
              for eddy formation around the periphery of the                                 
              main basin.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              For many years, the Black Sea riparian countries                               
              have investigated the general circulation of the                               
              Black Sea.  Bulgaria and the former Soviet Union                               
              have been two of the lead countries performing                                 
              such modelling; more recently, highly qualified                                
              Turkish scientists have joined this modelling                                  
              effort.  Previous models were limited by lack of                               
              computer power, affecting spatial and temporal                                 
              resolution, and completeness of the models.  This                              
              U.S.-Turkey cooperative research project will                                  
              implement state-of-the-art numerical models to                                 
              investigate the relative contributions of wind-                                
              forcing and buoyancy fluxes in driving the                                     
              general Black Sea circulation.
