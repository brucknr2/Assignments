Abstract    :
              9310792  Luther       In the Arabian Sea, with its water circulation constrained
               by land masses on three sides, the seasonal pattern of primary  production and
              decay driven by the monsoon winds couples with  intense heating of surface
              water to promote formation of an  extensive subsurface zone of low-oxygen
              water--the oxygen minimum  zone (OMZ).  Particulate organic matter produced in
              the  oxygenated surface ocean sinks into the OMZ, where it may be  utilized by
              microbes that use sources other than oxygen --  namely, dissolved nitrate,
              iron, manganese, iodate -- for  respiration.  As part of the U.S.JGOFS Arabian
              Sea Process Study,  the investigators will investigate the role played by iron,
               manganese, and iodine oxidation-reduction couples in this  process.  Such a
              study will contribute to answering two larger  oceanographic questions:  How
              does the OMZ influence carbon  cycling?  Do anaerobic processes dominate in the
              OMZ?  By  sampling the water column in the vicinity of the OMZ at a series  of
              stations and coupling concentration data with hydrological  data on vertical
              and horizontal transport rates into a  mathematical reaction-transport model,
              the investigators will  estimate how important these minimally understood
              oxidation  pathways are in the regional picture of organic carbon oxidation.
