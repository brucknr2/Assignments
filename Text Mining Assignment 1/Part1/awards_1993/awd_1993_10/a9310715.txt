              Diagnostics and Predictions Using Nonlinear  Empirical Models                  
                           ABSTRACT             This project's main objectives are to develop
              and test  nonlinear statistical models for climate diagnostics and for  climate
              predictions.  The methodologies to be applied, based on  artificial neural
              networks and local-approximation models, have  been developed recently in the
              emerging fields of deterministic  chaos and parallel distributed processing. 
              The goal is to achieve  skillful models of sea surface temperature (SST)
              anomalies on  seasonal to interannual time scales for both the Pacific and 
              Atlantic basins and, through prediction, to enhance understanding  of the
              processes involved.         Climate variability on the seasonal to interannual
              time scale  is strongly related to ENSO.  Recent research suggests that ENSO, 
              primarily a Pacific signal, can be considered as a low-dimensional  chaotic
              system.  In addition, the Atlantic region also has major  climate variations
              shown in atmospheric and oceanic data.   Predictions of both ENSO and Atlantic
              oscillations will be  attempted by applying the nonlinear statistical modeling
              techniques  developed for the prediction of chaotic system behavior.  The 
              performance of several nonlinear statistical models will be  validated and
              optimized through hindcast experiments with data sets  from as early as 1950. 
              The absolute verification experiments will  be hindcasts of ENSO SST events in
              the period of 1985-1990, as  established by the Working Group of the TOGA
              Program on Seasonal to  Interannual Prediction (T-POP).         The algorithms
              developed, particularly those for the  Connection Machine, are based on new
              modeling techniques and will  be made readily available to the meteorological
              and oceanographic  communities.
