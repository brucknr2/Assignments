Abstract    :
                   The central problems in the random media theory are                       
              connected with the ideas of localization and intermittency which               
              were popular in the physical and mathematical literature during                
              last decade.  Recent progress in the lattice localization theory               
              makes the continuous models more realistic physically, especially              
              spectral problems for the random domains, manifolds, etc., and                 
              localization for the electromagnetic waves.  Another issue is the              
              asymptotic behavior of magnetic fields in turbulent flows, i.e.                
              the solutions of the Maxwell equations with random and non-linear              
              terms.  This set of problems is important in astrophysical                     
              applications (non-linear solar dynamo,solar wind etc.)                         
                   Random media theory is a new branch of probability theory                 
              closely connected with the modern mathematical and theoretical                 
              physics.  The basic problems on this area come from the natural                
              sciences: disordered solid state physics(including the theory of               
              semiconductors), astrophysics,in particular the theory of solar                
              magnetosphere and solar wind, and geophysics, mainly the theory                
              of seismic waves in lithosphere blocks with cracks.
