Abstract    :
              9310860  Bildstein, K.  Established in 1934, Hawk Mountain Sanctuary is the
              world's  oldest refuge for migratory raptors.  The Sanctuary straddles the 
              eastern most ridge of the Appalachian Mountains in eastern  Pennsylvania, along
              an important migration corridor for 16  species of raptors.  Hawk Mountain's
              56-year monitoring program  for migratory birds of prey has produced the
              longest and most  complete record of raptor migration in the world.  The 
              Sanctuary's annual counts of migrating hawks and eagles have  proved to be a
              critical resource in assessing long-term trends in  raptor populations in North
              America.  This extensive data base  played a key role in exposing
              organochlorine pesticides as  causative agents of declines in several species
              of predatory  birds earlier this century.  The Sanctuary's 890 hectares 
              represent the largest preserve of privately-owned and protected  secondary
              growth forest in the central Appalachians.  To date,  Sanctuary staff and
              collaborators have contributed more than 75  publications to the scientific
              literature.  Even so, limited  housing, laboratory space, and equipment have
              restricted use of  the Sanctuary's long-term record of raptor migration, and 
              its biotic resources by both resident staff and visiting  scientists.    This
              project will provide for site visit by consulting scientists  to assist
              Sanctuary staff in developing plans to: (1) improve the  management of the
              site's unique long-term data base; (2)  establish a Geographic Information
              System (GIS); and (3) increase  use of the site as a field laboratory for
              Appalachian ecology.  ***
