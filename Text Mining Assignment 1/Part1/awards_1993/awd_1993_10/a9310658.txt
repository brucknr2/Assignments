Abstract    :
              9310658  Kolbas  The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at North
              Carolina State University proposes the purchase of a femtosecond/picosecond Ti
              sapphire pulsed laser system and data acquisition systems.  The system will be
              used to investigate:   1) artificially structured semiconductor materials and
              nanostructures; 2) high speed integrated circuits, and; 3) wide bandgap
              semiconductors.  The equipment would have an immediate impact and would be used
              in several existing research projects which include: 1) carrier scattering and
              phonon participation in semiconductor laser operation; 2) characterization of
              low temperature (A1)GaAs in Integrated Optoelectronic circuits; 3) time
              resolved studies of surface emitting lasers, and; 4) time resolved studies of
              new wide bandgap materials such as SiC and GaN.  The addition of this equipment
              would also make possible future projects in the areas of: 1) ultra-fast
              semiconductor lasers for high speed interconnects; 2) high speed test and
              evaluation of digital circuits with clock rates above 1 GHz, and; 3)
              microcavity lasers and mesoscopic devices.    A significant impact on the
              infrastructure is realized in both the depth and breadth f the proposed
              research because of the synergy with the existing Optical Characterization
              Laboratory and the newly formed (NSF funded) Picosecond Digital Systems
              Laboratory.  ***
