Abstract    :
              This award, in the Small Grants for Exploratory Research mode,                 
              funds an investigation into the potential capabilities of an                   
              omnidirectional vision sensor to provide guidance and control                  
              information for a mobile robot.  The work will explore several                 
              basic questions: (1) can scene interpretation for navigation and               
              object recognition be carried out efficiently on "raw"                         
              omnidirectional images, or is it necessary to compensate for the               
              distortions inherent in such images;  and (2) how best to use image            
              invariants in omnidirectional vision to minimize computation in                
              robotic navigation.  Exploratory error studies and experimental                
              validation of the omnidirectional approach will also be carried                
              out.  Ultimately this research is expected to develop a theoretical            
              foundation for omnidirectional vision control of a mobile robot.
