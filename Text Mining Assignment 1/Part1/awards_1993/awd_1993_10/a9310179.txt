Abstract    :
              This conference deals with the history and practice of Eastern                 
              Arctic archaeology to be held at Dartmouth College, Hanover, N.H.              
              from 29 April to 2 May, 1993. The principal objective of the                   
              conference is to examine the evolution of archeology in this                   
              region, including analyzing the achievements of the past 100                   
              years and identifying and explaining changes in methods and                    
              research goals over time. Major senior scholars, Native peoples,               
              and younger researchers will participate through structured                    
              dialogues which will be submitted for publication to the                       
              Smithsonian Press.
