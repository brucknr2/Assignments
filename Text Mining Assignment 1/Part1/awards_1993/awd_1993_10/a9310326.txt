Abstract    :
              9310326  Chakel  This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project
              deals with the development and  applications of high resolution, high
              mass-accuracy matrix-assisted laser desorption mass  spectrometry (MALD). Both
              high resolution and high mass accuracy have been demonstrated  in the Phase I
              project on a novel triple electrostatic sector time-of-flight mass
              spectrometer.  Many biochemical techniques such as peptide mapping require
              accurate mass assignments to  identify various proteolytic fragments. These
              fragments can be rapidly and unambiguously  identified in a single MALD
              experiment. The Phase II research will develop innovative methods  for
              achieving routine high mass resolution and accuracy measurements of
              biomolecules. Specific  applications illustrating the power of the MALD
              technique for accurate biomolecule analysis will  be developed. The inherent
              sensitivity, speed of analysis and simplicity of MALD analyses will  provide
              major advantages in applications of immediate and valuable use to the clinical
              and  biological research communities.  %%%  This SBIR Phase II project will
              continue the advances initially started in the Phase I project.   An important
              goal of the SBIR Program is the ultimate conversion of NSF-supported research 
              into technological innovation and commercialization.  ***
