Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Widespread concern about the presumed global-scale deterioration of            
              coral reefs mandates the need for documented case histories of the             
              world's coral reefs.  To meet this need, the Colloquium organizers             
              assembled a series of case histories.  Some 50 case histories from             
              22 different countries were selected as examples of the health,                
              hazards and history of reefs.  These case histories were used as               
              the basis for critical review by coral reef scientists at a three-             
              day Colloquium in June 1993.  Based on these case histories, the               
              Colloquium addressed several key questions:  What is the                       
              geographical extent of coral reef deterioration or under stress?               
              How will the expected global warming influence reefs?  How can                 
              natural vs. anthropogenic-induced changes be identified?  Does sea             
              level history explain some of the variations in the vigor of reef              
              communities?  What is the impact of oil spills on coral reefs? How             
              do excess nutrients from land-runoff affect reefs?  Immediately                
              following the Colloquium, an open two-day Forum with keynote                   
              speakers presented the results of this review to the public.                   
              Selected case histories, their review and recommendations from the             
              Colloquium and Forum will be published in the University of Miami              
              Serial Publication.
