Abstract    :
              9310395  Szelenyi    This project is the data-preparation phase of a set of
              large scale  comparative surveys examining the effect of the transformation of 
              Eastern Europe to post-Communism in: Bulgaria, the Czech Republic,  Hungary,
              Poland, Russia, and Slovakia.  In each country, data have  been collected from
              a general population sample of approximately  5,000 persons and a sample of
              2,000 members of the former and  current elite, in order to test theories
              regarding the effect of  the change to post-Communism on recruitment into the
              elite and on  processes of mobility more generally.  The present project will 
              prepare the complex, multi-nation, multi-language data for public  use and will
              begin statistical analysis.  %%%  This research will test several scientific
              theories of social and  political change, as well as providing a rich data set
              that will be  used by many researchers in several different social sciences. 
              In  addition, this project substantially increases the knowledge base  for
              policy decisions concerning the radical transformations  currently in progress
              in these six nations and in the other parts  of the former Soviet bloc.    ***
