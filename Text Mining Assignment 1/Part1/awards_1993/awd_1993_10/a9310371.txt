Abstract    :
              9310371  Klessig  Since 1985 our group has been studying various aspects of 
              pathogenesis related (PR) proteins including their location, their  function in
              disease resistance and their synthesis.  Recent work in  our, as well as
              several other, laboratories strongly suggests that  salicylic acid (SA) plays
              an important signaling role in plant  disease defense responses including the
              induction of PR genes.  We  propose to continue several lines of study to help
              further define  SA's signaling role and identify components of this signal 
              transduction pathway.  In addition to free SA, a glucosidated form  (SAG) is
              found in resistant cultivate of tobacco after infection  with tobacco mosaic
              virus (TMV).  The roles of these two forms of  SA in the development and
              manifestation of systemic acquired  resistance (SAR) will be addressed.  The
              second line of study  involves characterization of the cis element (s) and
              trans-acting  factors which mediate SA-induced transcriptional activation of
              the  acidic PR-2 (glucanase) gene of tobacco.  In the third line of  study
              SA-insensitive (SAIN) mutants of Arabidopsis will be isolated  and
              characterized.  Positive selection of SAIN mutants will utilize  the tms2 gene
              of Agrobacterium tumefaciens fused to the SA-  inducible tobacco PR-1 or PR-2
              promoters.  %%%  These studies should lead to a better understanding of how the
              SA  signal is generated, modified, perceived and transduced during  defense
              responses.  They may also provide insights into the  mechanisms (s) of action
              of other SA-mediated physiological changes  and should provide an opportunity
              to compare signal transduction in  plants with that in microbes and animals.
