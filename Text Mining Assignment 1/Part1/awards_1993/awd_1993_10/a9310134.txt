                      This award supports an 18 month study by the Committee on Japan of the
              National Academy of Sciences (NAS) on the topic "Strategies for Maximizing U.S.
              Interests in Scientific and Technological Relations with Japan."  The result of
              the study will be a report that will integrate findings of previous reports
              with new ideas for consideration by government and the private sector concerned
              with the United States' S&T relations with Japan.  As we look ahead to the 21st
              century, the United States faces significant challenges in its scientific and
              technological relations with Japan.  This study will develop a framework for
              maximizing U.S. interests in competing and cooperating with Japan as a
              technological superpower.  These interests include:  (1) improving global
              competitiveness of U.S. corporations and the United States as a place of high
              value added production; (2) maintaining the U.S. research and technology base;
              and (3) meeting defense requirements in a post cold war context.  The study
              will review current policies and context, highlight long term objectives,
              analyze obstacles to achieving them with detailed references to agency programs
              and missions, clarify alternative future scenarios and their implications for
              U.S. interests, and provide recommendations for steps that government,
              industry, and research institutions could take to maximize long term U.S.
              interests.
