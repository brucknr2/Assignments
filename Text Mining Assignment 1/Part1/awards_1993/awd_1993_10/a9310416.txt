Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A workshop to discuss research opportunities and scientific                    
              challenges in the North Atlantic Current (NAC) where the northern              
              branch of the Gulf Stream separates near the Grand Banks will be               
              held in Woods Hole in the spring of 1993.  The NAC is a little                 
              understood current system, which has major implications on the                 
              interaction between the ocean and atmosphere and for climate                   
              variability.  The output of the workshop will be a scientific                  
              report documenting what is known about the region, outlining the               
              fundamental scientific issues that need to be addressed, and                   
              synthesizing these into specific program goals and an outline of a             
              coordinated research plan.
