Abstract    :
              9310518  Espy-Wilson       This is the first year of a three-year continuing
              award to  investigate speaker variability and a feature-based approach to 
              speech recognition.  The speaker variability study builds from  current
              knowledge to consideration of a spontaneous speech database  with the purpose
              of categorization and modelling for recognition  purposes.  It is anticipated
              that systematic variability will show  in this study and that it may be
              possible to represent it within  the lexical representation of words, easing
              requirements for  training of recognition systems.  The representation of
              phenomena  such as lenition provides an example of the more general possible 
              agreement between a lexical item and its possible acoustic  realizations.  A
              study of speech features in relational terms is  carried out to search for
              sources that may decrease variability and  to disclose the remaining, hopefully
              fewer, factors that may be  central to their correlates in order to facilitate
              feature-based  recognition.
