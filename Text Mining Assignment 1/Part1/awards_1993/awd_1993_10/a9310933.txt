              Reichman Konza Prairie Research Natural Area (KPRNA) is a 3,487 ha tallgrass
              prairie preserve located 15 km south of Manhattan, Kansas that, in 1980, became
              one of the first Long Term Ecological Research sites.  The site, and the LTER
              program itself, have spawned numerous additional research activities which now
              involve 133 projects representing 40 KSU faculty members (from 14 Departments
              and 4 Colleges), 23 visiting scientists, and an additional 13 studies involving
              intersite comparisons between LTER sites.  Konza Prairie has hosted these
              myriad projects for over 10 years without substantially increasing its ability
              to support the efforts.  The site is near its carrying capacity for
              facilitating research, even though many additional researchers are interested
              is working there.  The number of new requests for research permits has climbed
              dramatically over the last decade and the cumulative effect may have reached
              the maximum sustainable by the current facilities.  This project is designed to
              prepare a Master Plan for the expansion of Konza Prairie research capability
              including the renovation of existing facilities, and the construction of new
              laboratory space and living quarters for visiting scientists and students. 
              Concurrently, the management and operational plan and the administrative
              structure will be revised to accommodate the expanded opportunities.  A
              coalition of participants has been organized who have agreed to support the
              implementation of the plan once it is developed.  Currently, the coalition
              consists  of the faculty and students working on Konza Prairie, Kansas State
              University (from the Division to the Dean of Arts and Sciences and the
              Provost), The Nature Conservancy, and KSU Foundation. ***
