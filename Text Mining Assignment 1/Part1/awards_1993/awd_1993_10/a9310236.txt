Abstract    :
              9310236   Scott  Recently, a parallel version of the algorithm has been
              developed  but it has bot been tested on large, physical systems.  We  propose
              to carry out the implementation and testing of such  algorithms.  The proposed
              research will also include the  examination of programming models appropriate
              for this type of  scientific problem.
