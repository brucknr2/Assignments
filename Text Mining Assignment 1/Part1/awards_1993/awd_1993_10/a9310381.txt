Abstract    :
              9310381       The principal investigators propose to continue the  management of
              the Southern California Geometric Analysis Seminar.  The purpose of the seminar
              is to gather together scientists and  graduate students working in the general
              area of Geometric  Analysis for two days of lectures by six distinguished 
              researchers in this area.  Topics covered will be at the  forefront of current
              research and the infrastructural value of  the seminar series is justified.
