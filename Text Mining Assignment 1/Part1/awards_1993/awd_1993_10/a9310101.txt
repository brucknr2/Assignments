Abstract    :
              9310101 Clogg   A five year program of research will be undertaken by the
              investigator to study seven interrelated statistical models for analyzing
              categorical dependent variables in social research.  The objectives of the
              research are to: (1) Apply Rasch type models of the latent class variety to
              panel data so that unobserved heterogeneity can be characterized without extra
              assumptions about the form of the left out factors creating unmodeled
              variation; (2) Further developments in latent class analysis and measurement
              models; (3) Create new models and methods for regression with an ordinal
              dependent variable; (4) Generate models and methods for regression with a
              partially ordered Y; (5) Explore a new index of model fit based on mixture
              methods, with applications to social research; (6) Improve prediction methods
              associated with latent class models and apply these new prediction methods to
              graphic models; and (7) Model "total uncertainty" in statistical models used in
              social research.  %%% This research program will generate and improve tools for
              a more rigorous empirical analysis in social research and provide results which
              will be of general interest to those in statistics and other areas. ***
