Abstract    :
              Lawrence Kool    9310198    This is an attempt to develop a method to convert
              alkanes directly  to partially oxidized products using a platinum catalyst and
              an  aqueous  transition-metal oxidant.  The approach differs from  currently
              available methods in that it does not require molecular  oxygen.  This effort
              includes a critical evaluation of the  platinum/aqueous ferric system covering
              experimental variables,  selectivity at high conversion, and elucidation of the
              mechanism,  which is thought to involve an alkylplatinum hydride intermediate; 
              catalyst support effects; substitution of palladium for platinum;  the use of
              various aqueous transition-metal oxidants; and the  design, synthesis, and
              evaluation of soluble organoplatinum  complexes that may model the
              carbon-hydrogen bond cleavage on the  platinum surface.    Direct partial
              oxidation of light alkanes (methane, propane,  natural gas, etc.) is an
              important objective of catalytic  technology; current methods are either very
              limited in scope or are  cumbersome multistep processes.  The products of such
              processes,  such as methanol, ethanol, formaldehyde, acetic acid, etc., have 
              many uses as chemical feedstocks, fuels, or monomers, or they can  be further
              processed to improve existing fuels.  Although there is  much work toward this
              objective, the approach in this work is a  radical departure from conventional
              efforts.  This is a  collaboration with A. E. Shilov at the Institute of
              Chemical  Physics in Chernogolovka, Russia.
