Abstract    :
              9310154  Bourne  The macromolecular crystallography community has recently
              adopted  a standard set of data definitions as extension to that subset 
              already derived for small molecule crystallography and referred  to as the
              Crystallographic Information File (CIF).   Macromolecular CIF definitions will
              facilitate the highly  desireable features of simpler information exchange and
              a rich  controlled vocabulary for use world-wide by scientists in an  expanding
              discipline.  Speedy adoption of CIF requires flexible,  interoperable, and
              portable software tools.  The investigators  will build a class library and a
              set of tools based on the  object-oriented software technology to browse, edit,
              display,  query, verify and format CIF files, called CIFters.  In addition, 
              CIFters will be callable from existing programs in common use in 
              macromolecular crystallography facilitating access to CIF files,  further
              promoting the use of CIF.  The long term goal of this  project is to develop
              extensible software tools which are widely  available to the structural biology
              community.  In addition, this  award support an end-user workshop to begin the
              effort to design  the appropriate CIFters.  ***
