Abstract    :
              9310428  Dahl             This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and
              Organometallic   Chemistry Program provides continued support for research on  
              transition metal carbonyl cluster compounds by Dr. Lawrence F.   Dahl of the
              Chemistry Department, University of   Wisconsin-Madison.  A major goal is to
              provide a unified   correlation between molecular geometries and electronic  
              configuration for various kinds of metal clusters, many of   which gain or lose
              electrons without rupture of their atomic   frameworks.  Research will be
              focused in two areas:  1)   isolation, structural determination, and
              physical-chemical   characterization of high nuclearity platinum, nickel, and  
              mixed-metal carbonyl clusters; and 2) synthesis,   stereochemical-bonding
              analysis, and electrochemical reactivity   of small electron-rich metal
              clusters.  Rational methods for   preparing large clusters and appropriate
              separation techniques   to isolate and crystallize pure species for
              characterization   remain to be developed.  In addition to determining the  
              structure of these complexes, their magnetic properties and   modes of carbon
              monoxide adsoption will be investigated.  The   reactivity of metal clusters
              with main group reagents, which   may be able to stabilize the species, will
              also be studied.    Attempts will be made to isolate metal phosphide and metal 
               arsenic clusters with novel bonding features.  %%%  Large metal clusters that
              can be characterized using standard   chemical methods may be useful models for
              understanding the   behavior of solid metal surfaces or lattice fragments,
              which   are often used in catalysis.  Of particular interest are    reactivity
              characteristics and electronic features.  The work   may result in materials
              that are effective as catalysts or in   the improvement of reaction conditions
              or surface preparation   of catalytic materials currently in industrial use.
