Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT -- CTS-93-10146  Herman    The objective of the proposed research is
              the experimental investigation of convective single-phase and flow boiling heat
              transfer enhancement by combined resonant excitation of Tollmien-Schlichting
              instabilities and seeding the flow with bubbles applied to the direct immersion
              liquid cooling of electronic equipment. The resonant excitation is achieved by
              inserting cylinders in cross flow periodically above the downstream edge of
              electronic component rows. The same cylinders are used to inject bubbles into
              the flow. The mechanism of heat transfer on (i) the basic geometry without
              cylinders, (ii) the enhanced geometry with cylinders and (iii) the enhanced
              geometry with cylinders used for seeding the flow. Holographic interferometry
              will be used to visualize the unsteady temperature fields and measure local
              heat transfer coefficients. Also, the overall heat transfer coefficient and
              pressure drop will be measured.
