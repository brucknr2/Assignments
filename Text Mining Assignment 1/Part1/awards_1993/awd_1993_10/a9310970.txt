Abstract    :
              9310970  Cruickshank       The 1993 Gordon Research Conference on Atmospheric
              Chemistry  will be held at Salve Regina University in Newport, Rhode Island, 
              with technical sessions from June 21 through June 25, 1993.  The  theme of the
              conference will be "Predicting Atmospheric Change".       The conference will
              address several timely and interrelated  aspects of atmospheric chemistry
              involving regional, continental  and global scale processes in both the
              troposphere and  stratosphere.  Relevant atmospheric processes include
              photochemical  pollution, tropospheric oxidative capacity, acid formation and 
              deposition, greenhouse gas build-up, cloud and aerosol effects on  chemistry
              and radiation, biogeochemical cycling of trace  atmospheric species and
              stratospheric ozone depletion.  ***
