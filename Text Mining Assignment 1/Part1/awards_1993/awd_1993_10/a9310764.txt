                                            ABSTRACT    PHY-9310764  Karl Berkelman  Cornell
              University    This project supports a program of basic research in Elementary 
              Particle Physics and Accelerator Physics at the Laboratory of  Nuclear Studies
              of Cornell University. The research program  includes the operation of, and
              accelerator studies on, the  Cornell Electron Storage Ring (CESR), research on
              the CLEO-II  detector, and provides, parasitically, synchrotron radiation 
              beams for the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS). The  CESR
              accelerator, an electron-positron colliding beam facility  optimized to produce
              hadron final states in the 9 to 12 GeV  range, delivers a yearly integrated
              luminosity far exceeding  other similar machines.  CESR is a test-bed for many
              accelerator  physics studies; the Cornell group leads the world in the 
              production of accelerator physicists.  The center-of-mass energy  range of CESR
              includes the Upsilon(4S) resonance which decays  100% of the time into a pair
              of B-mesons, enabling very clean  studies of bottom quark decays with the CLEO
              II detector.  The  collider also produces copious numbers of charm mesons and
              tau  leptons simultaneously, allowing a broad range of physics topics  to be
              studied.
