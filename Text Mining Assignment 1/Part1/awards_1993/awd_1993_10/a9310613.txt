Abstract    :
              9310613  Lu  In this proposal we present a research program that aims at
              answering the challenge of ULSI metalizations by adopting a new approach to
              applying metallization using a very practical technology.  We propose to
              investigate the epitaxial metal contacts to GaAs and InP, formed using
              partially ionized beam deposition technique.  This technique offers surface
              self-cleaning, low temperature epitaxial deposition, excellent control on
              composition of the alloys to be deposited, and all of this in a non UHV
              deposition chamber.  The metallizations to be investigated are epitaxial films
              of Al, CoSi2, Co2P, Ge2Co, and A12Pt.  These metal and alloy films are
              carefully selected to satisfy our needs of stable metallization with the best
              chance to form them epitaxially on GaAs and InP.  The deposition,
              characterization including process stability, and applicability will be
              determined.  The most promising scheme will then be used to fabricate a MESFET
              on GaAs and/or InP.  ***
