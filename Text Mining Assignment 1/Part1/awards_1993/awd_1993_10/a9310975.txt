Abstract    :
              This project is the renewal of a study of the vertical flux and the            
              rate of dissolution of biogenic silica in the water column of the              
              Ross Sea, and is part of a coordinated study of the biogenic silica            
              and organic carbon cycling in the water column and the sediments of            
              the Ross Sea.  The antarctic deep sea and continental shelf                    
              environment is the major repository for silica accumulation in the             
              global ocean, and dominates the global silica budget.  The Ross Sea            
              is a particularly anomalous area in which large amounts of biogenic            
              silica are accumulating in modern sediments, while the surface                 
              production rates are generally below the global average.  Moreover             
              the usual similarity between the oceanic silicon and carbon cycle              
              does not appear to hold around Antarctica, and the two cycles are              
              decoupled in that the rate of particulate carbon deposition in the             
              modern sediment is very low.  The overall project is an integrated             
              study of the production, vertical transport, dissolution, and                  
              deposition processes, using moored instrumentation and direct                  
              observations in a series of transects in the Ross Sea by R/V POLAR             
              DUKE, carried out between 1989 and 1991.                                       
                                                                                             
              The vertical flux and dissolution rates were measured by deploying             
              time-series sediment traps at two depths on each of three moorings             
              for a period of fourteen months.  In conjunction with                          
              transmissometers and current meter arrays, these moorings will                 
              allow the measurement and characterization of both vertical and                
              horizontal fluxes of particulate matter during a complete annual               
              cycle of production and sedimentation.  The objectives of this                 
              renewal are to recover one sediment trap that was redeployed for an            
              additional two years, to complete the analysis of all water column             
              and sediment trap samples that are currently in hand, and to                   
              produce a synthesis of all project data sets in cooperation with               
              the other investigators cooperating in this project.
