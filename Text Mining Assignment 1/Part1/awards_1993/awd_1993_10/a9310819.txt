Abstract    :
              9310819  Mooney       A general goal of machine learning is automating the 
              construction of efficient knowledge-based systems.  Current methods  tend to
              focus on either the acquisition of the basic domain  knowledge (inductive
              learning) or the acquisition of search-control  knowledge (speedup learning). 
              However, these two tasks are not  always cleanly separated.  This research
              investigates the general  framework of learning search-control heuristics for
              logic programs,  which can improve both accuracy and efficiency.  Logic
              programming  provides a very general and well-understood representational and 
              computational platform on which to build.  Recent methods in  inductive logic
              programming can be used to automatically learn  search-control heuristics from
              a set of training problems.   Efficiency may be improved by learning control
              rules that eliminate  backtracking during the search for a proof.  Accuracy may
              be  improved by learning control rules that eliminate search paths that 
              produce incorrect results.
