Abstract    :
              This award supports the operation of the PALE Steering Committee               
              for the Paleoclimate of Arctic Lakes and Estuaries (PALE)                      
              initiative as part of Arctic Systems Science (ARCSS).  The Steering            
              Committee will develop science and management plans for this                   
              program and will be active in the implementation of the research               
              activities.  Pale is entering a critical phase of data collection,             
              synthesis and interpretation.  This award will support 1) annual               
              meetings of PALE researchers for the exchange and synthesis of                 
              results, 2) small workshops to address specific research needs, and            
              3) Steering Committee efforts to coordinate projects and maintain              
              communication among PALE researchers.
