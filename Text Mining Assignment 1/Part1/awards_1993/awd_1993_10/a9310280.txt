Abstract    :
              The purpose of this research is to analyze the effects of various              
              social insurance programs on the behavior of individuals and                   
              firms.  The programs to be studied include Unemployment Insurance              
              (UI), Worker's Compensation (WC), and Aid to Families with                     
              Dependent Children (AFDC).  The study of the UI program will                   
              provide a better understanding about  how the level of benefits                
              effects the chance of an individual of filing and the length of                
              time the person receives assistance.  The WC  program will be                  
              analyzed to determine the extent to which the reporting of                     
              nonwork injuries are effected by the level of benefits and other               
              features of state workers' compensation systems.  The AFDC study               
              includes an examination of the duration of claims using                        
              administrative data.  In addition, welfare migration among states              
              will also be examined.  Part of this project will also include                 
              assembling, documenting, and disseminating some new and                        
              potentially extremely useful data sets pertaining to                           
              participation in these various social insurance programs.
