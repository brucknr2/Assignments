Abstract    :
              9310926  Pugh    This proposal is a Research Planning Grant proposal in the 
              Minority Research Initiation (MRI) Program.  The PI intends to  develop a
              research proposal and to develop his proposal writing  skills.  The prime
              objectives of the planned proposal are to use  the laser Raman spectroscopy to
              collect structural information  from glasses, polymers, and ceramic materials. 
              The PI hopes to  use these data to develop better quality new materials.  %%% 
              This MRI project intends to develop a research proposal to be  submitted for
              funding support.  Its prime objectives are to  collect structural information
              about glasses, polymers, and  ceramic materials, with the use of laser Raman
              spectrocscopy.  These result can be used to provide ideals for developing new 
              materials of better qualities.  ***
