Abstract    :
              9310374  Case       Parasites maybe responsible for the maintenance of 
              reproductive patterns, "Red Queen" hypothesis.  In some systems  asexuals have
              significantly more parasites than sexuals, but pilot  data for the current
              studies show just the opposite pattern.   However, it is impossible to use such
              data as a direct test of the  Red Queen hypothesis since a variety of
              mechanisms, such as  parasite transmission dynamics and virulence, can shape
              patterns of  parasite distribution in the wild.  The Red Queen hypothesis
              generates predictions about which  mechanisms must be important in
              host/parasite interactions in order  for asexuals to be favored:  i) host
              susceptibility must be the  most important determinant of parasite distribution
              in a  population; ii) host susceptibility must be genetically determined;  and
              iii) host susceptibility must be frequency-dependent, with the  most common
              genotype becoming the most susceptible over time.  The  current study will
              experimentally test these predictions in the  sexual/asexual gecko system.  %%%
               Understanding the maintenance & development of major demographic  properties,
              such as mode of reproduction among species, is a major  goal of population
              biology.  However, theory predicting that  parthenogenetic forms are rare
              because they are more susceptible to  parasites has largely remained untested
              in complex ecological  situations.  The present research takes an ecological
              perspective  to a fundamental problem in evolutionary biology.  ***
