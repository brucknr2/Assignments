Abstract    :
              9310480  Park  We propose to conduct an interdisciplinary research program that 
              will address modeling and computational issues that intervene in  the
              development of optimization methods for massively actuated  structures(MAS)
              designs.  These issues include:  efficient analysis  of control-structure
              interaction on massively parallel machines by  coupled-field partitioning and
              subdomain decomposition; concurrent  calculation of performance indices and
              their sensitivity  derivatives for use by the optimizer; and, novel search
              methods for  maximizing performance indices with respect to actuator location 
              and control gains. The techniques will be applied to two specific  problems: 
              arresting aeroelastic oscillations of a transonic-  hypersonic wing whose shape
              may be controlled through embedded  piezoelectric devices, and performance
              optimization of a turbine  blade with embedded with low and high-authority
              actuators over a  range of propulsion regimes.
