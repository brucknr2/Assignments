Abstract    :
              The Longitudinal Study of American Youth (LSAY) began to follow                
              probability samples of 7th and 10th graders in 1987, in order to               
              determine student skills and knowledge in science and mathematics.             
              In addition, the survey has gathered detailed information on                   
              student attitudes toward these subjects and toward possible careers            
              in science, mathematics, engineering, and medicine, on parental                
              attitudes and influences, and on aspects of schooling and the                  
              community that may affect student mastery and attitude.  The                   
              present grant provides funds for further research on the original              
              cohorts, taking them into college age, and supports additional                 
              analyses for interpretation of the evidence accumulated to date.
