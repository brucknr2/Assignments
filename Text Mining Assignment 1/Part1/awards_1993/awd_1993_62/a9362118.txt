Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT -- III-9362118  PI:  GREENWALD    Evaluations of the use of laser diode
              arrays focused directly onto the work piece for rapid heating of materials was
              proposed.  Laser diode arrays are much smaller and more efficient than flash
              lamps or other electrically powered laser, such as CO2.  An instrument the size
              of a hot  air blower could deliver over ten kilowatts of light energy for
              hardening the surface of alloys in structures such as boats or planes, or a
              smaller instrument could be run over the surface of an intricate piece without
              the elaborate set up now required on large laser systems.    In Phase I the use
              of waveguide focusing will be used to bring the 1 MW/cm2 light intensity
              available at the output of each laser in the array to a common homogenous beam.
               A small, mobile instrument will be fabricated to apply the light beam so
              generated to altering polymer surface properties, hardening tool steels and
              ceramics used for cutting, improving wear of bearings and biomedical implants,
              and oxide reflow on semiconductor circuits.  In Phase II the wavelength and
              array size will be optimized to match specific applications which appear
              feasible from Phase I tests.
