              Foveal Machine Vision for Mobile Robots Using Agent Based Gaze Control         
              An attention mechanism can influence system behavior and performance only to
              the extent to which system resources are allocatable.  A key robot visual
              system resource is acuity, and yet this is fixed in conventional uniform acuity
              machine vision; regions with little or no relevance t o the robot's mission are
              sampled at the same resolution as key features, occupying valuable signal
              bandwidth and computational resources, and increasing system latencies.  Foveal
              active vision features imaging sensors and signal processing with graded
              acuity, and context sensitive sensor gaze control, analogous to that prevalent
              throughout vertebrate vision.  Foveal systems operate more efficiently because
              resolution is treated as a dynamically allocatable resource.  Wide field of
              view, localized high acuity, and fast frame rates are achieved while minimizing
              irrelevant sensor data.  This research project will prototype a mobile robot
              foveal vision system which relies on an agent based, grounded, layered
              architecture with integrated reasoning for gaze control.  This architecture
              will facilitate the development of successful active vision behaviors (sensor
              pointing and platform motion).  Learning techniques will be investigated which
              accelerate attentive active vision behaviors by evolving them into preattentive
              responses.   #    x   \        P    C      X P#
