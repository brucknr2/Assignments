Abstract    :
              9362058  Bochner  Anaerobic bacteria possess metabolic activities for
              biodegrading a  range of polluting chemicals including aromatic chemicals, 
              halogenated aromatics, and halogenated alkenes.  Anaerobes make up  a
              significant portion of terrestrial bacteria and should be  considered as
              potential agents of bioremediation, but our knowledge  of these organisms,
              their diversity, taxonomy, and metabolic  capabilities, is still at a
              rudimentary level.  An efficient, easy-  to-use, instrumented test kit system
              that can be used both to study  the catabolic capabilities of anaerobes and to
              identify different  species of anaerobes based on those capabilities will be
              developed.  The catabolic potential of over 300 species of anaerobes against 
              nearly 200 organic chemicals will be surveyed and cataloged.  From  computer
              analysis of this data, a set of 95 carbon source  utilization tests will be
              selected that ultimately will be  incorporated into a commercial microplate
              test kit.    %%%  The survey will provide an overview of the range of 
              catabolic activities of anaerobes, and the instrumented test kit  system will
              be marketed commercially to microbiologists doing  environmental, industrial,
              and medical testing and identification  of anaerobes.  ***
