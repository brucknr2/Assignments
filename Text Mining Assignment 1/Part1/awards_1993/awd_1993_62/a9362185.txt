Abstract    :
              9362185  Proudfoot       Intelligent interface agents greatly increase the
              suitability  of computer technology for use by the broader population in 
              performing simple, human-oriented tasks.  Effective intelligent  agents can be
              built using memory-based processing.  This research  involves the application
              of memory-based convention, intention, and  domain knowledge to handle simple
              scripts accessible from the  telephone.  This Phase I proposal concentrates on
              recording and  integrating this knowledge to provide an intelligent agent for
              the  voice dialing telephone service.  Convention and domain knowledge  will be
              represented in conversational scripts.  Interactions with  the system will be
              stored in dynamic memory both as lexical sensory  data and episodic conceptual
              structures.  These interactions will  include typed natural language and typed
              and keyed DTMF and silence  tokens.  Wherever possible, existing modules and
              representations  will be used for processing natural language, dynamic memory, 
              reasoning, and conversation control.
