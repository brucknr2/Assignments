Abstract    :
              9362108  Arlinghaus       We propose to demonstrate the potential applicability
              of the  sputter-initiated resonance ionization microprobe (SIRIMP)  technique
              for geological studies by measuring Pb isotope ratios and  U/Pb atomic ratios
              in geological samples relevant to geochronology.   SIRIMP is based on the
              concept of resonance ionization of sputtered  atoms and potentially offers
              several advantages over conventional  high-resolution ion microprobe
              instruments.  The most important of  these are the high selectivity,
              significant reduction of isobaric  interferences and matrix effects, and
              notable reduction in  instrument cost.  Preliminary research will be required
              in order   (a) assess interferences due to unsuppressed ions created in the 
              sputtering process (secondary ions) and those created by  nonresonant
              photoionization and evaluate methods for their  elimination, and (b)
              experimentally identify and evaluate resonant  ionization schemes for Pb and U.
               Results from the proposed  research will provide the basis for the development
              of new state-  of-the-art analytical methods which would significantly advance 
              analytical capabilities in earth sciences and promote new areas of  research. 
              These benefits could extend to other areas such as the  semiconductor industry,
              the biomedical field, and environmental  sciences.
