Abstract    :
                      9362197  DOUGLASS  This project will to use a low altitude,
              polar-orbiting,  data collection satellite platform, in conjunction with 
              commercial communication satellites, to provide direct  worldwide recovery and
              distribution of data from in-situ  instrumentation platforms.  It also provides
              a command link  for remote control of the untended platforms.  This project 
              offers an affordable approach to greatly improved polar  telescience.  It will
              significantly increase communication  capacity and reduce delays in data
              recovery for deployed  systems.  The overall objective of the program is to 
              increase the daily data throughput capability by a factor of  100 or more,
              compared to existing systems.  The anticipated  total system cost makes it
              feasible to develop the system  with private sector financing and operate it on
              a a fee-for-  service basis.  The Phase I study will (1) examine user 
              requirements, (2) develop a system specification, (3)  prepare a preliminary
              design of the sensor platform and  satellite equipment, (4) perform a cost
              effectiveness  analysis, including budgetary life cycle costs, and (5)  develop
              a Phase II plan for system development, simulation,  and demonstration.  The
              study will emphasize minimization of  total system complexity and costs by
              using simple sensor  platform communication packages, low cost development 
              options, proven satellite components, and existing, proven  comsat systems for
              data distribution.  ***
