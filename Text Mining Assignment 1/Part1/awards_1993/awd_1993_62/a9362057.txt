Abstract    :
              9362057  Bochner  There is a growing recognition of the need to care for our
              ocean environments and to prevent or at least minimize chemical pollution
              introduced by man.  Marine bacteria play a key role by initiating the recycling
              metabolic good chain of the oceans.  However, our knowledge of these organisms,
              their diversity, taxonomy, and metabolic capabilities, is still at a
              rudimentary level.  In this project, Biolog, Inc. proposes to develop a simple
              and rapid instrumented system for characterizing and identifying a broad range
              of heterotrophic, mesophilic marine bacteria or mixed populations of marine
              microorganisms.  The system will be composed of microplate test kits which can
              be read and analyzed by an existing computer-controlled reading instrument.  A
              second goal of this proposed research program is to collect and analyze data on
              the metabolic capabilities of microbial populations indigenous to ocean
              environments.  The fundamental scientific insights gained in the proposed study
              should aid in the development of strategies for preserving, enhancing, and/or
              directing the metabolism of marine bacteria for preservation or reclamaton of
              marine habitat.  The instrumented test kit system will be marketed to marine
              and fishery organizations and research institutes and to commercial fish and
              shellfish farming operations.
