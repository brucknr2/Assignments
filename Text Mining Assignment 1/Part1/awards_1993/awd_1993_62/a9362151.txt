Abstract    :
              9362151  Podany       A new high resolution paint spraying technology suitable
              for  industrial, robotic applications is to be investigated.  This  technology
              would facilitate the automated application of uniform  coatings for decorative
              and functional painting as well as  eliminate tedious manual mask and spray
              techniques currently used  in industry.  The project will investigate the use
              of an applicator  as a precision paint spraying or coating device for robotic 
              applications and will have as its objectives the development of a  model of the
              applicator suitable for computerized robot path  planning.  Specific objectives
              are the characterization of the  applicator's spray pattern, volumetric spray
              characteristics, spray  velocity, and resulting coating characteristics, i.e.
              thickness and  uniformity, as functions of atomization and fluid pressure, the 
              nozzle, electronic control of the coating feed, and geometric  parameters such
              as applicator distance, angle, and velocity.       This applicator would reduce
              industry costs and environmental  hazards while the precise, uniform
              application of functional and  decorative coatings would allow the automation
              of certain manual,  tedious coating tasks previously thought difficult, if not 
              impossible, to automate.
