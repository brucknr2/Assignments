Abstract    :
              9362048  Liu  Because of the discovery of Er-doped fiber amplifier (EDFA), the
              use of optical fibers optimized for 1550 nm in telecommunication networks is
              gaining favor as a method of adding capacity, providing longer communication
              links and system economy.  For similar reasons 1550 nm systems also are being
              considered for new local exchange networks intended to add routing diversity to
              high-speed computer networks.  With these all-optical networks, the soon to be
              reached electronics speed bottleneck which uses time-domain partitioning can be
              avoided.  Since the bandwidth, or the information carrying capacity of Er-doped
              fiber amplifier (EDFA) is about 30 nm at 1550 nm, wavelength-division
              multiplexing can fit 150, 0.1 nm channels within this bandwidth (number of
              channels = finesse/2).  To take advantage of this EDFA capacity, there is a
              need for an inexpensive, high speed, wide range tunable optical filter.  We
              propose an optical tunable filter for optimally taking advantage of
              wavelength-division multiplexing in the photonic-network which has high
              throughput, large tuning range, high resolution, and high modulation speed.
