Abstract    :
              93621117  Mehra  Fabrication of Metal Matrix Composites (MMC) requires the use
              of  sophisticated manufacturing processes.  One such process is Hot  Isostatic
              Pressing (HIP) which is becoming a key technology for  consolidating MMC
              airframe structural panels for advanced  aircraft.  The objective of proposed
              effort is to develop a  hierarchical two level adaptive optimizing controller
              using,  techniques of Modern Control Theory, System Identification and  Neural
              Networks.  The Level 2 controller minimizes the ultimate  cost per unit of
              production and the Level 1 controller regulates  the HIP process to achieve
              optimal temperature and pressure  profiles dictated by the Level 2 controller. 
              Phase I research  includes (i) a State-of-The-Art survey (ii) identification of
               Level 1 process models from real data (iii) the design of an  adaptive Model
              Predictive Controller (MPC) (iv) testing of the  MPC controller and (v)
              development of architecture for Level 2  controller.  IBIS Associates, a leader
              in the field of materials  technology will provide subcontract support. 
              Industrial  Materials Technologies (IMT), the largest HIP consolidator in the 
              world, has indicated their willingness for supporting the Phase I  effort.
