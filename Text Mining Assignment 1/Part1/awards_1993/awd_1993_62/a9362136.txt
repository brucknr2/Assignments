Abstract    :
              9362136  Sherman    An important kind of powders for producing advanced
              materials are  of a fine size (less than 30 microns, corresponding to Geldart 
              class C powders) cohesive and difficult to fluidize.     Applications of
              coatings or surface modifications of these powders  by fluidization at elevated
              temperature may produce undesirable  hard agglomerates.  Operating a fluidized 
              bed above transport  limit (fast fluidization) or in the turbulent fluidization
              region  may enable class C powders, to be fluidized with high product  yields. 
              In this Phase I of the project, Ultrament will demonstrate  the  feasibility of
              using a fast-fluidized or turbulent fluidized  bed for the application of
              coatings to fine particles and whiskers.       This will allow the production
              of improved starting materials for  powder metallurgy, ceramic, and composite
              materials, as well as  improved conductive fillers, reinforcements, and
              electronic  materials.  ***
