Abstract    :
              9362052  Pishko  The objective of this project is to determine  whether the use
              of  titanium dioxide to coat ceramic and metal  substrates is an  effective way
              to use its photocatalytic  properties for oxidation  of air pollutants produced
              by combustion of  hydrocarbons.   Alternative methods for applying titanium to 
              surfaces are being  investigated to determine the appropriate  method of
              application,  half-life of the coating, and photoactivity  associated with each
               coating method.    This is a Phase I award based on a proposal  submitted in
              response  to NSF 93-18, Small Business Innovation  Research (SBIR) Program 
              Solicitation.  Results are expected to  provide the basis for use  of this
              technology in reducing pollution of  air in air  circulating systems of homes,
              commercial  buildings and airplanes.
