Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT -- III-9362183  Guha    The focus of this proposal is to develop a
              reaction based model which predicts Plasma Initiated Self Propagating High
              Temperature Synthesis (PSHS) process parameters in order to control such
              properties as particle shape, size morphology etc. of the resulting fine
              particles.  The proposed work includes both an experimental and modeling
              components.  Two systems are proposed to be investigated and include the
              intermetallics Ni-Al and Ti-Al.  In-situ m and detailed micro structural
              characterization of the resulting powders will be carried out.
