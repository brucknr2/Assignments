Abstract    :
              9362149  Rogers  The goal of this project is to develop an improved model  which
              will relate the biological activity of a compound to  its physicochemical
              properties.  This area of research is  known as Quantitative Structure-Activity
              Relationship (QSAR)  analysis.  The QSAR is a tool which can be used by
              chemists  in drug design to help reduce the current high level of  testing in
              drug development.  The approach to model  development in this proposed research
              is based on the  Genetic Function Approximation (GFA) algorithm.  The GFA 
              would replace the standard regression analysis normally used  in the QSAR task.
               The objective is to construct higher-  quality predictive models, even with
              data sets that may have  thousands of parameters.  ***
