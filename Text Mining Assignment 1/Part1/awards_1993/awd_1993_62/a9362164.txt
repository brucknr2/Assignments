Abstract    :
              9362164  DIERBERG    Remote sensing is used in a large number of environmental 
              investigations, including water quality assessments.  Most of the  data
              acquired for water quality are from satellite platforms, which  contain sensors
              that provide images using wide bandwidths. The use  of narrow, correctly
              positioned, spectral bands in current airborne  sensing devices as well as in a
              new generation of sensors planned  for satellites will simplify formulation of
              water quality  algorithms.  If simple, accurate, reproducible and sensitive 
              algorithms applicable to a wide range of coastal and inland waters  can be
              developed, then using remote sensing will become not only  easier and more
              reliable, but also more affordable and rapid due to  the reduction of data
              volume, increased integration times, and  facilitated image analysis.  The
              "operationalization" of remote  sensing for monitoring water quality conditions
              will become closer  to reality.     In the present investigation, algorithms
              representing spectral  energy from single bandwidths, ratios of bandwidths, and
              line  heights found to be highly correlated with chlorophyll a,  turbidity, and
              suspended solids for inland waters will be tested in  tow coastal ecosystems,
              the Indian River Lagoon and Tampa Bay. It   looks promising that even in the
              absence of precise optical  characteristics for an environment, it may be
              possible to simulate  that environment from previous ground truthing and derive
              fixed-  wing transportable coefficients.
