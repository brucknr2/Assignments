Abstract    :
              9362155  Lee      No algorithms exist that generate comprehensive, statistically
              sound reliability information for neural networks.  Reliability of neural nets
              is affected by (1) the amount of training data, (2) input novelty, (3) data
              consistency and (4) time-varying system dynamics.  Confidence measures con
              gauge network reliability by indication when sufficient training data has been
              presented for good generalization, when a neural network's output should be
              trusted, and when periodic retraining should occur in slow time-varying dynamic
              systems.  They can also help automate neural network controllers in a
              closed-loop environment.  Confidence generation algorithms complement virtually
              all neural nets and can help their integration with existing controllers into
              production environments. Unica will develop and test confidence algorithms for
              each of the four independent factors affecting reliability.  This research will
              be based on established theories and innovative ideas, using artificial and
              real-world data from "Alcoa's aluminum reduction process.  The principal
              investigator, Yuchun Lee, along with neural network expert, Dr. Richard
              Lippmann of  MIT Lincoln Laboratory, provide the perfect combination of
              real-world application exposure and theoretical background to conduct this
              research.  Successful results are expected to have great commercial potential
              for incorporation into neural network-based process control applications.  ***
