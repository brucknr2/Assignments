Abstract    :
              9362043  Hodko  The objective of this project is to evaluate the feasibility of 
              soil and aquifer decontamination by application of nonhomogeneous  pulsed DC
              and AC electric fields of different frequencies and  amplitudes paying
              particular attention to the complex physical  and chemical situation
              encountered in soil and aquifer  environments.  Laboratory scale experiments
              will be conducted to  determine appropriate electrical regimes for maximum
              removal  rates; the work will include the use of real soil samples.  The 
              experiment of design will seek to bring about electrokinetically-  induced
              electroosmotic flux and pH gradients in advantageous  ways.    This is a Phase
              I award based on a proposal submitted in response  to NSF 93-18, Small Business
              Innovation Research (SBIR) Program  Solicitation.  Results are expected to
              identify conditions under  which the method could be used either as a primary
              or secondary  technology for the treatment of underground formations 
              contaminated with hazardous organic wastes.  The attractiveness  and commercial
              potential of this subsurface treatment is based  primarily on the fact that
              this technology is an in situ  technology targeting organic contaminants in
              various physical  phases, especially the immiscible phase.
