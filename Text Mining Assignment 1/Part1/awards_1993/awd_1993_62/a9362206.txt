Abstract    :
                  9362206  Small    Fluorescence methods are used throughout a variety of
              fields including biotechnology,  microscopy, immunology, biology, chemistry,
              photochemistry and photophysics.  Many  fluorescence techniques employ changes
              in fluorescence intensity of chromophores in  response to their molecular
              environment.  Their goal is to correlate fluorescence  intensity (an arbitrary
              value) with fluorescence quantum yield (a fundamental  photophysical parameter,
              but one that is difficult to measure).    Our objective is to determine the
              feasibility of using a pulsed-laser photoacoustic method  combined with
              fluorescence detection to accurately determine fluorescence quantum  yields. 
              Such a determination should be possible with relatively inexpensive 
              instrumentation, and sufficient automation to make quantum yield determinations
              rapid  and easy to perform.    In our instrument a pulsed-laser beam excites a
              solution of molecules, a light detector  measures fluorescence, and a
              piezoelectric transducer is used to determine the amplitude  of a compressive
              sound wave resulting from heat deposited in the solution. Yields of  triplet
              states will be distinguished because such states are long lived. To support the
               automation of this technique, methods are proposed for determining the average
              emitted  photon energy without resorting to a complete fluorescence spectral
              measurement.  ***
