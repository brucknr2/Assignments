Abstract    :
              9362087  Leaskey    There is much currently great demand for a material with
              superior mechanical properties that can be maintained to high temperatures. 
              Silicon nitride has  been identified as one of the most promising ceramics to
              meet these material requirements.  To date, research on Si3N4 ceramics has
              resulted in superior room temperature properties but retention of these
              properties to high temperatures has not been achieved.  This is mainly a result
              of liquid phase incorporated for densification and grain growth, but which
              remains as a glassy grain boundary phase which softens at high temperatures.   
              A Novel method is proposed which allows for densification and microstructural
              control of Si3N4 without deterimental glassy phases.  This technique involves
              use of a transient liquid phase which is subsequently converted to refractory
              oxides so that no phases with melting points < 1850 C are present.   Also, any
              silica present on the surface of the Si4N4 particles should be converted to
              SiC.  This will result in materials with substantially improved creep
              resistance capable of operation at higher temperatures.    The proposed
              research involves extensive characterization of consolidated materials in terms
              of phase analyses and examination of microstructures.  The mechanical
              properties of optimized samples will be measured at RT and 1400 C.
