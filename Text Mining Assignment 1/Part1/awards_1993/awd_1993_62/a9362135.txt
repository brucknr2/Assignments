Abstract    :
              9362135  Duraiswami       Optimization in ship system design is a problem which,
               if properly formulated and solved, would have great economic  impact. 
              However, the problem cannot be easily cast  mathematically as a classical
              single objective optimization  problem.  In ship system design a considerable
              number of  criteria must be satisfied of which some can only be  formulated in
              fuzzy terms.  This is particularly true in  modeling/simulating ship
              maneuverability, where the  adequateness of a simulator can only be judged by
              consulting  a ship master/pilot.       To build a successful ship simulator,
              the equations of  ship motion must be identified.  This systems identification 
              problem is ill-posed.  In the proposed research we tackle  the problem of
              developing a framework for optimizing design,  by incorporating in the
              procedure the mathematical  simulation and identification of ship dynamics in
              real time.  The ill-posed problem will be formulated using multiple  physical
              constraints/objectives, and solved via pareto-  optimization.  Efficient
              computer programs implementing our  theory and algorithms will be developed.   
                 Phase I research will develop an inexpensive prototype  ship maneuvering
              simulator, based on simple PC  architectures.  In future phases the developed
              tools will be  used to develop procedures for optimal ship system design,  and
              in assisting shipboard decision making.
