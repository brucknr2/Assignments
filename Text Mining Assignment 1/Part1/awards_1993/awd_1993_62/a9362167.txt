              hydronium  SYMBOL 98 \f "Symbol" -alumina doped with divalent transition metal
              ions will be fabricated.  An electrochemical reactor utilizing the new
              membranes is to be constructed and tested for the oxidation of butane to
              isobutylene.    Isobutylene is an important intermediate for the industrial
              synthesis of a fuel additive.  New methods for the preparation and isolation of
              isobutylene are needed to help meet the automotive needs of the public while
              meeting federal regulatory requirements.  rconducting  unproven  visiometer
