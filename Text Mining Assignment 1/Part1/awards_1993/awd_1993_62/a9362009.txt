Abstract    :
              9362009  Murphy  Autonomous Undersea Vehicles (AUVs), subsea robots and other 
              instrumented and remotely operated systems for marine  applications require a
              power source which is as efficient as  possible to give long range or extended
              use times.  The obvious  choice is an electrochemical unit of fuel cell type.  
              Conventional fuel cells require hydrogen fuel, and they normally  use molecular
              oxygen as oxidant.  Aboard an AUV, for instance,  these materials would be
              expected to be carried as cryogenic  liquids, as in a space-craft.  This
              presents several practical  problems, among which are the difficulties of
              storage, safety and  handling, and buoyancy problems aboard the AUV as they are
               consumed.  This program examines alternative fuel and oxidant  combinations
              for use in an electrochemical fuel cell power  system.  The objective is to
              explore the possibility of fuel-  oxidant combinations with a specific energy
              which is an  improvement on cryogenic hydrogen and oxygen, but also to 
              determine whether such combinations have advantages in regard to  their
              practical specific volume including any additional volume  on board which may
              be required for displacement corrections  during propellant depletion.
