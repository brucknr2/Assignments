Abstract    :
              9362014  Bradley  The  goal  of this project is to develop a computer based 
              single  cell  image  analysis  system based on the  company's  novel  gel 
              microdrop  (GMD) technology.  This project combines the company's  proprietary 
              GMD  technology with recent  developments  in  other  fields  such  as 
              fluorescent dye chemistry, microscopy,  digital  processing,   and   optics.  
              The  core  GMD  technology   allows  identification, analysis and separation of
              single cells based  on  cell  function  such  as  growth,  drug 
              susceptibility,  protein  secretion,  enzyme  activity, or metabolite
              production,  or  cell  composition parameters such a surface markers, internal
              proteins,  or  nucleic acid sequences. Using a commercially available  image 
              analysis  system, this project intends to demonstrate feasibility  by  imaging 
              a  model hybridoma secretion assay which  will  both  identify  hybridomas 
              secreting higher amounts  of  antibody  and  allow  recovery for use in
              biotechnology applications.  In  Phase  II,  the company expects to optimize a
              single cell image analysis  system for use in drug discovery and bioprocessing
              research.  ***
