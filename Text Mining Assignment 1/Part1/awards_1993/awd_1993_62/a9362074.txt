Abstract    :
              Abstract - Alabama Cryogenic Engineering, Inc., 9362074      Partial oxidation
              reactions are very important routes to chemical synthesis.  A large fraction of
              all catalytic processes are oxidation reactions, and there is a need to reduce
              waste byproducts and to improve yield in the synthesis of a wide variety of
              specialty chemicals.  Oxidation reactions are very difficult and dangerous to
              manage.  Their exothermicity, speed, flammability and explosive potentials
              mandate extreme care in the design of reactors.  Consequently, current reactors
              for oxidation are designed very conservatively and far from yield optima. 
              Recent research has led to the development of new ceramic monoliths (solid
              metal plates perforated with small, uniform holes) for use in partial oxidation
              processes to catalyze very fast, high selectivity synthesis reactions such as
              the direct production of syngas from methane, olefins from higher alkanes, and
              formaldehyde from methanol.    This SBIR Phase I research project will test
              such metal monoliths as a new catalyst for carrying out these reactions.  Metal
              monoliths have high thermal conductivity, so that the heat of reaction can be
              removed and the reaction temperature regulated.  This will allow higher
              selectivities and greater yields than are possible with currently available
              ceramic monolith catalysts.  A new fabrication technique will be used that
              allows thin layers of noble metals to be incorporated into the holes of the
              monolith so that the reaction rate can be further enhanced.  Monoliths can be
              fabricated with hole diameters less than one micron and porosity's as high as
              65%.  The monoliths can be mounted in large arrays and thus be scaled up for
              commercial chemical production.
