Abstract    :
              9362031  Dunsmuir  Flavor in tomato fruit is associated with high levels of both
               sugars and acids.  It is known that the level of malic acid in the  fruit
              declines by 50% with fruit ripening and that this reduction  is thought to be
              mediated by a cytosolic NADP dependent malic  enzyme (NADP-ME).  The tomato
              NADP-ME genes which are expressed in  the pericarp during ripening by using a
              heterologous probe for  NADP-ME from maize will be isolated and characterized. 
              Once  isolated, the tomato genes will be used in genetic engineering 
              experiments so that the induction of NADP-ME which occurs during  ripening
              would be reduced or inhibited and higher malic acid levels  would persist
              within the ripe fruit.  In parallel higher levels of  the same enzyme in the
              fruit will be engineered in order to gain  insight into mechanisms which
              regulate acid levels in the fruit.  %%%  The anticipated outcome of this
              research would be the ability to  directly engineer the acid levels in fruit
              which could  significantly affect the flavor of tomatoes in the treatment of 
              processing tomatoes.  ***
