Abstract    :
                  9362070  SHLESER    Presently there are more than 2 million acres of shrimp
              farms  providing almost 40% of the world supply.  Shrimp farmed are 
              principally not-selected wild stocks or produced from unselected  farm reared
              broodstock.  Little work has been done to selectively  breed shrimp for
              performance in a farming environment.  If shrimp  can be bred for faster
              growth, the profitability for farming will  be improved.      This research is
              to obtain and identify stocks of Paneaus  vannamei, which can be selectively
              bred for improved farming  performance by: 1) screening existing specific
              pathogen free  (SPF) populations to select individuals to establish populations
               for the selective breeding program; and 2) establishing  populations and
              screening for variations in DNA patterns to  identify the stocks.  This
              research has the potential to develop  a technical basis for the domestication
              of penaeid shrimp and  provide the basis for more profitable shrimp farming in
              the US.
