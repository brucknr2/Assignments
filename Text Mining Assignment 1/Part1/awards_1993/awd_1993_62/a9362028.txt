Abstract    :
              9362028  Miccotto         There is a definite trend in early childhood education
               away from rote learning methods toward more child directed,  activity based
              learning. As children act upon and change the  external environment, they
              internally construct knowledge.   Constructivism stresses hands-on interactive
              learning  through problem solving activities that provoke thought and 
              reflection.              Many early childhood educators have endorsed and 
              integrated games as a primary means of Mathematics and Logic  education. Some
              games can provide an excellent opportunity  for children to compare, seriate,
              equate, count, and  establish a concept of number and logic. Unfortunately,
              they  games weren't designed for this specific purpose, and often  don't
              provide the level of interaction desired. Furthermore,  todays sophisticated
              children often tire of simple games.              We propose to empirically
              test the hypothesis that  interactive games can more efficiently promote
              constructive  abstraction of the concept of number, concept of inclusion, 
              concept of conservation, and other basic mathematical and  logical thought
              functions. Cognition of these concepts at an  early age would lay the
              foundation for development of higher  rational powers and independent thought.
              Furthermore, it  would directly improve mathematics performance, confidence, 
              and enthusiasm in later education.  ***
