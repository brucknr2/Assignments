Abstract    :
              9362015  Buck       Measurement of trace amounts of water vapor is critical to 
              industrial processes such as semiconductor fabrication, where  moisture in
              gases must often be below a few parts per billion  (PPB).  Water in trace
              amounts is also critical in high altitude  atmospheric chemistry, affecting
              global climate change and ozone  depletion.  Current instruments for measuring
              trace moisture are  severely limited.  Some cannot maintain calibration; others
              have  slow response times.  Most have limited sensitivity.       A cryogenic
              chilled-mirror hygrometer capable of extremely  high sensitivity (below one
              PPB) and very fast response time (a few  seconds) has been developed.  It is
              accurate and simple to operate.   However, to be fully useful in industrial
              processes, the  relationship between dew/frost point and vapor pressure 
              (enhancement factor) must be defined for industrial gases.  This  instrument
              provides direct means to determine enhancement factors  at very low moisture
              levels in a variety of gases.  This research  is to test and optimize the
              instrument for use as a trace moisture  sensor in industrial gases.  This work
              will make possible fast,  accurate measurements of trace water vapor in
              industrial gases and  the atmosphere.
