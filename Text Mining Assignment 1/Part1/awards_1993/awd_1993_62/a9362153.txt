Abstract    :
              9362153  Lavid  The objective of this project is to evaluate a process for the 
              treatment of hazardous waste streams containing chlorocarbons.   It is based on
              photo-initiated reactions induced by ultraviolet  light that selectively cleave
              the carbon-chlorine bond at  moderate temperatures.    This is a Phase I award
              based on a proposal submitted in response  to NSF 93-18, Small Business
              Innovation Research (SBIR) Program  Solicitation.  Results are expected to
              provide the optimal  conditions for application of this concept for use in
              design of a  prototype.    The major commercial applications are expected to be
              in the  hazardous waste treatment industry.  The proposed process is  expected
              to provide a cost-effective and environmentally benign  process for destruction
              of chlorinated organic compounds.
