Abstract    :
              9362063  Nicholson      A new laser crystal, praeseodymium yttrium lithium
              fluoride, is being proposed for development for applications in holographic
              interferometry.  Most pulsed laser holographic interferometry is presently
              performed with either frequency doubled neodymium yag or with ruby lasers. 
              There are a number of limitations imposed by either of these tow crystals, 
              some of which will be overcome by the new proposed crystal.  Holographic also
              anticipates the crystal will have significant applications in medicine and
              elsewhere.    Holographics proposes to prove certain aspects of the
              praseodymium crystal in Phase I, such as making a seed laser and gaining single
              longitudinal mode in an injection seeded gaussian mirrored oscillator. 
              Improvements in pumping efficiency will be attempted by using fluorescent
              converter and doped glass converters.  ***
