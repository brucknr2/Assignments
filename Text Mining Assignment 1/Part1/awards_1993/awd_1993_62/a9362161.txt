Abstract    :
              9362161  Coleman  The objective of this project is to evaluate a biological 
              nutrient removal process that provides an alternative to chemical  treatment
              methods, which produce a residue for disposal.  The  success and reliability of
              the biological process depends on the  ability to produce a fermentation
              product from the wastewater;  namely acetate and propionate.  Primary treatment
              sludge is  fermented to provide additional acetate, but where this has been 
              used, the acetate production has been below theoretical  expectations.  This
              may be due to the growth of other sulfate  reducing and methane forming
              organisms that consume the acetate.   The process to be evaluated in this
              project involves a primary  sludge fermentation system that uses intermittent
              oxygenation to  inhibit the organisms and thus greatly increase the
              fermentation  yield.  Experiments designed to test this concept will also 
              investigate the use of oxidation-reduction potential measurements  to control
              the process.  A higher acetate and propionate  production will greatly improve
              the reliability and performance  of biological phosphorus removal systems. 
              Experiments are  designed to test this innovative concept using primary sludge
              at  the City of Yakima WWTP.  Oxygenation frequency, duration and  control
              methods will be studied and the effect on acetate and  propionate yield will be
              followed.    This is a Phase I award based on a proposal submitted in response 
              to NSF 93-18, Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Program  Solicitation. 
              An improved primary sludge fermentation process  with a process control system
              using ORP measurements is expected.    This involves process technology,
              equipment design and a process  control system that can be marketed.  There is
              a significant need  for improved technology for biological phosphorus removal 
              economically competitive with chemical treatment systems.
