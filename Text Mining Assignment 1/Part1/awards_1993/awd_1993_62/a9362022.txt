Abstract    :
              9362022  Murphy  The objective of this project is to evaluate a concept for 
              reducing the pollutants emitted by internal combustion engines  during the
              period before the engine reaches its optimal operating  temperature.  In this
              approach, a method is proposed for rapidly  heating the catalytic converter by
              bleeding hydrogen into the  exhaust system upstream from the catalytic
              converter.  The  hydrogen is produced by electrolysis of water using energy
              from  the vehicle's battery and alternator.    This is a Phase I award based on
              a proposal submitted in response  to NSF 93-18, Small Business Innovation
              Research (SBIR) Program  Solicitation.  The results may potentially be applied
              to design  of internal combustion exhaust systems to reduce pollutants  emitted
              during start-up to levels produced when the engine and  exhaust system are at
              their normal operating temperature.
