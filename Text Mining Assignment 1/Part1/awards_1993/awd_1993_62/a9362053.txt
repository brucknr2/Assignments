Abstract    :
              9362053  Bliss  There is a large and growing number of persons with visual 
              diseases, such as age-related maculopathies.  The proposed  investigation is to
              develop efficient methods of evaluating an  individual's vision to determine
              the parameters for design of a  corrective spatial filter and to implement the
              filter and to  implement the filter in a practical system for reading and 
              writing.  The individual's contrast sensitivity function (CSF) is  to be used
              in determining the filter design parameters for image  enhancement to be used
              in the system.    The system that is envisaged would make use of low cost, high
               performance PCs (such as the 486).  One part of the system will  provide for
              image acquisition, image enhancement, and image  storage for easy access.  The
              other part of the system is to  access portions of the stored enhanced image,
              zooming, and  display.  Successful results from the investigation will provide 
              for significantly improved reading performance than provided by  magnification
              alone.  ***
