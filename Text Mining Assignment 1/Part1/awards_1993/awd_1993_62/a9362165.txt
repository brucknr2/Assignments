Abstract    :
              9362165  Rampalli       Mechanical System Simulation (MSS) is the technology 
              used to analyze systems undergoing large overall motion,  such as an automobile
              going over a pothole or a space  shuttle performing satellite retrieval.  MSS
              formulations  lead to a coupled set of Differential and Algebraic  Equations
              called Index-3 DAE.  Index reduction methods (IRM)  are employed to simplify
              and solve these equations.       Three factors determine the accuracy and
              stability of  solutions for mechanical systems: (a) the System States 
              selected, (b) the IRM used, and (c) the numerical integrator  used.  Ideally,
              these selections should be problem driven.  Yet, most commercial MSS software
              apply very limited  combinations of the above to all problems.  We will address
               this limitation be developing a library of IRM and  integrators, and allow for
              their independent selection.       In Phase-I, we will enhance an Augmented
              Lagrangian  Formulation, an IRM, to control constraint violation (ALF-  CC),
              implement it and demonstrate its effectiveness with two  integrators.  ALF-CC
              is very accurate and fast.  Unlike  other IRM, it promises to solve through
              singular  configurations, accommodate inequality constraints and  system
              topology changes.  ALF-CC will be compared to other  methods.       In
              Phase-II, we will expand this library and facilitate  creation of problem
              specific simulators.
