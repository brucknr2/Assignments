Abstract    :
              It has been known for quite some time that metaphors and                       
              analogies can redescribe an object, thereby creating new                       
              perspectives on it.  However, this phenomenon has not yet been                 
              properly addressed in cognitive science and AI research.                       
              Previous work has identified and characterized this process of                 
              redescription that underlies creative instances of metaphor and                
              analogy.  This work will implement a computational model of                    
              resdescription in the proportional analogy domain.  In this                    
              framework, an object is seen as an element of a finitely                       
              generated algebra, and a "description of the object is defined to              
              be any possible way in which that object can be generated from                 
              other objects by applying appropriate operators.  Typically, an                
              object can be generated in many ways and, consequently, has many               
              descriptions.  In designing the model, the problem then, is to                 
              find efficient algorithms and heuristics which select appropriate              
              descriptions of the objects so that the analogy relation is                    
              comprehensible.
