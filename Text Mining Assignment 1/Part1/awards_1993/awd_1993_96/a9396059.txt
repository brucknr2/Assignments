Abstract    :
              This project focuses on the physics of metal surfaces and thin                 
              films.  The collective and dynamical properties of electrons in                
              surfaces and thin films are studied by a range of surface physics              
              techniques, including photo electron spectroscopy, LEED, and                   
              inelastic electron scattering.  The research provides some of the              
              best current tests of theories of the electronic structures of                 
              metal.  The work also tests theories of electron spectroscopy                  
              lineshapes, and their relation to electronic structure.  The                   
              inelastic scattering experiments address dynamical properties, such            
              as plasmon excitations of electrons in metals.
