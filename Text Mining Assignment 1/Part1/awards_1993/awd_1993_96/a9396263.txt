Abstract    :
                   This Faculty Award for Women Scientists and Engineers is                  
              made to Dr. Sue Leurgans of the Department of Statistics, Ohio                 
              State University.  Dr Leurgans will continue her work on the                   
              development of statistical methodology.  In particular she will                
              work on multilinear models and multivariate responses.  Her work               
              is collaborative with scientists and engineers, and the work will              
              be highly computational.                                                       
                   The NSF Faculty Award for Women recognizes the high quality               
              of the awardee's record in teaching and scholarship as well as                 
              potential for continued significant contributions to scientific                
              research, the academic profession, and the education of future                 
              scientists.  Dr. Leurgans will continue her work on the                        
              development of statistical methodology to answer questions in                  
              science and engineering.  Particularly noteworthy are her effort               
              to increase the size and quality of the graduate program in her                
              department and her leadership as a role model to the other women               
              faculty in her department.
