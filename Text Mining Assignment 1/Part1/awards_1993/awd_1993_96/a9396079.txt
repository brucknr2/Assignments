Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Dimethyl sulfide is the major form of volatile reduced sulfur which            
              is emitted form the oceans to the atmosphere.  The flux of DMS has             
              an important impact on atmospheric chemistry and possibly global               
              climate.  The biogeochemical processes which control DMS                       
              concentrations in seawater are complex and poorly understood.  DMS             
              is produced from the degradation of B-dimethylsulfoniopropionate               
              (DMSP), a natural product of certain marine phytoplankton.                     
              However, recent investigations, suggest that only a small fraction.            
              of the total DMSP-sulfur in seawater is likely to escape to the                
              atmosphere.  This research will investigate several key aspects of             
              the seawater DMS cycle; 1) The mechanisms and rates of DMS                     
              degradation in seawater, concentrating mainly upon biological                  
              processes, and to a lesser extent photochemical processes; and 2)              
              The production of DMS from DMSP and testing whether two different              
              pathways are involved in DMSP degradation.
