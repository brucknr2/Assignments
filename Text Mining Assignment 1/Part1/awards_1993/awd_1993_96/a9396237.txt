Abstract    :
                   A new procedure will be investigated for extracting approximate           
              eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a nonsymmetric matrix from a given             
              subspace.  It is assumed that it is impractical to factor the matrix.          
              The procedure is related to the Rayleigh-Ritz procedure, but it gives          
              better estimates for interior eigenvalues.  It can improve convergence         
              rates for the Arnoldi method, for preconditioning methods such as              
              Davidson's method, and for other methods.  These methods will be               
              tested and compared.
