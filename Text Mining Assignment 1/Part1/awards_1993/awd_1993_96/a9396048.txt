Abstract    :
                   Curtis McMullen will continue his research in dynamical                   
              systems theory and its topological ramifications. Some of this                 
              work is related to Newton's algorithm for finding roots of                     
              equations and to the solvability of polynomials of low degree.                 
                   McMullen will investigate a geometric picture of the Mordell              
              conjecture over function fields and its relation to holomorphic                
              motions, horizontally holomorphic foliations and the Kobayashi                 
              metric. In the realm of complex dynamics he will study Julia sets              
              and limit sets of Kleinian groups. He will also continue his work              
              in topology and solvability of equations.
