Abstract    :
                      The glacial-interglacial history of tropical climate is                
              controversial. The record from marine sediments in the tropics                 
              suggests that there has been little change in atmospheric                      
              temperature in these regions.  On the other hand the climate                   
              record from tropical highlands documents that snowlines, glaciers              
              and treelines were all at lower elevation during the last                      
              glaciation.  These elevation changes translate into 5 to 6 degree              
              lower surface temperatures in the glacial tropics.  The                        
              discrepancies may be resolved with better paleoclimate proxies                 
              for lowland tropical locations.  Unfortunately it is difficult to              
              work on tropical samples because some traditional paleoclimate                 
              indices, like tree                                                             
              rings, are not related to tropical climate in a simple way.  This              
              proposal suggests an alternative methodology which may provide                 
              paleoclimate records on the basis of wood anatomy.  The basis for              
              the methodology is that wood porosity will vary as a function of               
              climate.                                                                       
                   The proposal requests support to test the theory in a study               
              area along the western coast of Costa Rica.  Although it is a                  
              high risk proposal, it is important because it may provide a new,              
              reliable method for reconstructing climate in tropical locales.
