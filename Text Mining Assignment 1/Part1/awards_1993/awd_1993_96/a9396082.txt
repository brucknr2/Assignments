Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Currently, the design of steel plate shear                                     
              walls is based on the elastic buckling as the                                  
              limiting condition.  This design criterion                                     
              results not only in an uneconomical design                                     
              but a system in which the building columns                                     
              may yield and/or buckle under a major                                          
              earthquake before the plate panels develop a                                   
              fraction of their strength.  The results from                                  
              this project will be used to provide                                           
              analytical tools and a guide to design                                         
              criteria for thin steel plate shear walls                                      
              under seismic loads, which take into                                           
              consideration the post-buckling strength of                                    
              the plate.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              One-quarter scale, one bay, three story thin                                   
              steel plate shear walls will be tested.  The                                   
              effects of cutouts in the plate representing                                   
              doors and window placement, the method the                                     
              plate is connected to the building frame, and                                  
              the effect of the axial compression in the                                     
              columns will be investigated in this                                           
              experimental program.  The test results are                                    
              expected to show stable hysterisis loops and                                   
              high energy absorbing capabilities of thin-                                    
              plate-shear-wall system as a viable                                            
              earthquake-resistant structural element.                                       
              Results of this project are expected to add                                    
              new insights on the performance of thin steel                                  
              plate shear walls in areas of high seismic                                     
              risk.
