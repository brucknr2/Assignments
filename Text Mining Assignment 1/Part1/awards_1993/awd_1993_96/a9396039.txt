Abstract    :
              A theoretical research program in nuclear astrophysics will be                 
              carried out.  Specific areas of study will include investigations              
              in nuclear physics, classical novae and related phenomena,                     
              nucleosynthesis, galactic chemical evolution, and the origin of                
              globular clusters.  Major problems to be addressed include:  (1)               
              the determination of thermonuclear reaction and weak interaction               
              rates relevant to diverse astrophysical studies;  (2)  the                     
              analysis of the general case of electron screening;  (3)  an                   
              analysis of the controlling physics of the super-Eddington phase               
              of evolution of classical novae in outburst;  (4) the possible                 
              consequences of the phase of commom envelope evolution that is                 
              known to be experienced by most classical novae in outburst;  (5)              
              the nature of outbursts triggered by high accretion rates onto                 
              hot white dwarfs;  (6) nucleosynthesis accompanying classical                  
              nova outbursts, including the production of the radioactivities                
              sodium 22 (22Na) and aluminum 26 (26Al);  (7) the consequences of              
              silicon burning in massive stars of low initial metallicities;                 
              (8) the operation of the r-process in the expansion and cooling                
              of highly neutronized matter;  (9) s-process nucleosynthesis in                
              red giant stars;  (10) nuclear cosmochronology;  (11) the                      
              evolution of the lithium abundance in the galaxy;  (12) the                    
              implications of abundances in metal deficient stars for early                  
              galactic chemical evolution; and (13) the nature of the origin                 
              and early evolution of the Milky Way globular clusters.
