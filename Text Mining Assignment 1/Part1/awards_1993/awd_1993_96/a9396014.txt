Abstract    :
              Antarctic diving petrels, unlike other surface-feeding seabirds in             
              the Antarctic, have lost their ability to produce stomach oils to              
              feed their young.  As a result, petrel chicks grow slower and                  
              fledge older than other seabird chicks reared on meals containing              
              a high (20%) percentage of stomach oils.  Any adaptive advantage               
              that stomach oils provide the chicks of these other seabirds                   
              remains unknown.  Using cross-fostering experiments, diving petrels            
              rearing chicks that are normally fed meal with stomach oils and                
              vice versa, Dr. Roby proposes to investigate how the presence or               
              absence of stomach oils in the meals fed to seabird chicks                     
              influence the growth rates.  Specific topics to be addressed are:              
              (1) gastrointestinal transit rates, (2) lipid assimilation                     
              efficiencies, (3) patterns of lipid storage and catabolism, (4)                
              growth and development, (5) adult foraging efficiency, and (6) net             
              production efficiency of the parent/offspring unit. The results                
              will be evaluated to address the ecological and energetic                      
              significance of stomach oils for reproduction in Antarctic                     
              seabirds, as well as the factors responsible for the absence of                
              stomach oils in diving petrels.
