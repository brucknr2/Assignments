Abstract    :
              In this project, the PI, along with a post doctoral student, will              
              study the mean momentum, heat, and eddy energy balances in the                 
              upper equatorial Pacific.  Data collected during the NORPAX                    
              Hawaii-Tahiti Shuttle Experiment, which includes both velocity and             
              hydrographic measurments, will be used.  Models of the equatorial              
              circulation will be compared, updated, and improved, using the                 
              results of the data analysis.
