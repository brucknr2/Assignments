Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  One of the most important and least understood processes                  
              operating at ocean ridges is the decomposition melting and melt                
              extraction from upwelling mantle peridotite. This project will                 
              determine the mechanisms of deformation in partially molten                    
              Iherzolites at conditions appropriate to melting under mid-ocean               
              ridge systems, and will determine the distribution melt                        
              generation during deformation. These experiments will be done in               
              a high-pressure deformation apparatus utilizing an improved drive              
              system and molten salt cell that allows differential stresses as               
              low as 3-5 MPa to be measured at any confining pressure. A suite               
              of synthetic Iherzolites of progressively less basaltic                        
              constituents will be synthesized in order to simulate the                      
              progressive melting and melt extraction that occurs in ridge                   
              environments. The effects of pressure on partially molten                      
              Iherzolite rheology and the effects of melt                                    
              chemistry and viscosity will be investigated.
