Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              North Carolina State University's Tropical Soils Research Program              
              and Colorado State University's Natural Resource Ecology                       
              Laboratory continue to investigate the determinants and                        
              consequences of soil organic matter (SOM) in the humid tropics.                
              Main activities consist of 1) determining the relative effects of              
              soil texture and clay mineralogy on total SOM content, 2)                      
              estimating the size of different SOM functional pools, 3) relating             
              their N and P supplying capacity to texture and mineralogy, 4)                 
              determining the relative importance of physical protection,                    
              chemical recalcitrance and nutrient availability on the SOM pools,             
              and 5) quantifying the effects of different land use practices on              
              SOM pools.  The CENTURY model will be modified for use in tropical             
              conditions.  The results will provide a deeper understanding of                
              organic matter dynamics in soils with variable charge which will               
              serve as a base for improved agricultural sustainability in the                
              humic tropics and more realistic estimates of CO2 emissions to the             
              atmosphere upon deforestation.                                                 
                                                                                             
              This is an excellent research team that pioneered the development              
              and calibration of the CENTURY model.  The model has been used                 
              extensively for studying soil development. The facilities                      
              available for this research are excellent.
