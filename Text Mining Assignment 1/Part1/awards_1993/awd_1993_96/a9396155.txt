Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The discovery of a new substance, found in the blood serum of                  
              many vertebrates, including humans, has been purified and                      
              preliminary biochemical evidence indicates that the factor is a                
              special type of albumin.  The factor activates a very general                  
              intracellular messenger system which is involved in many vital                 
              processes.  Studies show that this serum factor inhibits the                   
              multiplication of cancer cells and also causes the retraction of               
              nerve cell processes.  The substance is not present in normal                  
              cerebrospinal fluid, but it is present in cerebrospinal fluid of               
              patients following neurotrauma.  This factor may play a role in                
              injury and repair of the nervous system.  The main goal of this                
              project is to determine the amino acid sequence and structure of               
              the active site of the serum factor using enzymatic and chemical               
              fragmentation of the factor combined with methods of protein                   
              purification and structural analysis.  Blood serum and albumin                 
              are widely used in medicine and in tissue culture.  Gaining more               
              knowledge about this factor will have important implications for               
              both basic and medical sciences.
