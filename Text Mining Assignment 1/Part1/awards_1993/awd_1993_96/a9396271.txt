Abstract    :
              The objective of this study is to develop a kinematic hardening                
              model for soils that may be used in prediction of soil behavior                
              during large stress reversals and earthquakes. This model will be              
              developed on the basis of experimental evidence of the behavior                
              sand and clay during large three-dimensional stress changes                    
              involving unloading and reloading with and without rotation of                 
              principal stress axes. Part of the experimental results are                    
              available and part will be generated under this study. The                     
              results available from triaxial, cubical triaxial, and torsion                 
              tests on sand and clay indicate that development of a kinematic                
              hardening model is feasible.
