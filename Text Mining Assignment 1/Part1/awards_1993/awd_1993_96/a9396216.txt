Abstract    :
              The primary goal of this project is to create and expand research on           
              efficient algorithms, both sequential and parallel, on partial k-              
              trees, a family of graphs which is the subject of extensive study of           
              late.  The project covers design of new and efficient algorithms for           
              partial k-trees and sequential and parallel implementations of some of         
              these algorithms.  The approach is based on solid foundations of a             
              linear-time methodology (a systematic design tool) and not based on            
              the traditional, ad hoc method for designing algorithms.  The project          
              outlined here is significant in the following ways:                            
              1.  The project will address several outstanding issues in the design          
                  of combinatorial algorithms for partial k-trees.                           
              2.  This research will act as a catalyst for research in parallel              
                  algorithmic aspects of work being done on graph minors.                    
              3.  On the practical side, this research is expected to shed light on          
                  the performance of mutually competing approaches to solving                
                  problems on partial k-trees.*//
