Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Consistent with the mission of the JVNCnet which is to support                 
              the Academic and Research networking communities in the Northeast              
              and to facilitate the provision of networking services to these                
              institutions, Princeton is requesting partial support for the                  
              addition of 21 predominantly undergraduate institutions to the                 
              NSFNET family of networks through the JVNCnet midlevel network.                
                                                                                             
              These institutions have separatetly included information                       
              regarding their facility and their need to be a member of the                  
              NSFNET.  The list of schools includes: Bryant College,                         
              Connecticut College, University of Bridgeport, Drew University,

              Seton Hall, Rhode Island College, Connecticut State University,

              Adelphi College and Hofstra University.                                        
                                                                                             
              JVNCnet, now part of Princeton University, will act as a regional              
              or mid-level agent to identify the networking needs and assist                 
              the academic institutions in the Northeastern United States to                 
              meet those needs by providing connectivity, education and                      
              training.  In addition, the JVNCnet is working towards achieving               
              financial self-sufficiency by increasing its membership.***
