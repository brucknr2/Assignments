Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The proposal develops a theory of the relationship between                
              government-binding syntax and the Kamp/Heim theory of the                      
              semantics of noun phrases, focusing on a variety of pronominal                 
              constructions in various languages, including Egyptian Arabic,                 
              Spanish and certain Native American languages.
