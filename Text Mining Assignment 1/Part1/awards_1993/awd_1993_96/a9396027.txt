Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Calcium is recognized as a major intracellular modulator of                    
              metabolic functions in all cells and important in developmental and            
              repair processes of neuronal cells.  A major requirement for                   
              investigation of the role of calcium in these situations is the                
              ability to monitor changes in intracellular calcium over the                   
              several days to weeks required for the repair and growth process.              
              This project is designed to develop the methods to optically record            
              calcium fluorescence for periods of up to 2 weeks, simultaneously              
              monitoring cellular electrical properties.  These studies will be              
              followed up with ultrastructural studies to determine the                      
              intactness of the cell flowing long term fluorescent dye treatment             
              and electrophysiological studies.  This project has the potential              
              for opening new methods for direct monitoring of long term                     
              processes in cells and can be immediately used as probes for                   
              various processes are developed.
