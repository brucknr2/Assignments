Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Mathematics Process Writing Project builds on two                          
              previous NSF-supported teacher enhancement projects at                         
              Mount Holyoke College. Each year, 18 teachers involved                         
              in Mount Holyoke's SummerMath for Teachers program will                        
              be selected to write reflective narratives about                               
              mathematical teaching and learning processes in their own                      
              classrooms. A semester-long course and a series of                             
              workshops will support this activity. At the same time,                        
              project staff will prepare a book of case studies of                           
              teachers who have participated successfully in these                           
              inservice activities. These documents will be piloted in                       
              inservice teacher enhancement programs.                                        
                                                                                             
              Cost sharing is provided by local schools and Mount                            
              Holyoke College in the amount of 42% of the NSF award.
