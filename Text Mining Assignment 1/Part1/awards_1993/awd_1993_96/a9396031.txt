Abstract    :
              Microelectromechanical  systems                                                
              (MEMS) are devices that are machined                                           
              using bulk and/or surface                                                      
              micromachining (lithography) or the                                            
              LIGA process.  The resulting devices                                           
              are small enough that surface                                                  
              morphology can have a significant                                              
              impact on system performance.  This                                            
              study will seek to characterize such                                           
              surfaces by means of an analytical,                                            
              parsimonious model based on fratals.                                           
              Fractals will be evaluated for their                                           
              potential to represent typical                                                 
              micromachined surfaces reported in                                             
              the literature.  Then an attempt                                               
              will be  made to correlate the                                                 
              parameters of the fractal                                                      
              representation to key fabrication                                              
              steps and/or settings.  The                                                    
              objective of this research is to                                               
              develop a predictive model for MEMS                                            
              surface morphologies that is                                                   
              suitable for use in MEMS design and                                            
              in analysis of MEMS devices.
