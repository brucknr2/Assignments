Abstract    :
              This award supports work on modeling climate change on tectonic                
              time scales and focusing on the major glacial-nonglacial climate               
              transitions in Earth history.  In particular, this work focuses on             
              simulations for  (1) the Ordovician-Silurian (~440 Ma) glacial-                
              nonglacial couplet involving a possible glaciation at high CO2                 
              levels: (2) simulations of conditions favorable for late Paleozoic             
              glaciation and regional-scale comparison of results with                       
              economically important hydrocarbon and coal deposits on North                  
              America and Europe; and (3) implications of northward plate motion             
              for late Cenozoic onset of glaciation on Greenland.  By focusing on            
              these cases this research will address some of the more important              
              issues needed to develop a comprehensive theory of climate change              
              on tectonic time scales.
