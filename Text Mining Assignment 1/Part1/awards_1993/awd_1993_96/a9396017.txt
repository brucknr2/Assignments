Abstract    :
              Fundamental interest in the molecular mechanisms involved in the               
              evolution and function of developmental processes in mammals has               
              led to two lines of research: the first, the t haplotype variant               
              of mice and the second, gene conversion in mice. The t mutant has              
              about 15 centiMorgans of chromosome 17 which contains multiple                 
              conversions relative to wild type mice and which is transmitted to             
              nearly all offspring in a phenomenon called transmission ratio                 
              distortion. One of the most important of the genes in this complex             
              has been cloned in this laboratory and it is being characterized               
              by transgenic experiments. The second area of interest is being                
              approached by an attempt to determine the frequency of intra- and              
              interchromosomal meiotic gene conversion. Alternate promoters will             
              be use to investigate the frequency of this form of recombination              
              in various somatic cells in mice.                                              
                                                                                             
              These approaches represent new avenues for exploration of complex              
              and important genetic events in mammals.***
