Abstract    :
              This award is for support for a project to develop a data base                 
              from which regional metamorphic, deformation, and age relations                
              of high-grade basement metamorphic rocks in the Transantarctic                 
              Mountains of Antarctica can be better understood.  The rocks to                
              be examined come from the Nimrod Group in the central                          
              Transantarctic Mountains and the Lanterman Metamorphic Complex in              
              northern Victoria Land.  Improved documentation of their                       
              petrogenesis, age, and tectonic evolution are important for a                  
              thorough understanding of how the paelo-Antarctc craton evolved                
              and how the supercontinent Gondwana formed.  This study will                   
              involve detailed field geologic mapping and sampling, structural,              
              microstructural, kinematic and fabric analysis, metamorphic                    
              petrology and quantitative geothermobaro-metry, and Uranium-Lead               
              geochronometry.
