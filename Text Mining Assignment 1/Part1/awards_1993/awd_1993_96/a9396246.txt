Abstract    :
                   The Syracuse group will carry out a diverse program of                    
              studies in both classical and quantum gravity theory.  On the                  
              classical side, they will analyze properties of solutions to                   
              Einstein's equations by canonical methods, by the use of new                   
              dynamical variables, and by twistor methods.  On the quantum                   
              side, they will continue to study the quantization of gravitation              
              using their new tools (loop and connection representations).                   
              Other studies will investigate model systems (such as 2 + 1                    
              gravity), cosmological models, the role and meaning of time, and               
              measurement theory.                                                            
                   The goal of this work will be to extend classical                         
              gravitation theory to the quantum domain, to gain insight on any               
              exact quantum theory of gravity, and to overcome fundamental                   
              conceptual issues in this endeavor.
