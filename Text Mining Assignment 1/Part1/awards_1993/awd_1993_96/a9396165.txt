Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The primary goal of this project is to develop a general and                   
              fundamental theory of heat conduction in nanometer-scale solid                 
              structures.  Existing theories for heat conduction in bulk solids              
              are inadequate for that in nanostructures.  With current trends                
              towards manufacturing nanometer-scale devices, there is a                      
              compelling need for developing a theory for heat transport at these            
              scales.  This will be achieved by using analogies between heat                 
              conduction by electrons and phonons and radiative transfer by                  
              photons or electromagnetic waves.  The final goal is to unify the              
              theories of heat conduction and radiation in solids.                           
                                                                                             
              The results of this project could have a strong impact on the role             
              of heat transfer in nanotechnology.  The topic and the approach                
              described here are new and, as in any new research venture, the                
              initial stages will be exploratory and involve risks.  Therefore               
              an SGER grant is appropriate to support this project.
