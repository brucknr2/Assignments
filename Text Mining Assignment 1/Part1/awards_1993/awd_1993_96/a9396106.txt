Abstract    :
                   Research involves modeling, algorithic development and                    
              computer implementation of large, complex problems arising in                  
              transportation, distribution and logistics.  Techniques to be                  
              employed include interactive optimization, non-classical                       
              decomposition and relaxation strategies and incorporation of soft              
              constraints.
