Abstract    :
                   NOTE:  This is a collaborative project with Rensselaer                    
              Polytechnic Institute.  Hence, the same abstract is cited with both            
              projects.                                                                      
                   The study aims to determine the departmental conditions and               
              programs that do and do not work to improve the participation and              
              performance of women in doctoral education--thus addressing the                
              critical national problem of human resources in science.  Its                  
              purpose is to identify and assess organizational factors--such as              
              entry into area of specialty, inclusion in or exclusion from the               
              culture of the workplace, and the role of evaluative factors--that             
              affect the participation of women in doctoral education, their                 
              retention, reported satisfaction, publication productivity, and job            
              placement.                                                                     
                   The project is a cross disciplinary analysis of women's                   
              success in doctoral education in physics, chemistry, biology,                  
              electrical engineering, and computer science, focusing upon the                
              departmental environment.  The study employs in-depth interviews,              
              institutional analyses, and surveys of quantitative indicators at              
              three types of departmental sites:  (1) departments with                       
              significant programs in place to remedy problems women face in                 
              academic science--the vantage point of programs; (2) departments               
              that have made objectively notable improvements in the                         
              participation of women (in the absence of programs); and                       
              departments that have made no progress in raising the enrollment               
              levels and graduation rates of women students--also the vantage                
              point of outcomes.                                                             
                   The research is relevant to policy intervention at the                    
              doctoral stage of science education for women; (1) it encourages               
              creation of a critical mass of women faculty in academic science               
              and engineering; (2) it revises the image of high level careers in             
              science and engineering for women from an anomalous to a more                  
              "normal" role, thereby enhancing the incentive of achievement among            
              younger people.//
