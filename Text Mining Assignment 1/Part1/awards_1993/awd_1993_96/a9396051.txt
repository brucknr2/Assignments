Abstract    :
              Professor Gellene is supported by a grant from the Experimental                
              Physical Chemistry Program to use absorption and emission                      
              spectroscopy to study the neutral radicals which are in the                    
              neighborhood of the transition state on the potential energy                   
              surface of a polyatomic molecule.  The neutral radicals are                    
              produced by reneutralization of an ion beam and either remain                  
              in the transition state long enough to be observed in                          
              absorption spectroscopy or are in excited Rydberg states which                 
              vertically radiate to transition state regions by emission.                    
              Probing the transition state directly is important because the                 
              characteristics of the transition state region largely                         
              determine reactive events.  This approach is potentially                       
              applicable to systems for which the geometry of the positive                   
              ion closely resembles that of the transition state region.                     
              Specifically the technique will be applied to a study of 3- and                
              4-atom radicals containing H(or D), N, O and F.

              By preparing a species that has a structure that is in between                 
              the reactants and the products and doing spectroscopy on it in                 
              the relatively short time that it exists in this geometry,                     
              Professor Gellene hopes to characterize that state, called the                 
              transition state, which largely determines how a chemical                      
              reaction proceeds.
