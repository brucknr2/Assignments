Abstract    :
              This is a Presidential Young Investigator Award.                               
              The research objective is to develop a program to integrate                    
              large-scale and centrifuge data with numerical data in                         
              order to expand the usefulness of these test methods for                       
              geotechnical engineering.  Centrifuge tests will be                            
              conducted to model problems being addressed by on going                        
              large-scale tests and finte element analyses at Virginia                       
              Polytechnic Institute and State University.
