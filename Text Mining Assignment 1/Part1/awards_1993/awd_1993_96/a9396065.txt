Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The interaction between a host plant and a pathogen causing disease            
              to the plant is examined in this study of a tomato race and a                  
              xanthomonad.  The specific objective is characterization of the                
              essential role played by the avirulence gene, avrRxv, from the                 
              bacterium, that induces a resistant response in the plant.  An                 
              examination of the inductive conditions for expression of the gene             
              will utilize Western and reporter gene analyses; cell fractionation            
              studies will be carried out in order to learn the subcellular                  
              localization of this product, and specific elicitor activity will              
              be isolated and characterized.                                                 
                                                                                             
              The intricate interactions between a host plant and a pathogen for             
              it is to be examined, in this case between a tomato and a                      
              bacterium, Xanthomonas.  Focus of the study will be on the role of             
              a particular bacterial gene that brings about a resistant response             
              in the tomato host.
