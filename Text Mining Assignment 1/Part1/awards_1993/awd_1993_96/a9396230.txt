Abstract    :
              The PI proposes two areas of research continuation and                         
              initiation.  These areas are (1) mantle heterogeneity as the                   
              driving force of Mesozoic and Cenozoic plate motions, and (2)                  
              theory and experimentation on mantle plumes and hotspots.  The PI              
              intends to model recent earth evolution as a dynamical process in              
              understanding plate motions, as well as using the Galapagos                    
              Islands as a natural experiment to study mixing between MORB                   
              (ridge) and OIB (hotspot) geochemical sources.  In addition, a                 
              laboratory for geodynamics will be established at the University               
              of California, Berkeley.
