Abstract    :
              The work of Kevin Burgess is supported by the Synthetic Organic                
              Chemistry Program.  Burgess, an assistant professor of                         
              chemistry at Rice University, is studying the catalysis of                     
              hydroboration reactions by rhodium catalysts.  The                             
              non-catalyzed hydroboration reaction has had a major impact on                 
              oprganic synthesis; the catalyzed process will make the next                   
              major improvement in the utility of the chemistry.  Burgess                    
              will utilize chiral rhodium complexes to install chirality into                
              the hydroboration process.  Mechanistic studies, as well as                    
              general examination of the scope and limitation of the                         
              developing technology, will be a major emphasis of this new                    
              program.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              This proposal outlines plans to develop rhodium-catalyzed                      
              hydroboration reactions for routine use in preparative organic                 
              chemistry.  Asymmetric hydroborations mediated by various                      
              homochiral rhodium-phosphine complexes will be examined for                    
              substrates which include unfunctionalized and functionalized                   
              prochiral alkenes and a range of chiral allylic/homoallylic                    
              compounds.  Mechanistic studies performed in parallel with                     
              these general synthetic probes will be used to identify ways to                
              better understand the basic  chemistry involved as well as to                  
              find methods for changing and improving the technology.
