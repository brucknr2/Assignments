Abstract    :
              This is an individual award for the Postdoctoral Fellowship in                 
              Plant Biology.  The applicant received her Ph.D. from Northwestern             
              University and her Ph.D. research was in signal transduction in                
              animal cells.  She plans to carry out her postdoctoral fellowship              
              research in the laboratory of Dr. Donald Weeks at University of                
              Nebraska.  The proposed research entitled "Molecular analysis of               
              photoreceptor mediating phototaxis and entrainment of the circadian            
              oscillator in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii" will introduce the Fellow             
              to plant biology.
