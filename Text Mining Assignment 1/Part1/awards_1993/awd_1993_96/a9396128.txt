Abstract    :
              This research is concerned with the formation, growth, and eventual            
              oxidation of soot particles in diffusion flames.  The work will have           
              both experimental and theoretical parts.  The experiments will be              
              conducted on a steady, planar, counterflow, laminar diffusion flame.           
              The investigated parameters will be fuel concentration and temperature,        
              oxidizer concentration and temperature, and pressure level.  The               
              theoretical work will focus on modeling soot formation and oxidation in        
              the limit of low soot volume fraction.
