Abstract    :
                   This grant supports theoretical studies of specific                       
              mechanisms responsible for supernovae explosions.                              
              Hydrodynamics code will be used for detailed simulations.                      
              Some of the topics to be studied are the role of dense matter                  
              equations of state, predictions of neutrino fluxes and                         
              spectra, the influence of neutrino processes on cooling,                       
              supernovae collapse and neutron star formation.
