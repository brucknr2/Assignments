Abstract    :
              It has become a cliche to describe events of the past four years               
              as having created a historical turning point of virtually                      
              unparalleled proportions.  The liberation of Eastern European                  
              nations by its own citizens, the collapse of the Soviet Union, the             
              Persian Gulf War, and the emerging economic union of the European              
              Community have transformed the Cold War international system.  But             
              it is much less clear how the United States will react to the                  
              challenges, constraints, and opportunities of the new era; a                   
              retreat to neo-isolationism or a leadership role in creating and               
              sustaining institutions and regimes for coping with a wide array               
              of international issues are only two of the many possibilities.                
              Whatever choices the United States makes will have a significant               
              impact on the post-Cold War world order.  These choices will be                
              influenced by many factors, including the political beliefs of                 
              American opinion leaders.                                                      
                                                                                             
              This project seeks to gain reliable and systematic evidence about              
              the domestic and foreign policy beliefs of American opinion leaders            
              representing a wide range of institutions, including corporations,             
              labor unions, government, the media, the military, churches,                   
              universities, etc.  To do so the project will conduct a mail survey            
              of approximately 4,000 opinion leaders whose names have been drawn             
              from Who's Who In America, Who's Who of American Women, and similar            
              directories.                                                                   
                                                                                             
              The survey, to be conducted in the spring of 1992, will be the                 
              fifth in a series of studies of American opinion leaders undertaken            
              by the investigators.  Each of the previous surveys, undertaken in             
              1976, 1980, 1984 and 1988, yielded responses from over 2,000                   
              opinion leaders.  This unique body of data provides a strong                   
              baseline from which to measure the impact of the dramatic events               
              since 1988 on the political attitudes and beliefs of Americans who             
              are well positioned to play an influential role in the public                  
              dialogue about the appropriate international role for the United               
              States in the 1990s and beyond.                                                
                                                                                             
              The results of the 1992 survey will be made avaliable to the entire            
              social science community and will be an invaluable source for                  
              interested students of American foreign policy.
