Abstract    :
              This project introduces undergraduate civil engineering majors                 
              to the new and exciting field of environmental geotechnics.  A                 
              new undergraduate course is being introduced at Purdue                         
              University. using state-of-the-art laboratory equipment. The                   
              course is a combined instructional/laboratory course that                      
              provides the students with an understanding of all aspects of                  
              hazardous waste site assessment and instrumentation from the                   
              discovery that a hazardous waste site exists through to                        
              establishing safety and management strategies and culminating                  
              in an extensive evaluation of scientific equipment for                         
              assessing the type and extent of contamination in the air, soil                
              and water.  An  integral component of the course is the weekly                 
              laboratory sessions where the students will become familiar                    
              with the operation of a range of different modern scientific                   
              devices which are used to monitor and assess surface and                       
              subsurface conditions.  The development plan also incorporates                 
              preparation of video instructional materials and is linked to                  
              future research experiences for undergraduates.
