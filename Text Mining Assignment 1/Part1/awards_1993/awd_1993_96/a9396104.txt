Abstract    :
              This research deals with damping of dynamic systems by means of                
              thin fluid layers and jet flow impingement.  Vibration in                      
              mechanical systems is an increasingly inhibiting factor in the                 
              quest for higher efficiency and productivity, factors which often              
              translate as increased speed and light weight moving components.               
              In earlier work, the principal investigator has demonstrated that              
              damping obtained through the use of fluid layers is particularly               
              effective at low frequencies.  This project expands on that                    
              earlier work and attempts to enhance the damping effects achieved              
              therein.  Two topics are investigated here, comprising edge                    
              effects and free jet impingement effects.  For the first topic,                
              an effort will be made to make the edge effects (steady vortex                 
              and jetting) a dominant contributor to the damping.  For the                   
              second topic, the plan is to study the damping resulting from the              
              interaction of a vibrating surface with free jets impinging on                 
              it.  The project contains an experimental component to verify the              
              analytical aspects of the research.
