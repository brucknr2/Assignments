Abstract    :
              Laser chemical vapor deposition (LCVD) is a technique for maskless             
              patterning of fine surface structures at rapid deposition rates.               
              While gas dynamics control both deposition rate and deposit                    
              stoichiometry, the analysis methods developed for conventional                 
              chemical vapor deposition (CVD) are not applicable at the fast                 
              reaction rates of LCVD.  In the present study the primary process              
              parameters in LCVD and their interaction will be determined by                 
              experimental and theoretical techniques.  The results will be used             
              to develop predictive models for application in more complex or                
              less well known materials systems.
