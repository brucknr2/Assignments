Abstract    :
              This proposal focuses on the development of nonlinear signal                   
              processing systems and algorithms that can model or extract                    
              information about two types of nonlinear and time-varying phenomena            
              in speech production: modulations and turbulence. A model is                   
              proposed for short-time speech resonances that combines both                   
              amplitude and frequency modulation. Preliminary experimental                   
              findings are consistent with this model. Fractal models for                    
              describing the geometric fragmentation of the speech signals will              
              be used to quantify the degree of speech turbulence. A nonlinear               
              filtering algorithm is proposed to measure the short-time fractal              
              dimension of speech signals.
