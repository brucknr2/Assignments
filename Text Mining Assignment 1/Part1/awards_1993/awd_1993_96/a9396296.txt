Abstract    :
              The objective is to develop theoretical and practical                          
              tools and techniques for transforming geometric                                
              control theory into practical nonlinear control design                         
              methodology.  Currently, most nonlinear control                                
              techniques require some type of regularity conditions                          
              such as complete integrability of a set of system                              
              vector fields.  Unfortunately, many important systems                          
              fail to satisfy these conditions.  The proposed                                
              approach is to find an approximate model for the                               
              given system that satisfies the desired conditions.                            
              Other areas of emphasis include research in                                    
              nonlinear system modeling, robustness and                                      
              performance, and the construction of illustrative                              
              examples.
