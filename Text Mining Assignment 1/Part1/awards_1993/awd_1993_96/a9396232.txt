Abstract    :
                   The research consists to two components: First, is the                    
              observational constraints necessary for the project.  A large                  
              amount of information on the history of plate motions and on the               
              distribution of possible driving forces will be compiled and                   
              represented in ways that are useful for dynamical calculations.                
              Second, modelling techniques will be developed for application to              
              present-day plate motions to understand the forces that have                   
              controlled past plate motions, inferring also the history of                   
              associated mantle flow and viscous stresses.  These models will be             
              useful not only in understanding plate tectonics and mantle                    
              convection, but also the long-term history of mantle heterogeneity,            
              along with associated variations in the geoid, dynamic topography,             
              Earth rotation,a nd sea-level.  The overall goal of this research              
              is to create a computer laboratory for studying the dynamics of                
              past plate motions and their influence on the geophysical (and                 
              geochemical) evolution of the plate.  This project is jointly                  
              funded by NSF and NASA.
