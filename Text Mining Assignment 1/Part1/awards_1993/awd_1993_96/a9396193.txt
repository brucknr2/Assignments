Abstract    :
                   The broad theme of this research is the creation of                       
              intelligent, dexterous, self-sustaining machine tools for the                  
              small-batch manufacturing industry.  With previous National                    
              Science Foundation support, the Principal Investigator has                     
              developed an expert system that plans the setup processes for                  
              rectangular-type parts in a parallel-sided vise on a three-axis                
              Computer Numerical Control (CNC) milling machine.  At the same                 
              time, clamping and fixturing methods have been systematically                  
              studied and an automated fixturing device has been made and used.              
                   The specific work consists of: (1) broadening the expert                  
              system planning software to encompass more complex part shapes                 
              that will require more setup steps, the use of toe-clamps and the              
              possible use of more complex fixtures, (2) combining this expert               
              system approach with a more solid mechanics approach to stable                 
              fixturing that will come more into play as our parts increase in               
              complexity away from the simple rectangular parts held in a                    
              parallel-sided vise, and (3) the construction of prototype                     
              fixtures that can handle more complex part types.                              
                   In this research, the software that integrates the machine                
              tool planning and clamping functions is referred to as the                     
              Unified Machining Planner; the programmable hardware that will be              
              developed is referred to as the Flexible Clamping System.
