Abstract    :
                   The objective of this research is to analyze, design,                     
              construct and test a precision, magnetically-suspended, six                    
              degrees-of-freedom motion control stage with 1 Angstrom resolution             
              (0.004 micrometer) in a 100 micrometer cube of accessible travel.              
              The suspended platen will be floated in oil to support its weight              
              and provide mechanical damping and high-frequency coupling.                    
              Advances will be made in sensors, actuators, precision control                 
              algorithms and mechanical design. The research techniques can be               
              scaled, in principle, to larger travels and lessor degrees of                  
              freedom, as necessary from the application perspective.                        
                   This development will enable the enhancement of the                       
              performance of many nano-precision devices, in applications such               
              as scanned probe microscopy, X-ray and optical photolithography,               
              diamond tool machining and probing and analysis of integrated                  
              circuit devices.  These processes are of considerable utility in               
              the manufacturing of a variety of devices and products that are                
              vital to the economy of the nation.
