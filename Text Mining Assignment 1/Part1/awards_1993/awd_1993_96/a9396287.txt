Abstract    :
              An SGER award will support a study of the feasibility of using                 
              changes in surface potential to measure wear of materials.                     
              Tentative results from a laboratory in Belarus indicate that the               
              technique has substantial potential as an in situ, non-contact,                
              low-cost method of monitoring wear processes.  The work will                   
              initially concentrate on stainless steel and single crystal                    
              silicon subject to wear in a vacuum.  The surface potential                    
              changes will be measured with a vibrating capacitor Kelvin probe               
              and correlated with friction and wear behavior.  Once the                      
              baseline data have been determined in a vacuum the equipment will              
              be tested on surfaces sliding in polar molecular liquids, such                 
              as water, in order to test the feasibility of using the technique              
              in lubricated systems.  The Belarus scientist will participate in              
              the initial equipment development and data analysis.
