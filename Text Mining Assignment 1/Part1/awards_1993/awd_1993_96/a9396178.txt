Abstract    :
                   Climate influences vegetation through its effects on fire                 
              regimes.  In order to understand how future climate changes will               
              alter global vegetation patterns, we must understand the role of               
              fire during times of rapid climate and vegetation change.  In                  
              this study, Dr. Clark will be determining the frequency of fires               
              at these times of rapid climate and vegetation change.  He will                
              be coring lake sediments that contain fossil charcoal produced by              
              these fires.  Annual laminations in the sediments allow the                    
              investigator to determine in the age of this charcoal and to                   
              reconstruct the frequency of fires at these times.  These                      
              reconstructed fire regimes will be compared with vegetation and                
              climate changes known from fossil pollen and other data.  These                
              patterns will then be mapped across eastern North America to                   
              establish the spatial and temporal patterns of fire occurrence                 
              that prevailed when the climate was changing rapidly.  These                   
              results will help us to interpret the potential role of fire as                
              climate changes in the near future.
