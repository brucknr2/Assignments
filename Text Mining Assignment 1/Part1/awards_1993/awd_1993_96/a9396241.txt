Abstract    :
                   Tolerance synthesis is a major task of product and process                
              design and is in a period of extensive study due both to increased             
              demands for quality products and to increasing automation of                   
              machining and assembly.  Optimum tolerance design and synthesis                
              ensures good quality product at low cost.  The primary goal of this            
              research project is to develop an analytical methodology for                   
              concurrent optimization of design and manufacturing tolerance                  
              syntheses to enhance product manufacturability, quality and cost               
              effectiveness.  Based on a more complete understanding of the                  
              relationships between dimensional tolerance and machining cost,                
              process capability and tolerance, mathematical models for these                
              relationships are to be formulated.  As its objective function the             
              minimum manufacturing cost, and optimization model for concurrent              
              tolerance syntheses will then be developed based on the above                  
              relationships.  The project will extend and augment previous                   
              research on the development of solution procedures for the                     
              tolerance optimization model.  In particular, simulated annealing              
              algorithm and discrete optimization techniques will be investigated            
              and implement.                                                                 
                    This research project will tie together disparate efforts                
              that tend to treat design tolerance synthesis and manufacturing                
              tolerance allocation as separate problems.  The goal is to achieve             
              more economical manufacturing                                                  
              through tolerance optimization.
