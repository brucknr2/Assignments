Abstract    :
              Bacteria able to grow at temperatures at or above 100                          
              degrees C, i.e., hyperthermophilic archaebacteria, have only                   
              recently been isolated from a variety of geothermal                            
              locations.  The work proposed here addresses physiological,                    
              genetic, biochemical and engineering issues for proteolytic                    
              enzymes produced by Pyrococcus furiosus, which has an                          
              optimal growth at 100 degrees C.  Initial studies will focus                   
              on the use of hyperthermophilic proteases as alternatives                      
              to those currently used in biochemical processing.  In                         
              addition, issues related to the extreme thermostability of                     
              thermal stable proteases will be investigated to attempt to                    
              determine the structural basis for function at elevated                        
              temperatures.
