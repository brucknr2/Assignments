Abstract    :
                   Research efforts funded by this Presidential                              
              Young Investigator grant initially will be concentrated in two                 
              areas: carrying out experiments at CERN; and preparing for                     
              experiments at RHIC (U.S. Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider).  The               
              CERN work will be performed on the NA44 experiment, which studies              
              high energy heavy.ion collisions with a focussing spectrometer.                
              In the first two years, experiments will be carried out                        
              with proton and sulfur beams; after that, heavier beams such as                
              lead will become available (by 1992.1993).  Efforts for RHIC                   
              will involve silicon drift chamber development work at Pitt                    
              and Brookhaven National Laboratory, ultimately directed                        
              toward using this device in a small acceptance spectrometer                    
              suitable for pion interferometry measurements.
