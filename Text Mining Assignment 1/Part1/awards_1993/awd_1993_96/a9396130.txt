Abstract    :
                   This Presidential Young Investigator proposes to use his PYI              
              award to investigate new methods to analyze the performance of                 
              communication protocols by looking for methods that aggregate or               
              decompose states of a protocol (along boundaries that arise form               
              its structure and analyze the dynamics between the resulting                   
              subsets of states.  In addition, he is studying dynamic routing                
              of information in deterministic network models, scheduling                     
              conversation between communication stations, and the topology of               
              design of networks.  He is also studying local search                          
              optimization algorithms such as simulated annealing.
