Abstract    :
              The research goal is to build a specification and analysis methodology         
              for safety-critical software.  Although past research included                 
              techniques to enhance safety throughout the software development               
              process, the recognition that most accidents can be traced back to             
              inadequate requirements and design foresight has led to concentration          
              on the early parts the software life cycle.  This work will build an           
              integrated set of software requirements and design methods and                 
              techniques to increase confidence in the safety of software                    
              requirements and design methods and techniques to increase confidence          
              in the safety of software that is controlling critical systems such as         
              aircraft and other transportation systems, medical devices, and                
              nuclear power plants.  It will lead to better understanding what is            
              required to provide a "safety analyst's workbench" that would allow            
              software and systems engineers to build models and perform a variety           
              of analyses on the software requirements and design in order to                
              predict and verify a wide range of software properties during                  
              development.                                                                   
              The above goals will be pursued within the context of a real, safety-          
              critical avionics (Collision Avoidance of TCAS) system in order to             
              provide a testbed to validate practicality, effectiveness, and                 
              feasibility as the hypotheses and ideas are generated and to keep the          
              research on a track toward realistic and usable results.  The testbed          
              approach will allow evaluation of alternatives in a realistic setting,         
              altering directions when necessary, and validating and demonstrating           
              results on a real system.
