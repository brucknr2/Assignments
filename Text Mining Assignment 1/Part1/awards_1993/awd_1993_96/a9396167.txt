Abstract    :
                   This is the first year of a three-year continuing award.                  
              The research focuses on analytical and experimental study of                   
              dynamical dexterity in robotic manipulation, addressing                        
              fundamental issues in planning, coordination, and effective use                
              of limited sensory capabilities.  The research builds on the PI's              
              previous research on robot juggling of objects in two dimensions;              
              this will now be extended to three dimensions.  The paradigm of                
              juggling demands a holistic, task-oriented approach to planning                
              and control, involving tracking of one or several objects in                   
              space, trajectory matching, making compliant intermittent contact              
              or impact, and coupling of sensing and manipulation in real time.              
              The results should provide a rich addition to the knowledge base               
              for design and execution of a wide variety of robotic tasks                    
              including dynamical manipulation of objects on the fly for rapid               
              assembly-line operations, and some forms of dynamic legged                     
              locomotion.
