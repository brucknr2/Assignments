Abstract    :
              In this research project, an innovative methodology is developed               
              for analysis, design and simulation of high-order complex                      
              nonlinear dynamic systems having an underlying multiple time-                  
              scale structure. A general approach is formulated for time-scale               
              identification, efficient numerical simulation, and reduced-                   
              order model development for high-order nonlinear systems                       
              encountered in the context of designing machines, processes,                   
              structures, vehicles and robotic manipulators. The methodology is              
              based upon the use of Computational Singular Perturbation (CSP)                
              technique, which is an iterative decoupling procedure originally               
              developed for singularly perturbed linear systems. The                         
              application of this methodology has been successfully                          
              demonstrated for stiff problems in chemical kinetics. In this                  
              research, both initial and boundary value problems are addressed.              
              Formulating system design problems in the framework of optimal                 
              control leads to Hamiltonian boundary-value problems which often               
              have multiple time-scale structures. The modified and extended                 
              CSP method is used as a user friendly software-oriented general                
              tool for such problems, and provides a significantly new                       
              capability for complex nonlinear system analysis and design.***  //
