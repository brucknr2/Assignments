Abstract    :
              Important structural information about the structure of the                    
              hot "chromospheres" of cool stars can be inferred best by                      
              studying the shapes of strong "resonance" spectral lines, such as              
              the Lyman-alpha line from neutral hydrogen and the H and K lines               
              of ionized calcium.  In this one-year award the Co-Investigator,               
              Dr. Kenneth Gayley, will develop simple probabilistic formalisms               
              that may extend our insight into the "partial redistribution"                  
              process by which the wings of these resonance lines are formed.                
              The goal of this study is to see whether it is feasible to adopt               
              shortcuts that reflect realistic physical assumptions in lieu of               
              complex numerical simulations, which few astrophysicists are in a              
              position to formulate and implement.  If successful, this                      
              feasibility study is expected to have application to a variety of              
              problems, including the atmosphere of the Sun, active galactic                 
              nuclei, and quasars.
