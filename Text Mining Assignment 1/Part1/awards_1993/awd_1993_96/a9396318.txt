Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Description:  This project provides for collaboration between Dr.              
              J.N. Reddy of the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State                     
              University (VPI), and two scientists from the Indian Institute of              
              Science (I.I.Sc.) in Bangalore, Drs. A.V. Krishna Murty, and                   
              Vijay Kumar.  These scientists will continue theoretical,                      
              analytical studies on the behavior of laminated composite panels               
              under compressive loads.  Specifically, they are seeking to                    
              develop analytical tools to describe the process of delamination               
              in such panels.  These studies will, furthermore, be useful in                 
              determining residual strength of these plates.  The collaborative              
              work will benefit from experimental work being done independently              
              by the Indian team at the I.I.Sc.                                              
                                                                                             
              Scope:  This project provides support to extend collaborative                  
              research currently being carried out by the same scientists under              
              an earlier NSF grant.  The work has already provided better                    
              understanding of the problem, and resulted in several joint                    
              publications.  The project fits well with the objectives of the                
              U.S.-India Cooperative Science Program.
