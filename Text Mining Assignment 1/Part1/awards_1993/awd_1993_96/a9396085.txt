Abstract    :
                   This study seeks to understand the consequences of high-                  
              density predator aggregations to prey behavior and predator-                   
              predator interactions.  In central Oklahoma, two species of                    
              predaceous antlion larvae (Neuroptera: Myrmeleontidae) coexist                 
              at very high densities in a narrow zone at the base of sandstone               
              cliffs.  From the prey's perspective, what are the behavioral                  
              responses to this spatially persistent predation risk?  The                    
              foraging strategy of ants will be studied in response to                       
              experimental field manipulations of predation risk and foraging                
              reward.  From the predator's perspective, what are the                         
              interactions between species that occur within the zone?  The                  
              nature of these interactions will be revealed through a series of              
              field experiments that manipulate predator density and food                    
              supply.  The results of this study will shed light on the details              
              of predator-prey interactions, and may provide insight into                    
              effective strategies for biological control of arthropod pests.
