Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              The major pool of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the ocean is               
              an order of magnitude larger than the particulate organic carbon               
              (POC) pool, and twice as large as the atmospheric pool of CO2,                 
              yet as much as 90% of DOC remains uncharacterized as to specific               
              chemical identity.  One component of this uncharacterized pool is              
              known as "humic substance" or "gelbstoff", two non-specific terms              
              for a complex mixture of compounds having a yellow color and a                 
              blue fluorescence.  The way in which these compounds have been                 
              defined and analyzed in the past has resulted in much confusion                
              and a lack of insight regarding their nature, distribution, and                
              cycling in the ocean.  Recent developments in fluorescent                      
              spectroscopy and high performance liquid chromatography show                   
              promising results when applied to the study of gelbstoff in                    
              seawater.  Three-dimensional excitation-emission matrix (EEM)                  
              analysis of unconcentrated samples has shown for the first time                
              the existence of four different fluorophores in seawater, each of              
              which exhibits characteristic properties and distributions.  One               
              of these fluorophores may be indicative of a protein-like,                     
              bioreactive substance.  Ion-pairing HPLC can resolve gelbstoff                 
              into up to twenty individual components.  Application of these                 
              new technologies in tandem to the analysis of dissolved organic                
              matter in seawater can be used to trace different components of                
              the DOC, thereby leading to an improved understanding of the                   
              oceanic carbon cycle.
