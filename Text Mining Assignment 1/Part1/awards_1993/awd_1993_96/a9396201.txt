Abstract    :
              The research is on linking tools for formal verification of IC                 
              designs and those to those used for simulating and fabricating the             
              designs.  The PI is working with a verification environment (Hol),             
              a set of design tools based on a hardware description language                 
              (Bolt), and a simulation language (Nova).  Research being                      
              undertaken includes: (1) find a theoretical basis for the                      
              translation between the behavioral (verification tool) and                     
              structural (design tool) models;  (2) develop a formal semantics               
              for Bolt and embed the formal semantics into the Hol system; (3)               
              develop common abstraction mechanisms for Bolt and Nova;                       
              investigate parameterized, generic models for circuits to serve as             
              a guide to translation between the verification model and the                  
              design tools; develop software for carrying out the combined design            
              and verification process.
