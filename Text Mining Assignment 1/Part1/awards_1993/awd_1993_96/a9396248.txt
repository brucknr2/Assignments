Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is an investigation of the feasibility of depositing                      
              hard-to-plate metals from a supercritical fluid and of the                     
              fundamental physicochemical phenomena associated with such a                   
              process including electrode kinetics, solution conductivity,                   
              and dielectric behavior.  Initial studies will be on the                       
              recently demonstrated process for electroplating aluminum on                   
              copper from a supercritical mixture of toluene, ethane,                        
              aluminum bromide, and potassium bromide.  Electrodeposition of                 
                                                                                             
              titanium will also be examined.                                                
                                                                                             
              If successful, this approach offers a broad range of possible                  
                                                                                             
              metal platings with metals possessing desirable properties                     
              with respect to electrical conductivity, chemical catalysis,                   
              or corrosion resistance.  These new materials could find                       
              application in a variety of electronic and structural                          
              materials applications.  Extension of the approach to alloys                   
              and semiconductors may also be possible.
