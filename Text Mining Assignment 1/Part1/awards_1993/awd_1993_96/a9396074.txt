Abstract    :
              This project will investigate a                                                
              variety of approaches, to improve                                              
              the ability of artificial neural                                               
              networks (ANN) to learn                                                        
              classifications or general                                                     
              mathematical functions.  It will                                               
              investigate alternative functional                                             
              forms for ANNs, building on the                                                
              PI's prior work with radial basic                                              
              functions and B-splines.  It will                                              
              investigate methods for adapting

              theory.  It will investigate                                                   
              alternative error functions, beyond                                            
              the usual square error function,                                               
              designed to yield better
