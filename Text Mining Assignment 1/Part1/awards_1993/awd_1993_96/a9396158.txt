Abstract    :
              In this proposal, we plan to continue our theoretical                          
              investigations on the wave and particle dynamical properties                   
              associated with ultra-low-frequency magnetic pulsations in the                 
              Earth's magnetosphere.  Specifically, we propose to study the                  
              following aspects of the drift-Alfven-ballooning modes: (i)                    
              numerical investigations of the stability properties in self-                  
              consistent, anisotropic, high-B magnetospheric plasmas: (ii)                   
              gyrokinetic analyses of associated particle flux modulations;                  
              (iii) nonlinear wave-particle interactions between energetic                   
              ring-current ions and instabilities; and (iv) nonlinear mode-                  
              coupling effects on the instabilities.  (i) and (ii) thus deal                 
              with the linear aspect of the wave excitation mechanism and the                
              purpose here is, by comparing with satellite observations, to                  
              identify the mechanisms both qualitatively and quantitatively.                 
              (iii) and (iv) meanwhile examine the nonlinear consequences of                 
              the instabilities in terms of both the saturated wave amplitudes,              
              spectra and induced particle diffusion.  Theoretical results will              
              be compared with available observations.  This proposal                        
              constitutes a major portion of a Ph.D dissertation project and,                
              hence, a three-year grant is requested.
