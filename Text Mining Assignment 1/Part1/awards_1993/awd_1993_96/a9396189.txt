Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The long term goal of this proposal is to understand how                       
              positional information is established in the Drosophila egg                    
              during oogenesis. Dr. Cohen is focussing on the expression and                 
              function of the K10 and C factor genes. His interest in K10 stems              
              from its known requirement in the establishment of dorso-ventral               
              polarity in the egg; females deficient for K10 gene activity                   
              produce abnormally shaped eggs that, if fertilized, die as                     
              embryos. Dr. Cohen's recent data indicate that K10 is transcribed              
              exclusively in nurse cells, but that its transcripts are                       
              selectively and rapidly transported into the oocyte where they                 
              are translated. Genetic and molecular approaches will be used to               
              identify the proteins involved in the transport of K10 RNA from                
              nurse cells to oocytes. Dr. Cohen's interest in C factor stems                 
              from its potential role as both an activator of transcription in               
              nurse cells and a repressor of transcription in oocytes. The                   
              exclusive synthesis of RNAs in nurse cells appears to be a                     
              prerequisite for the subsequent localization of some RNAs to                   
              specific regions of the oocyte. To elucidate C factor function he              
              will; 1) determine the distribution of C factor protein in nurse               
              cells and oocytes, and 2) identify/generate C factor mutants.
