Abstract    :
              This proposal will support the improvements of and further                     
              developments for computer programs that apply maximum likelihood               
              (statistical) techniques in the area of quantitative genetics.                 
              The specific goals will be the simplification of the program's                 
              use, improved convergence behavior of the program, and expansion               
              of general capability for statistical testing.  By greatly                     
              facilitating quantitative genetic studies, this work is likely to              
              have a broad impact in the biological and behavioral sciences.
