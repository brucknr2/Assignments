Abstract    :
              Geochemical and physiological processes mediated by magnetotactic              
              bacteria are not well understood despite the fact that these                   
              unusual procaryotes are ubiquitous in and easily collected from                
              aquatic habitats.  Preliminary results with several new isolates of            
              magnetotactic bacteria strongly suggest that cells of these strains            
              are involved in the oxidation of reduced sulfur and perhaps iron               
              compounds.  Moreover, these results show that these strains can                
              grow with reduced sulfur compounds as sole energy (electron)                   
              sources using carbon dioxide as the sole carbon source.  Thus, it              
              is likely that these new strains can grow chemolithoautotrophically            
              and perhaps mixotrophically as well.  Microbiological, chemical,               
              and biochemical strategies will determine the role of these new                
              strains of magnetotactic bacteria in sulfur and iron cycling and               
              their chemolithoautotrophic potential.  The results obtained from              
              this study will be invaluable in understanding the overall                     
              physiology of magnetotactic bacteria, in ascertaining the                      
              geochemical roles magnetotactic bacteria play in nature, in the                
              isolation of new strains, and ultimately in how they synthesize                
              their magnetic mineral component.
