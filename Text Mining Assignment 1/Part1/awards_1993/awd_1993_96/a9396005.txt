Abstract    :
                   Recent studies have revealed many interesting structural                  
              properties of kanban controlled serial systems.  These properties              
              suggest procedures for efficient card allocation, estimation of                
              throughput and other inventory related measures.  The efficacy of              
              kanban control policies for systems with stage failures and limited            
              repairs has not, however, yet been studied.                                    
                   Stage failures, limited repair and schedule of repair may                 
              affect the system throughput via unavailability of the stages along            
              with adverse bowl and variance effects.  Investigation of such                 
              systems is already under way resulting in a robust probability                 
              model that yields an expression of throughput.  This research                  
              extends current frontiers by focusing on the following topics:  (a)            
              effect of repair schedule on system performance, (b) throughput                
              estimation of decomposition, and (c) kanban allocation limit.  The             
              outcomes of this research will provide tools for more efficient                
              design and control of serial production systems.
