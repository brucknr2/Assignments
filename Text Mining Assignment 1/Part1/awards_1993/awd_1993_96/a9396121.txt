Abstract    :
                   This award supports a workshop to promote partnerships between            
              the Department of Education and the NSFNET mid-level networks.  The            
              meeting was conducted on July 29, 1992,  in Washington, D.C.  DoEd             
              representatives at the meeting were from the ten Regional Education            
              Laboratories and from the DoEd Office of Educational Research and

              from FARNET represented the NSFNET mid-level networks.  The meeting            
              focussed on cooperation between the Labs and the mid-levels,                   
              particularly regarding meeting K-12 needs.
