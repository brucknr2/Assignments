Abstract    :
              In an online problem the input is revealed to the algorithm only one           
              piece at a time, whereas an omniscient adversary knows the entire              
              input in advance.  How well can this online algorithm perform relative         
              to the prescient adversary?  Just how valuable is foresight?  This is          
              the central question in the study of online algorithms.                        
              This project will study online problems with the goals of constructing         
              better online algorithms and of proving lower bounds on their                  
              performance.  Specifically, one focus will be the study of server              
              problems in which mobile servers move among the points of a metric             
              space, serving requests, and in which the complexity measure is the            
              total distance moved by the servers.  Also, motion planning, layered           
              graph traversal, coloring, scheduling, and list updates will be                
              considered from the online perspective.  Algorithmic questions related         
              to genetics will also be studied.
