Abstract    :
              The research seeks to combine concepts in Kinematics and Computer              
              Aided Geometric Design (GAGD) to study motion interpolation and                
              approximation problems from a computational geometric                          
              perspective. The goal is to develop computational geometric                    
              structure and algorithms that are suitable for computer aided                  
              geometric synthesis of rigid body motions both with and without                
              kinematic constraints. The basic approach involves converting the              
              motion synthesis problem into a geometric problem of designing                 
              curves, surfaces, or solids. This is made possible using an                    
              orientable kinematic mapping which transforms motions (with one                
              or more degrees of freedom) in the Euclidean space into curves,                
              surfaces, or solids in a special projective space called the                   
              image space. The mapping facilitates integration of various                    
              methods in the fields of GAGD and computer algorithms to solve                 
              the motion synthesis problem. The research will develop image-                 
              space algorithms for designing a class of smooth piecewise                     
              parametric motions that interpolates through a sequence of                     
              displacements and develop geometric methods for approximating                  
              algebraic motions with the parametric motions. The results, in                 
              addition to their theoretical interest in computational                        
              geometry of motions, have applications in the design of spatial                
              mechanisms and manipulators, computer animation of motions, and                
              mechanical system simulation.*** //
