Abstract    :
                   This research is concerned with the representation theory of              
              quantum groups and its relation with the modular representation                
              theory of an algebraic group.  The principal investigator will                 
              study the compatibility of the Jantzen filtrations for Weyl                    
              modules and quantum Weyl modules; the structure of Weyl modules                
              with highest weights in the non-generic position; and the                      
              structure of cohomology modules related to induction functors for              
              both the algebraic group and the quantum groups, and the                       
              relations between them.                                                        
                   A group is an algebraic structure with an operation defined               
              on it.  A group is called an algebraic group if its elements                   
              satisfy a polynomial identity.  Algebraic groups are important                 
              for several different areas of mathematics, as well as physics.
