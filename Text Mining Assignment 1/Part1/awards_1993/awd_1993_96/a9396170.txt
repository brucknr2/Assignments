Abstract    :
                   This Presidential Young Investigator Award supports the                   
              mathematical work of Professor Frederic Bien of Princeton                      
              University. Dr. Bien's research aim is to bring to bear on                     
              several problems in mathematics and science his expertise in the               
              representation theory of groups. Within mathematics, he will work              
              on deciding precisely which nonlinear differential equations can               
              be integrated by the inverse spectral transform. In theoretical                
              computer science, Dr. Bien will work on expanding graphs, which                
              may model ideal communication networks. He will also apply his                 
              knowledge to the field of neural networks.                                     
                   Group theory began in the early nineteenth century as a                   
              description of operations that might be done successively, and                 
              also undone, as a ninety-degree clockwise rotation is undone by                
              the ninety-degree counterclockwise rotation. Lie groups were                   
              developed in the late part of that century by the path breaking                
              Norwegian mathematician Sophus Lie, who was interested in the                  
              most fundamental questions concerning differential equations.                  
              Now, one hundred years later, group theory pervades modern                     
              science, and the utility of Lie groups in many branches of                     
              mathematics, as well as in physics, has continued undiminished.
