Abstract    :
              The activities to be undertaken under this Research Planning                   
              Grant are focused on the preliminary  formulation of an improved               
              method for investigating structure acoustics problems having                   
              significant damping. During the course of the effort, several                  
              appropriate  models of a duct and other type endosures having                  
              sound absorptive materials will be formulated and investigated.                
              This preliminary work coupled with consultation with leaders in                
              the field, is expected to lead to the development of a highly                  
              competitive, sharply focused, research proposal within the field               
              of structural dynamics.***//
