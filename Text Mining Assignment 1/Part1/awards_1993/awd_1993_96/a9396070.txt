Abstract    :
                   Early to Late Silurian limestones from the Heceta Formation               
              record the earliest occurrence of widespread carbonate deposition              
              in the region and represent the earliest foundation for shallow                
              water platform development within the arc.  The excellent                      
              preservation of shallow to deep subtidal deposits within the                   
              Alexander arc contrasts with the poor preservation of many marine              
              sediments that originated within other island arcs.  Hence, these              
              limestones provide important insights into the styles, processes               
              and bathymetry of carbonate deposition in tectonically active                  
              areas.  Although previously described as having a shallow marine               
              origin, the limestones from the Heceta Formation can be                        
              differentiated into shallow water platform, platform margin, and               
              slope facies.  Renewal support will enable PI to pursue topics                 
              that relate to: (1) the dynamics of reef sedimentation and                     
              carbonate platform development within the Alexander arc; (2)                   
              physical and biologic controls on stromatolite distribution                    
              within the arc; and (3) regional biogeographic correlations.  The              
              proposed research will involve field work and laboratory analyses              
              during a two-year period and will generate a model for carbonate               
              platform and reef evolution within a tectonic framework.  Results              
              of the proposed research will refine our understanding of                      
              Silurian reef evolution and decline in different tectonic                      
              settings, factors affecting Phanerozoic stromatolite development,              
              and the paleogeography of the Alexander terrane.
