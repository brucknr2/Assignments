Abstract    :
                   The importance of being able to decompose a large-scale                   
              engineering system into smaller subsystems which may be designed               
              independently (yet concurrently) and integrated into a whole cannot            
              be overemphasized.  Many algorithms for the analysis of decomposed             
              systems require that all variables, constraints, objectives and                
              linkages between subsystems be precisely identified and rigorously             
              specified.  In practice, this extremely rigorous definition of the             
              system and subsystems is often unattainable.                                   
                   The objective of this research is to develop a method of                  
              system analysis and synthesis based on the principles embodied in              
              fuzzy set theory; a mathematical approach that has been developed              
              to model imprecision rigorously. Specifically, the mathematics of              
              fuzzy set theory will be incorporated into methods for hierarchical            
              and non-hierarchical decomposition and resynthesis of problems.                
              The resulting procedures will be integrated to provide a powerful              
              tool for effecting the design of complex engineering systems                   
              through hierarchic and/or non-hierarchic decomposition in a fuzzy              
              design environment.
