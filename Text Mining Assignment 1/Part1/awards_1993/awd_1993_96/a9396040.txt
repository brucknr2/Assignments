Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The research planned in this proposal is directed towards                      
              obtaining preliminary data for a long-term project to study the                
              expression of protein kinase C (PKC) isozymes under conditions                 
              of cell proliferation and differentiation using the friend                     
              murine erythroleukemia (F-MEL) cell line as a model system.                    
              Studies involving the use of PKC cDNA probes to identify                       
              variations in total RNA preparations from differentiating and                  
              proliferating (non-differentiating) F-MEL cells are proposed to                
              characterize the possible role of PKC in the processes of                      
              differentiation and proliferation.
