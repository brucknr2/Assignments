Abstract    :
              9350865  Timmerman  Mechatronics is a new area of manufacturing engineering
              science  where mechanical, electronic, and computer components are  employed
              using a concurrent design philosophy. The lack of  content in the standard
              Mechanical Engineering curriculum in  the areas of microprocessors, computer
              interfaces, and  communications oriented programming presents exceptional 
              challenges to Mechanical Engineering students who need to  master mechatronics
              for industrial careers.                                               This
              project establishes a laboratory for a second course in  controls. The first
              course in controls includes traditional  classical controls subjects such as
              Laplace transforms,  frequency domain design, and root locus design; and
              presents  the mathematical tools needed for industrial control practice.  This
              laboratory, for a second course in controls, continues  this subject by
              presenting the programming and interfacing  skills needed for the
              implementation of controls concepts on  the factory floor. The class is
              intended to fill the gap  between academic engineering knowledge and practical 
              engineering knowledge, and to prepare the student to be of  immediate use to
              industry upon graduation.  ***
