Abstract    :
              9350796  Byrd  In order to improve undergraduate instruction and enhance student
               achievement in freshman and sophomore science and mathematics  courses at
              Enterprise State Junior College, an interactive computer  facility will be
              established. More specifically, the goal of the  project is to improve
              mathematics and science instruction,  particularly for women, by allowing
              instructors to develop and  apply field tested courseware which will enhance
              conventional  instruction, provide for effective simulations and tutorials, and
               enable students to acquire skills in using modern laboratory  apparatus and
              instrumentation in the context of designing and  conducting meaningful
              scientific and mathematical inquiries. The  project will also add to the body
              of knowledge related to effective  instruction of undergraduates and serve as a
              model demonstration  center for other two-year colleges.
