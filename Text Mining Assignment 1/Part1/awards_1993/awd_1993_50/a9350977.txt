Abstract    :
              9350977  Pivonka     The project will purchase GC/MS instrumentation to enhance
              the  upper division laboratory requirement by revision of laboratory  exercises
              to focus on theory, techniques, operating parameters,  limitations, potential
              and understanding of laboratory  instrumentation.  The project will support
              industrial personnel  and life science majors in addition chemistry majors. 
              The  project will also support teacher training and inservice. A  completely
              revised, non-traditional approach which integrates  essential laboratory
              experiences with didactic instruction will  be offered.  ***
