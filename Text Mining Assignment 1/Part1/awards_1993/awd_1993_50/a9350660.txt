Abstract    :
              9350660  Hanson  Enhancement and Extension of Chromatography and Spectroscopy 
              Modules in the Curriculum  This project improves chemistry instruction by
              enhancing and  extending the department's chromatography and spectroscopy 
              laboratory capabilities by providing a modern, computer-  controlled gas
              chromatography/mass spectrometer  GC/MS  and  associated mass spectral library
              to be used in the majority of  the chemistry courses.  Students have hands-on
              experience with  GC/MS as early as the freshman year. GC/MS use is integrated 
              into the laboratories of 9 courses where GC separation and MS  identification
              is used by students to identify components in  environmental samples and
              student synthetic products, determine  isotope ratios, and analyze the
              structure of unknown chemical  compounds.  A unique feature of this project is
              the initiation  of a program to instruct all junior-level chemistry majors in 
              GC/MS theory and train them to become competent users of this  and other
              computer-controlled instruments.  ***y
