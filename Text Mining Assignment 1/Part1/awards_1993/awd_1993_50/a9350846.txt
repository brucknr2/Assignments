Abstract    :
              9350846  Illies                                                          The use
              of a massspectrometer is being integrated into  undergraduate teaching
              laboratories.  The Hewlett-Packard MS  Engine has a modern data system capable
              of true multi-tasking  and four attached personal computers allowing exposure
              of large  numbers of students to practical modern mass spectrometry.  The 
              degree of exposure and "hands on" use of the instrument  increases from the
              sophomore to the senior level.  Initial  student contact with the instrument is
              in the organic  laboratory where students are identifying the products of 
              simple synthetic reactions.  In physical chemistry, the  concepts of bond
              formation and reaction mechanisms are being  studied through ion-molecule
              reactions.  In the inorganic labs,  students routinely are using the instrument
              to analyze the  products of their inorganic syntheses, while in the analytical 
              laboratories, quantitative analysis of chlorinated hydrocarbons  and
              polychlorinated biphenyls is being carried out on water and  soil samples
              collected throughout the state.  Finally, students  are using the mass
              spectrometer in a number of undergraduate  research projects.  Careful choice
              of experiments, efficient  use of instrument time, and easy data access through
              multiple  computers are enabling us to expose large numbers of students  to
              practical "hands on" mass spectrometry.  A review of the  literature shows a
              marked deficiency in teaching mass  spectrometry at the undergraduate level. 
              This project is  providing a model for correcting that problem.  ***
