Abstract    :
              HRD-9350587  Cross, Dolores  Chicago State University    The Chicago Alliance
              for Minority Participation (CHAMP) is a  consortium of six Chicago area
              universities supported by a network  of local businesses, national
              laboratories, and local school  districts.  The six universities are: Chicago
              State University,  DePaul University, the Illinois Institute of Technology,
              Loyola  University, Northwestern University, and the University of Illinois  at
              Chicago.  These institutions enroll over 2,000 minorities a year  in science,
              engineering, and mathematics (SEM) fields.  The mission  of the Alliance is to
              significantly increase the quantity and  quality of minority students receiving
              SEM baccalaureate degrees  and to increase the pool of minority students
              entering graduate  school.  The Alliance will accomplish this goal by
              replicating  successful programs at new schools, by allowing students to 
              participate in bridge programs or research experiences outside  their own
              schools, by using the consortium to test new programs,  and by hosting
              consortium-wide activities such as an Alliance  Student Research Conference. 
              The Alliance partners believe that  such interactive and cooperative activities
              will give the  consortium a synergy that would not exist if these programs 
              operated in isolation.  The Alliance proposes two bold objectives:   (1) to
              quadruple the output of SEM baccalaureate degrees awarded to  minorities in
              Chicago so that a minimum of 1,000 minority students  per year will receive
              baccalaureate degrees in SEM fields by the  year 2000; and (2) to place at
              least 200 minority students per year  in SEM graduate programs by the year
              2000.
