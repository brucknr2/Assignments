Abstract    :
              This project is purchasing high performance (486DX) desk-top                   
              computing systems and printers, including one for color                        
              reproduction, in order to enhance a microcomputer-based                        
              laboratory program.  The students are being involved in (a)                    
              using new digital multimeter interface units and software                      
              currently under development by IBM in collaboration with one of                
              the faculty members, and (b) 3-D molecular modeling for                        
              visualization and computation. The equipment is being used in                  
              courses for majors at the freshman, sophomore, junior and                      
              senior level as well as by non-majors in a liberal arts course                 
              in physical science.  Students are performing precision                        
              electrochemical experiments using the interface devices. These                 
              allow direct measurement of current and/or voltage as a                        
              function of time or of keyboard input permitting the study of                  
              numerous chemical reactions and physical quantities. Data                      
              analysis and transformation using a full set of mathematical                   
              tools as well as graphical output to screen or printer also is                 
              being done. The molecular modeling software is introducing                     
              students to an important new tool for the chemist. They are                    
              learning to display and manipulate 3-D molecular structures, to                
              extract geometric or electronic properties and to perform                      
              calculations once reserved for high-end computer facilities.
