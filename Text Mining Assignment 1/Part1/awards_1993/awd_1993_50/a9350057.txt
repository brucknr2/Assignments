Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project is to host a conference, "Future Direction of                     
              Informal Science Education", for project directors of NSF-                     
              funded informal science education projects.  The purpose                       
              will be to:  promote communication, networking and                             
              collaboration; address common problems; discuss strategies                     
              for areas of concern; design future roles of projects for                      
              informal science education.  Themes for the conference will                    
              be serving underrepresented audiences, linkages with formal                    
              education and citywide systemic change, and assessing the                      
              impact of informal science education project.
