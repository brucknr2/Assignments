Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project is to design and develop a set of four video-                     
              based Scientists in Action episodes including a variety of                     
              hands-on activities that provide opportunities for students                    
              to work along with scientists (video-based) in using                           
              technology to solve environmental and human health problems.                   
              The video productions will be patterned after the Jasper                       
              series.  The first tape will be a re-shooting of the                           
              Overturned Tanker episode.  Topics of the other three tapes                    
              will be chosen with advice from students, teachers, the                        
              Internal Review Board and the National Advisory Committee.                     
              Software will be identified that can be linked to the video                    
              based materials.
