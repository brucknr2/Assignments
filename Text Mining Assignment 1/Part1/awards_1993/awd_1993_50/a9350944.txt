Abstract    :
              9350944  Fonda        This proposal concerns five field-oriented courses that
              partially  or totally involve the student in studies of a wide variety of 
              aquatic ecosystems.  Physical and chemical variables are emphasized  and are
              measured using Hydrolab multiparameter water measurement  systems with
              dedicated computer support. Also, students are able to  construct accurate
              profiles and to describe completely the spatial  and temporal patterns in these
              bodies of water. In particular, the  Hydrolab allows faculty to work
              efficiently with small groups of  students on concurrent measurements. The
              inclusion of computer  analysis introduces students to modern techniques of
              environmental  monitoring, data analysis, and graphing.    ***
