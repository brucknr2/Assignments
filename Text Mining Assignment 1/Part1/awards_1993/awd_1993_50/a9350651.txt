Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to better prepare students of computer             
              science/software engineering, both majors and minors, in the areas             
              of hardware-dependent software development. A laboratory built                 
              around the central theme of the interdependence of software and                
              hardware in computer, as well as embedded, systems will be                     
              developed. This laboratory will serve as the hands on and                      
              experimentation center for three courses; Computer Architecture,               
              Microprocessor Systems, and Real-Time Software Systems.                        
              Students graduating from such a program, will have had hands-on                
              experiences with interfacing, data acquisition, real-time                      
              programming, and observing the physical results of numerically                 
              computed solutions to problems. They will be better prepared                   
              for positions as systems developers and/or applications                        
              programmers to work as members of computing and/or embedded                    
              systems development teams. Likewise, the laboratory to support                 
              this series of courses will better prepare students for                        
              graduate school.
