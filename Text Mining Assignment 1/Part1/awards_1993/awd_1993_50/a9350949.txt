Abstract    :
              9350949  Robert Badger  This project is using a petrographic microscope with
              35mm and  video camera, an in-lab computer work station and some computer 
              software as part of a project that is integrating two upper-  level geology
              courses, Structural Geology and Petrology.  The  project is developing
              field-oriented student research that  encompasses and synthesizes elements of
              both disciplines.  The  project involves an investigation of a well-exposed
              mylonite  zone located approximately 10 miles from campus.  Students  first are
              studying it as part of a petrology project; the  following semester they are
              continuing their research on the  mylonite zone as part of a class project in
              structural geology,  incorporating their data from the petrology class. 
              Critical to  this project is the ability of the students to work 
              cooperatively. Groups are working on different parts of the  mylonite zone, so
              they are sharing their data and are working  together to formulate ideas and
              working models.    ***
