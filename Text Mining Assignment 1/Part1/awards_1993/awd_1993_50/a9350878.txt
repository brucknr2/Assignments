Abstract    :
              The computer is revolutionizing the teaching of physics, both                  
              in the laboratory and in the classroom.   A computer-integrated                
              approach in the classroom allows students to study in detail                   
              situations where analytic solutions are impossible.  It also                   
              frees them from tedious hand calculations, thus allowing more                  
              time for consideration of the essential aspects of the                         
              problem.The computer revolution has been under way for some                    
              time in the Furman Physics Department, where we have begun to                  
              use computer simulations as classroom demonstrations, to give                  
              course assignments involving computer-aided computation and                    
              graphing, to use computer-interfaced laboratory equipment for                  
              the collection and analysis of data, and to work with students                 
              on individual computer-related projects. This award is                         
              providing the computer hardware and software needed to expand                  
              our current usage of the computer to involve all students                      
              taking courses in three target areas: classical physics,                       
              quantum mechanics, and computational physics.  Specifically,                   
              the award has provided an eight station networked computer                     
              facility with a file server, compute server host, along with                   
              general-purpose and applications software.
