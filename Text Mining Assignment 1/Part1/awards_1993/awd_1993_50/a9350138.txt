Abstract    :
              9350138  Navarro    The El Paso USI will be implemented through the El Paso 
              Collaborative for Academic Excellence, an organization of school  district
              superintendents, university officials, civic leaders and  the mayor. The
              Collaborative will focus on three areas:  establishing community consensus on a
              set of competencies;   determining current policies and practices that affect
              mathematics  and science; developing comprehensive plans for change that build 
              upon district strengths. Upon completion of the self study, the El  Paso USI
              will continue with the development of a comprehensive plan  for change for the
              district that will build on identified strengths  and focus attention on areas
              of greatest need.    The University of Texas at El Paso will house the
              Collaborative and  provide leadership over USI activities.     The award period
              is for 12 months.  ***
