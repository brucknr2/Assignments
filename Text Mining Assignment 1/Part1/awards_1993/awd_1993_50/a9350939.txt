Abstract    :
              9350939  Freed  The Geology Department is using a Philips PW 1840 automated X- 
              ray diffractometer system which to enhance both undergraduate  courses and
              undergraduate research. The goal is to integrate  use of the diffractometer
              into three components of Trinity's  science curriculum: (1) the beginning
              Physical Geology course;  (2) the geology major, specifically student research
              projects  and three required sequential courses for the major (Mineralogy  &
              Crystallography, Igneous & Metamorphic Petrology, and  Stratigraphy &
              Sedimentation); and (3) laboratory exercises in  engineering and physics
              classes (Engineering Materials and  Condensed Matter Physics). Beginning
              geology students use  modern analytical X-ray equipment as an integral part of 
              examining minerals and rocks. Advanced students are using the  instrument to
              study mineral identification techniques,  understand crystallographic
              relationships, investigate  compositional and structural variations in
              minerals, and work  with multiple-phase systems, such as sediments or
              fine-grained  igneous or metamorphic rocks. After completing the required 
              course sequence, geology majors have the experience necessary  to use the
              diffractometer for addressing mineralogical problems  in a research context.
              The diffractometer significantly expands  the types of research projects that
              students can undertake.  ***
