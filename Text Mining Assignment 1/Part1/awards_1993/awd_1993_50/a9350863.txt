Abstract    :
              9350863  Bottomley  The faculty in the School of Chemistry and Biochemistry has
              been in  the process of incorporating polymer chemistry into its  undergraduate
              curriculum.  Four curriculum changes are underway:  (1) offering new courses in
              polymer chemistry; (2) creating a  polymer option for chemistry majors; (3)
              incorporating lectures  dealing with and experiments demonstrating the
              principles of  polymer synthesis, characterization and processing into the 
              undergraduate chemistry courses; (4) offering workshops in polymer  chemistry
              to faculty in small colleges and universities in the  Southeast.  The focus of
              each lecture and the workshops is the  relationship between molecular structure
              and the reactivity,  properties and processing conditions of the polymer.  The
              intent of  each of the experiments which are being developed is to demonstrate 
              real world applications of analytical techniques and how these  analyses are
              used in the design of new materials with useful  properties for specific
              applications.  A new TGA-DSC-FTIR is now  being used to provide students with
              experience in the synthesis,  characterization and processing of polymers in
              the laboratory.      ***
