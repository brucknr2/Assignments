Abstract    :
              9350513  Rossman    The Midwest Public Garden Collaborative (MPGC), a consortium
               of 5 public garden and arboreta, recognized for their  leadership and
              contributions in public science education,  seeks support to develop a series
              of instructional materials  entitled Discovery Units.  These Units will link
              classrooms  to public gardens with investigations and study that will  occur
              before, during and after a public garden field trip.   Field trips will be
              planned as an integral part of the  overall science instruction program.  This
              cooperative  partnership project has the potential of reaching 100,000 
              elementary students and 4,000 of their teachers each year.  ***
