Abstract    :
              The undergraduate curriculum in bioprocess technology                          
              (sequential courses in Recombinant DNA Biochemistry,                           
              Fermentation Biology, Protein Purification and Downstream                      
              Processing, and Scale-Up of Fermentation and Downstream                        
              Processing followed by a senior research project) is integrated                
              about a single model system (E. coli -galactosidase                           
              production).  The iterative interdisciplinary nature of                        
              recombinant product development is emphasized.
