Abstract    :
                                          ABSTRACT  9350484  Falmagne         This project
              develops an interactive student assessment  computer system to be used in
              grades 4 to 8.  This expert system,  where subsequent questions are based on
              previous responses,  provides a report for each student delivered in everyday
              language  and which describes the student's current strengths and weaknesses 
              relative to the appropriate mathematics curriculum.  The report  makes specific
              recommendations and provides a printout of critical  question missed with
              annotated solutions.  The results for each  student are advisory to the
              classroom teacher.  Each student  session is completed in a short amount of
              time.  The system  considers cultural and social diversity and is constructed
              to  accept "open" responses to the questions.  The system requires the 
              identification and construction of a "knowledge space" which  includes a
              suitable family of "knowledge states," revised and  refined through peer
              review.  Both the development and initial  implementation take place in
              exemplary schools in Orange County  California.  ***
