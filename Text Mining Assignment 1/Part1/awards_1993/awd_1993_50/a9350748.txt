Abstract    :
              9350748  Jackson                                                             The
              goal of this project is to introduce scientific computation and  simulation
              techniques into the undergraduate curriculum at Central  Michigan University. 
              To this end, a laboratory-based course is  being created as a part of the
              Physics curriculum and offered as an  elective to students in the other
              sciences.  The course will be  taught as an in-class lab, where the students
              run simulation  experiments in the class and discuss the results, as well as
              any  difficulties, with the instructors on the spot.  Our team-teaching 
              approach, pairing a Physicist and a Computer Scientist, stresses  sound
              programming practices - modular design, proper documentation  and program
              efficiency - as well as standard numerical and  simulation techniques. 
              Computer simulations allow the students to  experiment with realistic systems
              which cannot be handled by  traditional analytical methods. The course includes
              a selection of  real-world problems from various scientific disciplines to 
              illustrate and emphasize the power and broad applicability of the 
              computational techniques. The in-class lab format and mix of  student
              backgrounds lead to a productive exchange of ideas and a  better awareness of
              the unity of the underlying science.    ***
