Abstract    :
              A computer laboratory for enhancing the teaching and learning                  
              of calculus will be established. The investigators have                        
              developed open-ended laboratory projects to be worked by teams                 
              of students. The proposed laboratory will allow further                        
              implementation of Georgia Tech's Calculus Reform program. The                  
              laboratory will be used by students working on team projects                   
              and will be used for in-class instruction on the use of the                    
              computer algebra system Mathematica.
