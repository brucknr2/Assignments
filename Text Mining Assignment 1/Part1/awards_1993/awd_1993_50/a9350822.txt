Abstract    :
              9350822  Mertzman  The EDAX Component of a Scanning Electron Microscope         
                    An energy dispersive x-ray microanalytical system (EDAX)  for a scanning
              electron microscope is being used by the  students in the geosciences
              department and to a lesser extent  by students in physics and biology.  The
              curriculum is being  impacted by this instrumentation throughout the four year 
              undergraduate experience.  To get the students excited about  science and to
              show them what is possible in order to fire  their imaginations, students are
              making use of the  instrumentation at least twice in each of the introductory 
              courses, dynamic earth and oceanography. Sophomore and junior  required
              geosciences courses, particularly the lab experiences  in sedimentology,
              mineralogy, petrology, structure, and  paleontology are being modified
              considerably in light of access  to this instrumentation.  The microworld is
              now accessible to  chemical characterization in addition to the macroworld. 
              The  breadth of experience, the depth, and the sheer number of  undergraduate
              research opportunities is being substantially  increased. Students from outside
              our institution are being  impacted by this improvement, too, through our very
              active  participation with eleven other geology departments in the Keck 
              Geology Consortium.   ***y
