Abstract    :
                   This SGER proposes to do exploratory research to determine                
              impediment to implement reform strategies in freshman mathematics              
              so as to increase the participation and success rate of minority               
              students in those courses.  The research builds upon similar work              
              in other campus settings (specifically that of Treisman at the                 
              University of California, Berkeley) but is exploratory in that it              
              seeks to apply the model to colleges in the New Jersey system.                 
                   Three kinds of research questions are to be addressed: (1) to             
              document the nature of mathematical experiences that take place                
              using a variety of kinds of data; (2) to analyze the nature of                 
              organizational issues that attempts to reform mathematics education            
              at the lower division level; (3) to attempt to identify strategies             
              for addressing the variety of barriers to reform that are                      
              encountered in this sort of reform.//
