Abstract    :
              9350746  Hampton     Modern biological research  and its technological
              applications  have come to rely heavily on our abilities to understand 
              mathematical concepts, apply statistical reasoning, and process  and interpret
              data through the use of computers. This project  is designed to enhance these
              skills among undergraduate  students. A key component is a new computer
              laboratory which  includes microcomputers networked together plus software 
              packages needed for specific classroom exercises. The principal  undergraduate
              course that utilizes the computers, Biological  Statistics, is a required
              course for all biology majors. Also,  computer-assisted exercises are being
              developed to improve  understanding of fundamental biological principles, the 
              scientific method, or specific quantitative skills of  particular importance to
              biologists.  ***
