Abstract    :
                9350464  Chan     This project is one of NSF Presidential Faculty Fellows 
              (PFF) program projects.  This PFF awardee plans to study  systematically the
              grain boundaries in ceria (CeO2), a fast  ionic conductor, and in YBCO
              (YBa2Cu3O7-x), a high  temperature oxide superconductor.  The study will relate
              the  structure and chemistry of the boundaries with their  electrical
              properties.  This PFF awardee will intends to  develop new teaching courses as
              well as using experiments  and interactive computer graphics to enhance student
               learning.  %%%  This is one of the NSF presidential faculty fellows  (PFF)
              award.  The research activities of the awardee will be  concerned with the
              study of the grain boundaries in oxides.  One fast ion conductor, namely,
              ceria, and one high  temperature oxide superconductor, namely, YBCO, will be 
              selected for this study.  Efforts will be used to relate the  structure and
              chemistry of the boundaries with their  electrical properties.  In teaching,
              this PFF awardee plans  to develop new courses as well as using experiments and
               interactive graphics to enhance student learning.  ***
