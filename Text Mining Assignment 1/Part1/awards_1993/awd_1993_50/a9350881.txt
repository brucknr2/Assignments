Abstract    :
              9350881  Priest  In Fall 1989, the Miami University Department of Physics 
              initiated a new Introductory Level Physics Sequence of courses  emphasizing
              laboratory experience.  Building upon the first-  year course, which contains
              major units on 2Oth century  physics, we introduced at the Sophomore level a
              course in  Contemporary Physics, which focuses on recent important physics 
              research results obtained within the students' lifetime.  The  Contemporary
              Physics Laboratory gives the students "hands-on"  experience needed to
              understand the significance of these  recent results. The laboratory is
              organized into three  categories each having a focus: I. "Waves are Particles
              are  Waves", Focus: The Scanning Tunneling Microscope, II. "From  Atoms to
              Solids", Focus: High-Tc Superconductivity, and III.  "Four, Three, Two? One?
              ...Countdown the Forces of Nature",  Focus: The Standard Model.  This project
              provides instrumentation for experiments in  scanning tunneling microscopy to
              illustrate particle-wave  duality and tunneling through a potential barrier,
              and provides  students with a valuable transferable skill. The equipment is 
              sufficiently sophisticated for use in advanced level individual  student
              projects, involving microscopic studies of surfaces.  ***
