Abstract    :
              9350256  GRAUER  This award provides support to Dr. Anne Grauer under the
              National  Science Foundation's Presidential Faculty Fellows (PFF) Program.  The
              PFF Program was established at the request of the President of  the United
              States to recognize and support the scholarly activities  of some of the
              Nation's most outstanding science and engineering  faculty members early in
              their careers.  Awards are intended to  allow Fellows to undertake
              self-designed, innovative research and  teaching projects, to establish
              research and teaching programs, and  to pursue other academic related
              activities.    This award will allow the investigator to pursue her research 
              interests in the patterns of health and disease in historic  populations as a
              means towards reconstructing the past.  In the  reconstruction of history,
              reliance has been placed upon  documentary sources which are often biased and
              frequently reflect  the lives of wealthy and well-educated adult males. 
              Comparably  less is known about the health, disease and lives of women, 
              children, and the poor.  Dr. Grauer, using paleodemographic and 
              paleopathological techniques, will focus her research on this  "forgotten"
              population.  Specifically, she will excavate the 19th  century Almshouse
              Cemetery near Milwaukee which provides a large  sample of over 1200 individuals
              and well preserved skeletal  remains.  The goals of the research are to
              reconstruct patterns of  health and disease, explore the biases of these same
              scientific  techniques through the analysis of the historical documentation, 
              and formulate hypotheses concerning human adaptation in urban  environments
              under extreme conditions, with particular emphasis  being placed upon
              adaptations made by women and children and the  poor.    This research promises
              to make an important contribution to our  understanding of the history of the
              urban poor.  Also, this five  year award will provide an opportunity for the
              investigator, who  is an exceptional and innovative teacher, to train
              undergraduate  a nd graduate students in biological anthropology.  ***
