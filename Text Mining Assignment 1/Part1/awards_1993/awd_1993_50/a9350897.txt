Abstract    :
              9350897  Leung  The proposed work involves the further development and 
              improvement of a number of experiments in a Modern Optics  Laboratory course
              emphasizing light interactions with matter,  laser properties and modern
              optical techniques.  The aim of the  course is to enable students to make more
              precise measurements,  advance beyond the fundamentals and become familiar with
              the  latest equipment. The project is part of the planned  development of an
              optics center at the university.  One central  piece of equipment is a
              programmable VIS/UV spectrophotometer.   This allows students to measure
              accurately the oscillator  strength of rhodamine 6G in water for the experiment
              dealing  with the classical dispersion theory, the absorption spectrum  of CdS
              in an experiment dealing with band-gap energy, and the  absorption spectrum of
              leaded glass in an experiment concerning  Faraday rotation.  The light
              scattering experiment will be  improved with an argon-ion laser and a photon
              counter system.   Students can measure the intensity of light at different
              lasing  wavelengths, as well as different scattering angles.  With a  dye laser
              pumped with a nitrogen laser, students measure the  response time of CdS
              photodetectors.  It is important that  students have a concept of response time
              of a detector. For  optical filtering experiments, students use a new optical 
              imaging system consisting of a CCD camera, a frame grabber and  a personal
              computer to record the filtered images and analyze  them precisely.  For an
              electrooptics experiment, students  control the function of a Pockels cell and
              analyze the state of  light passing through the cell with a computer.  Finally
              a new  experiment illustrates the powerful technique of optical  modulation and
              demodulation using a photoelastic modulator and  a phase-sensitive detector.
