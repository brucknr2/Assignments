Abstract    :
              9350902  Dugan  The project creates an instrumentation repair and maintenance 
              service for small colleges in Appalachia and surrounding regions in  Kentucky,
              Virginia, West Virginia, North Carolina, and Tennessee.   These small academic
              institutions must buy and use modern  scientific instruments so their mostly
              rural students are not at a  disadvantage compared to those at major
              universities.  Factory  service for these instruments is, however,
              prohibitively expensive,  and they are often idle when in need of repair due to
              this high  cost.  This program addresses this need by utilizing the service 
              infrastructure at the University of Kentucky College of Engineering  as a
              support base of technical expertise to keep these instruments  operational at
              affordable costs to the small colleges.  Startup  funding is being provided by
              the grant, and through user fees the  colleges are contributing an increasing
              share of the costs as the  program becomes fully established.
