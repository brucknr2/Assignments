Abstract    :
              Indiana University Purdue University in Indianapolis                           
              (IUPUI) is modernizing and further developing their                            
              undergraduate teaching laboratories, which comprise the                        
              research methods component of the psychology major.  The                       
              introductory laboratory course, which provides the first                       
              psychology laboratory experience for undergraduate majors at                   
              IUPUI, is the primary target for development. With the addition                
              of this new laboratory they are computerizing experimental                     
              protocols and data analyses, introducing students to research                  
              as it is conducted in the modern psychology laboratory.                        
              Numerous improvements and developments are afforded by the                     
              equipment, including increased precision of controlling stimuli                
              and recording responses, and standardization across different                  
              lab sections.  In addition, students in upper division                         
              laboratories and those enrolled in independent research courses                
              are benefiting from the new equipment.  Having learned the                     
              fundamentals of the experiment generating software in                          
              Introductory Laboratory, advanced students are designing and                   
              carrying out independent research projects.
