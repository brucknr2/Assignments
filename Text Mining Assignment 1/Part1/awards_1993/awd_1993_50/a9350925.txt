Abstract    :
              The project will incorporate modern molecular modeling and                     
              computational chemistry methods throughout the undergraduate                   
              chemistry curriculum.  Implementation of this project will                     
              involve establishing a network of high resolution graphics                     
              workstations equipped with sophisticated molecular modeling                    
              software packages to emphasize visualization of the three-                     
              dimensional aspects of molecular structure of both small                       
              molecules and biologically important macromolecules,                           
              visualization of physical/ chemical properties of molecules and                
              how they relate to structure, and an introduction to the wide                  
              range of molecular orbital theory/quantum mechanics based                      
              computational methods now available as tools in the arsenal of                 
              the modern practicing chemist. Students will use molecular                     
              modeling to generate structures, calculate energy minimized                    
              geometries exploring the stereochemical aspects of how the                     
              molecule "fills space", calculate and display LUMO's and HOMO's                
              in 3D, explore the notion of stereoselective chemical                          
              reactivity in terms of the three-dimensional relationship of                   
              LUMO's and HOMO's to molecular structure, predict the                          
              stereochemical selectivity of a borohydride reduction and                      
              compare their results to experiment, import X-ray crystal                      
              structures of proteins and explore the motifs of substructure                  
              and the concept of macromolecular surface topology, assign the                 
              vibrational spectra of gas phase molecules and compare their                   
              results to experiment.
