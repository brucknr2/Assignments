Abstract    :
              9350314  Aelion  This is an award to support research the  objective of which is
              to study the  decontamination of groundwater by enhancement  of microbial
              activities in aquifers  undergoing decontamination procedures.  The 
              investigator plans on assessing microbial  contributions to contaminant removal
              at field  sites being subjected to different types of  bioremediation
              procedures and comparing the  results obtained from different contaminated 
              sites.    This is the initial increment of an award to  provide support for
              this project.  The  investigator has been designated as a  Presidential Faculty
              Fellow.  The nomination  for this award was made in accord with  criteria
              contained in the FY 1993  Presidential Faculty Fellows Program  Announcement
              and Guidelines for Submission of  Nominations, NSF 92-84.
