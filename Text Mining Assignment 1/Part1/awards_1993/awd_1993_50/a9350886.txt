Abstract    :
              This project provides for the purchase of equipment for a                      
              modular laser-based spectroscopy and kinetics laboratory to be                 
              used in the teaching of physical, instrumental, analytical, and                
              biochemistry courses. The equipment includes a diode laser and                 
              a nitrogen-laser pumped dye lasers, monochromators, and                        
              detection electronics (both PMT and CCD). With this equipment,                 
              students in instrumental and physical chemistry courses will be                
              able to easily and rapidly construct apparatus for the                         
              measurement of Raman spectra, fluorescence spectra (laser and                  
              lamp excitation), interferometry, two-photon spectroscopy, and                 
              rapid kinetics (flash photolysis). The equipment is designed                   
              for maximum versatility in experimental design and a minimum of                
              instructor intervention. Two configurations (Raman and                         
              fluorescence spectrometers) will be used throughout the                        
              curriculum as state-of-the-art instructional instruments. The                  
              equipment will also be available for undergraduate research                    
              projects.
