Abstract    :
              9350772  Jenkins  A series of laboratory experiments, based on the use of a 
              microcomputer, is being developed for a one-year, introductory  physics course.
               The experiments are using a Macintosh  microcomputer in a traditional two-hour
              period supervised by  graduate teaching assistants.  The computer allows
              real-time  acquisition of data and, by simplifying data collection, it permits 
              the study of phenomena with different experimental situations in  the two-hour
              lab period.  In addition, the computer simplifies data  analysis through the
              use of spread sheets and graphics packages.   Interactive tutorials with
              graphics and animations illustrate  concepts and show their relationship to
              real life experiences.  The experiments make use of the Authorware software to
              provide an  interactive experiment for students performing the laboratory 
              experiments.  Authorware is a software developmental tool for  creating
              instructional presentations including tutorials and  simulations.  Virginia
              Tech has acquired a site license for this  software allowing free access to the
              software by both faculty and  students.  The experiments incorporate materials
              developed for the  program Tools for Scientific Thinking from Tufts University
              as well  as concepts from Workshop Physics from Dickinson College.  With an
              annual enrollment of over 500 students, good statistics are  being obtained of
              measurements of changes in performance by pre-  and post- testing.
