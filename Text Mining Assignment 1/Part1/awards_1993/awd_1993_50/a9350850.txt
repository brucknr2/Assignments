Abstract    :
              9350850  McGranaghan      This project will allow the introduction of a
              Fluorescence  Spectrophotometer into the chemistry curriculum. Fluorescence 
              experiments will be added to the laboratory exercises scheduled  for general,
              organic, physical, analytical, and biochemical  courses. It will also be used
              in projects designed for Honors  or Senior Research. This project will increase
              the knowledge  and skills of undergraduate women science students as they 
              prepare for careers in science, medicine or education.  ***
