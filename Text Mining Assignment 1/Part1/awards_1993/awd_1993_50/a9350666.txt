Abstract    :
              9350666  Vaughn  This project provides computing equipment and software for a
              remote  sensing and geographic information systems (GIS) laboratory to 
              implement a program in applied geospatial analysis. Some exercises  focus on
              digital image processing and GIS modeling. Other  laboratory exercises address
              such topics as terrain analysis and  classification, georectification, and GIS
              spatial modeling. The  operating premise is to provide a sufficient measure of
              training to  enable students to compete for jobs in spatial analysis including 
              GIS and digital image processing, or to continue on into graduate  school with
              a high probability of success. It is expected that the  exercises employed
              throughout the five courses in GIS and remote  sensing will provide the
              foundation for subsequent research  projects and  formal presentations. Also,
              upon completion of the  courses, students will be placed in internships and
              summer jobs  related to applications in GIS and image processing.   ***
