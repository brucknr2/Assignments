Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              The Ecological Society of America (ESA) has taken an active                    
              leadership role in creating regional alliances of ecologists                   
              and educators.  ESA has held a highly successful conference                    
              on K-12 ecological education in conjunction with a meeting                     
              of the Association of Southeastern Biologists.  This                           
              conference was attended by a team from each state,                             
              consisting of one or two ecological researchers, teachers,                     
              science education administrators, and education faculty                        
              members.  Team members heard presentations on recent                           
              developments in pre-college ecological education, and they                     
              collaborated on an action plan for their respective states.                    
              The action plans and meeting proceedings were subsequently                     
              published in an ESA bulletin.  The Society has planned a                       
              similar conference for the Rocky Mountain region. Ecological                   
              education in this region is made more difficult by the high                    
              level of ecological diversity in the area, and the                             
              difficulties of travel for parts of the year.                                  
                                                                                             
              The proposed Rocky Mountain conference will create benefits                    
              throughout the region and beyond.  Once established,                           
              regional alliances such as this will be pivotal in                             
              implementing a national approach to ecological education.                      
              Conferences such as these capture the active participation                     
              of scientists in pre-college science education, create                         
              action plans for implementation, and solidify partnerships                     
              for educational improvement.                                                   
                                                                                             
              Cost sharing represents 26% of the NSF contribution.
