Abstract    :
              Ithaca College will purchase an FT-IR for use in all of its                    
              undergraduate chemistry laboratory courses for science majors                  
              and its research programs.  Acquisition of this computer-                      
              controlled instrument with a wide spectral range, excellent                    
              resolution and extensive data manipulation capabilities will                   
              enhance the integrated laboratory program.  The instrument will                
              allow students to do better structure determinations and obtain                
              more and better data than is possible with their present                       
              instruments. Biology, biochemistry and chemistry majors will                   
              all benefit from the instrument. This spectrophotometer will                   
              also be used by research students both during the semesters and                
              in the summer. Some high school students doing research in the                 
              summer are also expected to benefit. The instrument also be                    
              networked to improve the teaching in many of the chemistry                     
              lecture courses as well as in the discussion portions of the                   
              laboratory courses.
