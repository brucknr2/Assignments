Abstract    :
              9350523  Ridd    A growing world-wide supply of environmental data, the 
              availability of sophisticated and inexpensive computer-based  hardware, and the
              development of user-friendly, flexible  software makes possible the development
              of modules which can  put students in touch with the world at any scale from
              the  locality of the student to the world at large.  Many  national and
              international organizations are networked and  committed to collecting and
              sharing increasing volumes of  Earth-environmental data.  There is a growing
              awareness of  global change and environmental stress and the  responsibility
              humans have for these conditions and their  amelioration.  Students can and
              should be part of the quest  to explore these questions in new ways.  Through
              hands-on,  image analysis and Geographic Information Systems (GIS)  digital map
              manipulation, secondary school students can  overlay remote-sensed data to see
              vital relations at the  interface between humans and the natural world.  Two 
              modules, of two weeks duration, are developed in this pilot  project:  One is
              global in perspective such as  decertification or tropical deforestation; the
              other  concerns local conditions such as water use.  The modules  are developed
              by teachers, science educators and scientists  working together and are field
              tested in diverse locations.   The software runs on a 386 equivalent computer
              with enough  memory to accommodate ArcView files and 4 MB of RAM.  The  project
              is governed by a national advisory board and has two  external evaluators to
              document the effects on students and  teachers.  ***
