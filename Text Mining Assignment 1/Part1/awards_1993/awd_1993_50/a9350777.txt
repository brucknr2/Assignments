Abstract    :
              Seeing is Believing: An Investigative Microscopy Project for                   
              Introductory Biology Students                                                  
                  This is an investigative process oriented microscopy                       
              project in an Introductory Biology Course for majors.  This                    
              project facilitates learning basic microscopy and also teaches                 
              observation, critical thinking, and research skills.  Students                 
              use both light and scanning electron microscopes as                            
              investigative tools.  The photomicrography equipment enables                   
              students to record data about chosen specimens and subsequently                
              analyze structure (i.e., measuring size of various cellular                    
              features, etc.). The scanning electron microscopy (SEM)                        
              provides greater levels of resolution, and the opportunity to                  
              do comparative structural analysis in addition to its function                 
              of recording data. Implementation of this project will improve                 
              the quality of the laboratory experience in an Introductory                    
              Biology Course. It will allow beginning students hands-on                      
              access to modern instrumentation, improve research skills, and                 
              provide opportunities for a process oriented learning                          
              experience rather than the traditional cookbook approach.
