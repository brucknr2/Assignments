Abstract    :
              This project provides improved learning opportunities in                       
              mathematics, chemistry and physics for engineering majors                      
              through the creation of a microcomputer laboratory designed to                 
              support instruction in these courses.To demystify the abstract                 
              nature of these courses, engineering majors need an environment                
              in which they can interact with one another in working complex                 
              experiments and in solving problems with an increased                          
              interdisciplinary base. An instructor-developed program to                     
              track both student time and their level of success on computer                 
              assignments will become an integral part of these courses.                     
              Feedback from the program will advise students of their                        
              progress toward skill development in time to secure assistance,                
              if necessary. Feedback to the instructor regarding the nature                  
              and extent of student progress toward required skills will                     
              allow the learning process to inform the teaching process on a                 
              cyclical basis.To implement the proposed change in the                         
              instructional process within math and science courses, a series                
              of computer modules will be created to support the new                         
              methodology. These modules will be based on existing course                    
              topics but designed to provide students with the opportunity                   
              to: Practice with problem solving; Discover underlying concepts                
              and principles; Interrelate learning between disciplines;                      
              Investigate complex and tedious problems; and, Compete                         
              effectively in an increasingly technologically literate and                    
              student population.
