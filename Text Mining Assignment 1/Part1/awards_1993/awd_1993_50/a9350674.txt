Abstract    :
              9350674  Smith  This proposal presents a plan for expanding and enhancing 
              undergraduate laboratory and research opportunities in  neurophysiology,
              neuropharmacology and introductory  neuroscience. This will be accomplished by
              purchasing computers  with analog to digital conversion and hard disk storage 
              capability, by buying data collection and analysis software,  and by purchasing
              equipment enabling hippocampal slice  experiments to be conducted. The
              acquisition of this equipment  will allow us to better meet the heavy
              enrollment demands for  our lab courses. It will give the 80-100 students who
              enroll  each year in these courses a greater opportunity for hands-on 
              laboratory work. Finally, the quality of the laboratories will  be enhanced
              because students will be able to store data for  further analysis, making data
              analysis and thinking about data  an integral part of the student laboratory
              experience.  ***
