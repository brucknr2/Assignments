Abstract    :
              9350641  Skadron       Accelerating innovations in computer technology have
              changed  the nature of the discovery process in physics and have created 
              opportunities to rethink the undergraduate physics curriculum. The  present
              project is a product of such an effort.  The goal is to  create a modern
              computational facility for the entire undergraduate  physics program.  Majors
              moving through the physics sequence are  learning computational techniques
              alongside the physics and are  using these techniques to enhance their
              understanding of the  physics.  Students are gaining several distinct benefits
              from the  modernized curriculum:  a). the computational component of the 
              curriculum broadens each course by enabling students to examine  realistic
              effects usually neglected when only analytical methods  are used; b). newly
              gained computational skills enable  undergraduates to make meaningful
              contributions to the Department's  undergraduate research participation
              programs; and c). students  carry powerful problem-solving tools to graduate
              school or the work  force.  ***
