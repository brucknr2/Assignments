Abstract    :
              The project will develop a unified physical chemistry lab for                  
              the study of thermodynamics and kinetics in which some                         
              traditional as well as novel experiments are all related to                    
              nonequilibrium chemical self-organization. The Belousov-                       
              Zhabotinskii oscillating reaction will be the major focus.                     
              Students will study the phenomenology and dynamic behavior                     
              through "hands on" experiments via electrochemical techniques,                 
              calorimetry and video analysis (for the quantitative study of                  
              spatial phenomena). The polymerization of methacrylic acid will                
              be studied with video analysis of propagating reaction fronts                  
              and viscometry of the product polymer. All experiments will use                
              computer data acquisition with comparison to numerical models.
