Abstract    :
              9350836  Sauer  This project upgrades and augments the use of a ten station 
              physics laboratory by allowing students the use of computers  and other
              state-of-the-art equipment.  In these laboratories  students examine the
              physical laws and concepts of physics not  only by experimentation during
              laboratory sessions, but also on  an individual basis from assignments made in
              the classroom or  honors class.  By the use of the computer and computer 
              interfacing with sensors, they are able to more quickly and  more carefully
              analyze data while controlling the variables in  their experiments.  By using
              CD ROM and interactive computer  software, they will be better able to study
              the concepts in  their honors projects or the concepts presented as classroom 
              activities.  The project is structured to help increase the  students'
              analytical abilities, to augment their understanding  of the physical laws of
              nature, and to develop their skill in  using modern scientific apparatus. With
              the integration of the  new equipment in the laboratory the students gain
              experiences  that go well beyond those that they would have received in 
              traditional general and introductory physics laboratory  programs.    ***
