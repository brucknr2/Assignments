Abstract    :
              The project is creating an introductory laboratory environment                 
              in which the student is allowed to focus attention as                          
              completely as possible on physics principles.  This is being                   
              accomplished by eliminating distractions of poorly functioning                 
              equipment, outmoded data collection techniques, and                            
              mathematical tedium.  Modern, up-to-date computers, electronic                 
              data collection via transducers, and software for data analysis                
              are being used in the introductory physics laboratory.  The new                
              environment allows students to identify more easily the                        
              underlying physical principles and explore their consequences                  
              more efficiently and effectively than previously possible.                     
              Many of the experiments emphasize the relevance of physics to                  
              everyday life.  These improvements are improving student                       
              interest in physics as a possible career or as a component of                  
              their education.A secondary goal is the enhancement of the                     
              technological awareness of the introductory students.  It is                   
              desired that students will effectively use modern techniques in                
              more advanced laboratory settings, whether physics or other                    
              areas.  By integrating the data collection process with video-                 
              assisted tutorial presentations and analysis and display of                    
              results, the students are using the power of this more advanced                
              equipment without treating it as a "black box".  It is believed                
              that the result of this project will be physics students with                  
              a better grasp of physical principles, of the technology                       
              necessary to solve them, and will appreciate the role physics                  
              plays in their every day lives.
