Abstract    :
              9350247  Hamer  This research will investigate the genetic and molecular 
              biochemical processes involved in a devastating fungal disease of  rice, called
              rice blast disease.  Teaching and curriculum  development will seek to combine
              instruction in the molecular  genetics of model research organisms together
              with the challenge of  developing an awareness of applied research problems. 
              %%%  This award allows a promising young scientist to develop a research 
              program and train others in an area of import basic and applied  interest.  ***
