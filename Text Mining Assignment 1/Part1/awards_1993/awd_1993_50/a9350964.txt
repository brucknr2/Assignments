Abstract    :
              We are changing the Introductory Physics Laboratory from                       
              "standard fare" to a tutorial course with new experiments that                 
              emphasize the physics concepts and principles of, and are given                
              in synchronism with the concurrent lecture course.  In the                     
              past, the first phase of our change covered mechanics.  New                    
              apparatus was developed at Northeastern which is now used at                   
              many colleges and universities, and available commercially.  We                
              are now in the second phase, the electromagnetic cycle of                      
              experiments.  Lack of suitable, commercially available                         
              apparatus is a known serious problem in this part of the                       
              curriculum.  This is especially true for such important                        
              concepts as Ampere's and Faraday's laws.  New robust yet                       
              transparent experiments are in various stages of design,                       
              prototyping, or student testing.  Support from the NSF is being                
              used to incorporate them fully into our curriculum and make                    
              them available to the physics community.  In addition, some                    
              equipment support is being used to fully satisfy the tutorial                  
              character of the new courses.
