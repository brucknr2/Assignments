Abstract    :
              9350005  Sacks    This is a project to develop new statistical methods to
              analyze  complex surveys in the field of education.  The National Institute 
              for Statistical Science (NISS) proposes to develop new more  effective designs
              for answering basic questions facing education  policy.  A group of researchers
              will examine existing data sets and  undertake research focussed on issues
              related to national  educational performance and its connections to demographic
               characteristics of students.  It will explore general issues in  simultaneous
              and casual interpretation.  ***
