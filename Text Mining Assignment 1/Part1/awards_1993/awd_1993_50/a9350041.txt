Abstract    :
              9350041  Johnson                                    The Colorado Statewide
              Systemic Initiatives, "Pursuing Equity,  Achievement and Knowledge for Students
              in Mathematics and Science  Education" (PEAKS) employs three strategies:  (1)
              linking the  development of high mathematics and science standards with changes
               in curriculum, assessment, instructional models, teacher  preparation, and
              professional development; (2) providing leadership  and sustained support for a
              consistent policy environment at all  levels of school governance; and (3)
              engaging the public as  partners in reforming mathematics and science
              education.  Based in  the State's existing standards-based reform efforts and
              in strong  connections to the State's major science- and mathematics-focused 
              businesses, PEAKS will support local school districts as they first  develop
              curriculum and assessment standards based on those adopted  by the State and
              then prepare and implement a plan for staff  development, uses of technology,
              community involvement, assurance  of educational equity, assessment, policy
              review, documentation of  student achievement, and establishing a professional
              development  school for teacher development.    The program will develop a
              centralized enabling structure for  bottom-up changes, making extensive use of
              existing efforts that  have proven successful in the State.  Local Catalyst
              Partnerships  between schools and institutions of higher education, parents, 
              business and industry, state and federal agencies will develop and  implement a
              standards-based education system that has high  expectations for all students. 
              Regional Collaboratives will  provide technical assistance, professional
              development, and  linkages to national, state, and local resources to the Local
               Catalyst Partnerships.  A State infrastructure of leadership,  policies, and
              mechanisms to support system alignment and local  innovation completes the set
              of networks that will organize the  program.  ***
