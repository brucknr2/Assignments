Abstract    :
              9350268  Garcia  The focus of Dr. Ephrahim Garcia's research, during his tenure
              as a Presidential Faculty Fellow, is on the control of flexible dynamic
              systems. Actuation of electro-mechanical devices is used to control the dynamic
              behavior of systems such as automobiles, robotic manipulators, bridges and
              aircrafts. However, the dynamics of the structure and the actuator are often
              coupled leading to structural instability. Collocated feedback strategies are
              used to avoid instability phenomena. In addition, smart or adaptive structures
              are used for structural control and health monitoring. Smart structures
              technology incorporates an integration of sensors, actuators and structural
              members to insure stability, structural identification and vibration
              suppression. Application of neural networks is included for structural self
              diagnosis and control.   ***   v       s  t
