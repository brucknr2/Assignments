Abstract    :
              The Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA) of                
              1991 mandates a minimum utilization requirement of crumb rubber for            
              all asphalt placed as outlined in the schedule below.                          
                                                                                             
                             1994       5%                                                   
                             1995      10%                                                   
                             1996      15%                                                   
                             1997      20% (and each year thereafter)                        
                                                                                             
              The conclusion of the Strategic Highway Research Program (SHRP) in             
              March 1993 and the legislative requirement for inclusion of scrap              
              tire rubber in asphalt paving applications represent a unique                  
              timely opportunity for immediate utilization of products emanating             
              from SHRP's asphalt research program to assess the likely                      
              performance and economic viability of crumb rubber modified asphalt            
              concrete.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              Accordingly, this research project addresses the use of crumb                  
              modifier in asphalt concrete.  Specifically, Dr. Leahy will carry              
              out a comprehensive laboratory investigation utilizing the SHRP                
              accelerated performance tests to evaluate the potential benefits               
              crumb rubber modification may impart to asphalt concrete in terms              
              of permanent deformation.                                                      
                                                                                             
              Interactive activities at the host institution include:  teaching              
              an undergraduate and a graduate course; participating at monthly               
              research colloquia; serving as research advisor to one                         
              undergraduate and graduate student; hosting a seminar with                     
              presentations from three women, all professional engineers; hosting            
              a seminar for University of Oregon women enrolled in math and                  
              sciences; and coordinating participation of women graduate students            
              in the undergraduate mentoring program.                                        
                                                                                             
              This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to                  
              provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in                    
              engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF and             
              (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and engineering            
              by providing greater visibility for women scientists and engineers             
              employed in industry, government, and academic institutions.  By               
              encouraging the participation of women in science, it is a valuable            
              investment in the Nation's future scientific vitality.
