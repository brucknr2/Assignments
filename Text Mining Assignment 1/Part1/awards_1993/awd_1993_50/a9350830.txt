Abstract    :
              This project is designed to implement a program suitable for                   
              large universities in which the students in the calculus and                   
              applied mathematics courses can carry out the experimentation                  
              part of their course work in a computing laboratory. The                       
              computer is being used as a tool for experimentation in the                    
              context of an actual laboratory. Many members of the faculty                   
              are working to  develop the necessary tools for these courses                  
              and see the tremendous advantage that this brings to the                       
              overall teaching and learning experience. A laboratory manual                  
              consisting of 28 modules has been written and is being class                   
              tested in all sections of vector calculus offered at the                       
              university.
