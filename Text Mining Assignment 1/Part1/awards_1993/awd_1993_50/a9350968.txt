Abstract    :
              9350968  Watkins                              A consortium of four metropolitan
              Birmingham colleges and  universities is using a high field Fourier Transform
              Nuclear  Magnetic Resonance (FT-NMR) spectrometer to significantly  impact and
              modernize its undergraduate chemistry curricula and  laboratory programs and
              enhance the existing cooperative course  offerings and joint undergraduate
              student/faculty research  collaborations.  The hands-on use of a shared
              routine,  multinuclear NMR facility by chemistry undergraduates at  Birmingham
              Southern College, Samford University, the University  of Montevallo, and the
              University of Alabama at Birmingham is  being strengthened by a consortium
              electronic linkage that  permits interactive data processing and retrieval,
              spectral  library searches, and efficient management of the shared FT-NMR 
              facility.  The FT-NMR is having a profound impact on organic,  sophomore and
              senior inorganic, and physical chemistry, and  instrumental analysis courses in
              the consortium.  A special  emphasis is being placed on providing high quality 
              undergraduate research experiences for chemistry majors and  NSF-AMP research
              interns.
