Abstract    :
              Renovation of the Undergraduate Statistics Curriculum                           
                 This project establishes a Statistical Computing and                       
              Dynamic Graphics Laboratory to support the renovation of the                   
              undergraduate statistics curriculum. The laboratory equipment                  
              includes workstations for student use and for classroom                        
              demonstrations, as well as specialized software. The proposed                  
              laboratory would support the introduction of two new courses,                  
              Statistical Computing and Exploratory Data Analysis with                       
              Dynamic Graphics. In addition, the laboratory would make                       
              possible the modernization of a number of upper division course                
              offerings through the incorporation of recently developed                      
              computer-intensive statistical methods. These methods have                     
              significantly changed the practice of statistics, and should be                
              a central part of a contemporary statistics curriculum.
