Abstract    :
              9350860  Long                                 The goals of this project are
              two-fold: (1) to introduce  students to the new field of biomechanics in Animal
              Physiology,  and (2) to expand the participation and sophistication of 
              students in the advanced laboratory in Neurobiology. To this  end, we propose
              to develop a data-acquisition work-station,  featuring a Macintosh VX computer,
              a high-speed analog-to-  digital board, and LabVIEW software. Unlike our
              current system,  this workstation has programming capabilities, high sample 
              rates, multiple channels, and adjustable gains. With six work-  stations,
              students in Animal Physiology can design and perform  experiments on the
              biomechanics of locomotion, feeding in  invertebrates, and the dynamic power
              output of vertebrate  muscle. These new experiments are also made possible by
              the  addition of SVHS video equipment that allows students to record  and
              analyze animal motions. In Neurobiology, we propose to  teach the sophisticated
              technique of brain slice  electrophysiology. Students will measure the
              electrical  interactions of different cells in the mammalian brain using  brain
              slice electrophysiology.  By giving students the opportunity to learn advanced
              techniques  in biomechanics and electrophysiology, we are introducing them  to
              new ways to address questions that have puzzled, and  continue to puzzle,
              physiologists: (1) How do animals move,  feed, and what, if any, limits do
              muscles impose? (2) How do  the cells of the nervous system "learn," respond to
              stress, and  establish and maintain electrical membrane potentials?
