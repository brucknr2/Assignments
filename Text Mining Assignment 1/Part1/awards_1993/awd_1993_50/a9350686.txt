Abstract    :
              Cooper Union's Electrical Engineering Department plans to                      
              develop a twenty-station Undergraduate Embedded Systems                        
              Laboratory to provide readily interconnectable embedded systems                
              components. These include, but are not limited to, electrical                  
              actuators such as motors and motor drives; valves, power relays                
              or solenoids, assorted sensors, signal conditioning and                        
              interface components; and ruggedized, pre-packaged, brick-                     
              sized, fully plug-compatible, real time imbedded processors.                   
              Senior students  design, assemble, and test their own unique                   
              embedded system applications and are  responsible for all                      
              aspects of software and hardware performance. Although                         
              commercial developmental software is provided, alterations,                    
              software patches, and custom routines are invariably required.                 
              The proposed laboratory is in real time hardware design, where                 
              embedded processors and their required software are treated as                 
              just another hardware component, albeit complicated by their                   
              attendant software. The principal goal is to expose each                       
              student to the nonlinearities, time delays, and unexpected                     
              problems of real-life real-time system design. Funds are                       
              requested  for embedded computers and their drivers only; funds                
              for all other components, such as motors or sensors or relays,                 
              are provided by Cooper Union, along with the required matching                 
              funds.
