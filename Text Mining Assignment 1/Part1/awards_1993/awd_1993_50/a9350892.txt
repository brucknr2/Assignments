Abstract    :
              The equipment purchased (thermal cycler, a tissue culture                      
              enclose and a microcentrifuge) supports the use of PCR                         
              technology in a variety of laboratory classes recently                         
              introduced within a newly instituted B.S. degree program in                    
              Molecular Biology and  Biotechnology.   The program provides a                 
              link between the worlds of research and secondary education.                   
              Classes affected include Genetics, Biotechnology I and II and                  
              Immunology.
