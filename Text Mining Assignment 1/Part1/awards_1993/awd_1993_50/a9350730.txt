Abstract    :
              9350730  Choi  The project will acquire a modern, microprocessor-controlled
              oxygen  bomb calorimeter.  The new instrument will be used to incorporate 
              experimental thermochemistry into the undergraduate curriculum for  both
              non-major and chemistry/biochemistry major courses.  A  particularly
              interesting application is the determination of  caloric content of food in the
              laboratory of a freshman seminar in  food chemistry.  Experimental
              determination of resonance energy in  aromatic compounds and strain energy of
              three-membered ring  compounds will be added to a junior-level majors'
              laboratory. The  new calorimeter will allow more comprehensive coverage of 
              thermochemistry in the undergraduate curriculum and significantly  upgrade the
              materials science capability.  ***
