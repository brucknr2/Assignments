Abstract    :
              93-50542  Cohen    The self-study/planning grant of the Dade County Public
              Schools  will build upon the Science, Mathematics, Computer Education and 
              Environmental Task Force Report conducted by key Dade County  stakeholders. 
              The DCPS will assess student access to mathematics  and science programs,
              teacher qualifications, adequacy of  resources, and learning opportunities for
              students. Task force  members will visit schools and review individual school
              improvement  plans. This information will be consolidated with stakeholder data
               to formulate a comprehensive mathematics and science education   reform plan
              that enhances and refines the Task Force Report.   ***
