Abstract    :
              9350743  Viswanathan      The project will purchase an FT Infrared
              spectrophotometer to  develop new directions in the chemistry curriculum. This
              will  include the introduction of microscale laboratory techniques in  the 1)
              organic chemistry, 2) general and introductory  chemistry, and 3) special
              problems and research in chemistry  courses for the freshmen and sophomore
              level students.The  instrument with its built in computer will enable students
              to  build libraries of spectra, identify impurities in the  synthesized
              chemicals, perform baseline corrections, subtract  solvent spectra and carry
              out computer searches in a relatively  short time. This instrument will also be
              used in the faculty  members' research in the areas of organometallic and
              natural  products chemistry.       ***
