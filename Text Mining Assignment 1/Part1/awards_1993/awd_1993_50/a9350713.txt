Abstract    :
              Mathematical Biology Through Computer-aided Instruction                         
                 This project involves a new course in Mathematical Biology                 
              that is designed to teach students to think mathematically and                 
              be able to solve problems within the context of the biological                 
              sciences. A key point in realizing this goal is that                           
              mathematical understanding and problem solving ability are                     
              different from the skills of mathematical computation.                         
              Mathematical Biology also teaches students to formulate the                    
              description of quantitative problems in terms of mathematical                  
              operations. Accordingly, an interactive program is being                       
              implemented by use of the computer program Mathematica running                 
              on a network of workstation computers. The course emphasizes                   
              four important themes. During laboratory sessions data are                     
              simulated on the computer and flow into a computer aided                       
              analysis system. Experiments, the laboratory notebook, the                     
              calculator and worksheets, and final reports are integrated                    
              into one system. Mathematical Biology is taught as a sophomore                 
              course, and is expected to build on  biological principles                     
              learned in general biology and prepare students for the use of                 
              mathematics in upper division biology courses.
