Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Seminars on this topic were held at Cornell University in 1983 and             
              1987, with 118 participants and 55 papers presented in 1983, and               
              367 participants from 26 countries and 177 papers presented in                 
              1987.  This reflects, in part, the growing worldwide interest in               
              research to better understand the problems of student (and teacher)            
              misconceptions, and educational strategies to address the problems,            
              In the six years our last seminar, much new work has been done and             
              interest in the topic by researchers and teachers has increased.               
              The proposed seminar will include some 150-200 papers presented in             
              parallel sessions and four late afternoon plenary sessions dealing             
              with:  (1) definition and understanding of misconceptions (or                  
              alterative conceptions); (2) epistemological issues underlying the             
              remediation of conceptions; (3) metacognitive strategies to                    
              facilitate overcoming misconceptions; and (4) teacher education                
              considerations and teaching strategies to deal with misconceptions.            
              Funding is requested for honoraria, travel, and per diem for four              
              plenary session leaders (who will also prepare summary reports),               
              for hourly clerical and student support, and to partially fund                 
              production of the Proceedings.  We expect the Seminar Proceedings              
              will be available within 60 days (as for previous seminars) in both            
              print and electronic forms.
