Abstract    :
              This updated course emphasizes tissue culture methods, in situ                 
              hybridization and use of antibodies and fluorescent markers for                
              the identification and quantitation of ions, cytoskeletal                      
              components (microtubules, intermediate filaments and                           
              microfilaments) and quantitative methods using computers for                   
              morphometric measurements. In laboratory exercises the students                
              develop computer microanalysis strategies using enzyme markers                 
              to study various tissues (kidney and liver) in normal and drug-                
              treated mice.  The same studies are duplicated in vitro using                  
              isolated kidney tubule cells for comparison.  Each student                     
              writes a report and present it to the class for discussion.                    
              Extensive use of micrographs from the latest research papers                   
              are made with the help of ScanJet IIc and the computer                         
              interface.
