              Delaware Valley College's PREP Initiative is an enrichment program which will
              target average achieving seventh and eighth grade students who have been
              traditionally underrepresented in the areas of mathematics and sciences.  The
              College has collaborated with four Philadelphia School District Middle Schools
              for student and staff recruitment.  Each of the four schools will identify a
              maximum of fifteen students per school.  A four week summer encampment at the
              Delaware Valley College will provide students with the opportunity to engage in
              group and individual educational programming.  The program will run during the
              month of July (students return home on weekends).  Parental participation is an
              essential component of program activities.  The thematic educational focus will
              be on environmental issues.  Through the emphasis on the environment, students
              will learn basic scientific, mathematical and communication skills.  In
              addition, an on going sub theme will be career development/ exposure.  This
              component will be carried out in follow up activities as well.  Follow up
              activities will include mentoring visits to the four schools and evaluative
              activities.
