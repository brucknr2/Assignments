Abstract    :
              This project promotes active real-world student experience in                  
              designing experiments, selection of data acquisition equipment,                
              as well as data collection and analysis.  Specifically, the                    
              project will purchase data acquisition boards (A to D) and                     
              laptop computers.  This portable hardware can then be                          
              interfaced with currently available sensors and other data                     
              acquisition equipment to permit data acquisition in the field.                 
              This extension into field experiments will enhance the                         
              students' learning and provide a much more challenging and                     
              enjoyable experience by allowing experiments which are of                      
              greater sophistication and complexity than those which can be                  
              performed within the current laboratory facility.
