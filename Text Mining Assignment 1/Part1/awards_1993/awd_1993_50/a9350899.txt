Abstract    :
              The project uses a high-quality, large-format CCD camera on the                
              16-inch computer-controlled telescope at Gettysburg College                    
              Observatory. The camera, with an associated image-processing                   
              workstation, is used to introduce exercises and research                       
              projects involving modern astronomical observing and analysis                  
              techniques to our upperclass physics majors. In the junior-                    
              level advanced laboratory course, it allows the replacement of                 
              an existing exercise on aperture photometry using a                            
              photoelectric photometer with an exercise on CCD photometry of                 
              short-period variable stars in clusters. Senior physics                        
              students doing a required senior project, as well as other                     
              majors interested in astronomy, can participate in research                    
              projects such as the measurement of asteroid parallaxes and the                
              photometry of supernovae, and can be trained in the digital                    
              analysis of astronomical images. The asteroid and supernova                    
              projects not only affect our Gettysburg students, but involve                  
              coordination of observations and sharing of data with students                 
              and faculty at other institutions.
