Abstract    :
              9350334  DeSimone    The goals of my teaching and research plan are to introduce
               contemporary concepts of polymer science to our department which  builds on
              nationally recognized, in-house strengths.  Research will  focus on
              environmentally benign monomer and polymer synthesis in  supercritical carbon
              dioxide and the synthesis and characterization  of high performance
              thiophene-based polymers.  ***
