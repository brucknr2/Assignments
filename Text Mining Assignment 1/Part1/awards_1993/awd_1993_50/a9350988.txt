Abstract    :
              This project ties in with a project funded under the                           
              Undergraduate Curriculum and Course Development program                        
              entitled "A Laboratory Approach to Introductory Differential                   
              Geometry." Much of the preliminary work on this project has                    
              already been completed.  This grant is supporting the purchase                 
              of a Sparc workstation and a graphics accelerator board along                  
              with the peripheral devices necessary to bring machines used in                
              the project in line with the machines students will be using in                
              the laboratory. Undergraduates are being involved in the                       
              development of the modules which will be tested at numerous                    
              institutions.
