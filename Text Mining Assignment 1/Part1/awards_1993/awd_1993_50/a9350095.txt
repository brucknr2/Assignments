Abstract    :
              9350095    St. Louis proposes to initiate a self study that focuses on two 
              major objectives: the assessment of quality mathematics and science  programs
              and the development of a comprehensive systemic plan for  improving mathematics
              and science programs. The self study will  guide the organization of specific
              actions which key stakeholders  may take to develop a shared vision of
              mathematics and science  education. A steering committee of stakeholders, along
              with school  partners, will share the responsibility for implementing the
              stages  of the self study. Data gathered will be prioritized and developed 
              into long range and short term goals for systemic change.  ***
