Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                 For several years, many of the intermediate courses for                    
              undergraduate physics majors at Lawrence University have                       
              included components that nurture skills to use sophisticated                   
              computational resources creatively and independently.  In this                 
              project we are take thing the next natural step by adding                      
              computational components to two advanced courses (Mathematical                 
              Methods of Physics and Advanced Electromagnetic Theory),                       
              thereby broadening the spectrum of feasible senior-level                       
              independent studies and introducing tools that become daily                    
              more crucial to the practicing scientist and engineer.                         
              Specifically, we are incorporating numerical treatment of 2D                   
              and 3D problems in wave propagation, fluid dynamics,                           
              elasticity, quantum mechanics, and electromagnetic theory.  To                 
              support this curricular development, we have added two 3D                      
              graphics workstations and a color printer to our existing local                
              area network.  This hardware allows fast, thorough, graphical                  
              examination of large data files resulting from numerical                       
              simulations carried out locally or, more often, remotely via                   
              network access to one of the national supercomputer centers.
