Abstract    :
              9350636  Tang                                 This project addresses
              undergraduate instruction in areas of  control systems and engineering. Control
              system courses are  currently taught in a traditional lecture oriented fashion
              as in  many other universities. Even simple systems can appear abstract  and
              daunting when described only in mathematical terms. The project  changes this
              situation by developing experiments and demonstrations  to help students
              comprehend theoretical concepts and gain  experience. The project involves
              implementation of motor servo and  temperature control equipment in analog
              control systems, digital  control systems, and power system courses. Equipment
              includes a   Complete Modular Servo, and a  Three-Term Temperature Control. 
              Other ancillary equipment such as a 386-type computer, a data  interface board,
              and analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog  converters are also included. This
              equipment is used by the  students for various experiments including time and
              frequency  response analysis, steady-state error analysis, stability analysis, 
              and controller design, and for their semester-long design project,  giving them
              hands-on experience in solving realistic problems, and  thus bridging the gap
              between theoretical studies and the  application of these theories to practical
              systems.
