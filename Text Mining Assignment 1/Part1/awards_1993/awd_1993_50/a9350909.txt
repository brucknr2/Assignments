Abstract    :
              9350909  Elakovich   The project will purchase a Fourier Transform NMR for use
              in  seven courses of increasing level impacting over 300 students  per year in
              addition to those students pursuing undergraduate  research.  The 1H and 13C
              nmr capabilities will be used to  confirm the structure of synthesis products,
              identify unknowns,  correlate empirical calculations with actual chemical
              shifts to  identify unknown compounds, examine the temperature dependence  of
              chemical shifts, explore the effects of pulse width, rate,  and number on the
              collected spectrum, determine thermodynamic  quantities, and study enzyme
              activity. The project will augment  current efforts to encourage minorities and
              women, who make up  a significant portion of the student population as well as
              the  population in the state, to pursue science education.  An  outreach
              program to local high schools will also be introduced.   In addition, students
              and faculty of five area historically  Black colleges will have access to the
              instrument. This project  should have a very positive effect on the number of
              women and  Blacks who choose to study chemistry.  ***
