Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This planning grant will build a regional coalition to                         
              coordinate the mathematics in-service activities of several                    
              large and complicated systems.  Working with local consortia                   
              of business, basic education, and higher education leaders                     
              working to achieve educational reform, the project director                    
              and senior staff will coordinate the mathematics teacher                       
              enhancement activities of these groups.  The objectives                        
              include ascertaining 1) mathematics in-service needs, 2)                       
              equipment and technology needs, 3) the types of in-service                     
              materials needed, 4) the appropriate role of mathematics                       
              specialists, and 5) how to meet the needs of a growing                         
              population traditionally underrepresented in the                               
              mathematical sciences.  Other objectives include summarizing                   
              the findings of relevant literature and research, and                          
              beginning work on a model mathematics curriculum and model                     
              school infrastructure.  The project will culminate with the                    
              submission of a Teacher Enhancement Program proposal.  To                      
              accomplish these objectives the proposers will form a                          
              national and a regional advisory board composed of leaders                     
              from the constituencies served by the grant activities.                        
              During the twelve months of the grant the project director                     
              and four senior staff members will meet weekly.  The                           
              Regional Advisory Board will meet monthly, while the                           
              National Advisory Board will conduct business via the mail                     
              and telephone.  Th grant activities will benefit all schools                   
              served by Intermediate Units                                                   
              model for cooperative efforts to improve mathematics                           
              instruction involving basic and higher education                               
              institutions, business and industry, government, teachers,                     
              and parents.
