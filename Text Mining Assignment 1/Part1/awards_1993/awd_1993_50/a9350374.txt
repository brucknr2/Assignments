Abstract    :
              9350374  Laurent    Dr. Laurent's goal is to develop an interdisciplinary
              research  program to study information processing and circuit design in the 
              brain, and understand fundamental aspects of neural computation.   Dr.
              Laurent's teaching plans are to broaden the scope of  Neurobiology teaching in
              the Caltech Computation and Neural Systems  graduate program, and to create a
              new interdisciplinary course on  Motor Systems.
