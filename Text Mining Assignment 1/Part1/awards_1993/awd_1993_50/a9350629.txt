Abstract    :
                                                                   Since                     
              plastic packaging accounts for approximately 20 per cent in                    
              volume of the solid waste, recycling plastics will play a                      
              significant role in reducing the volume of solid waste to the                  
              landfills of decreasing number and space in the nation.                        
              Students must be educated in the methods to recycle materials                  
              in order to reduce future waste. This project is intended to                   
              improve materials laboratory instruction for major and non-                    
              major undergraduates by presenting a series of typical plastics                
              recycling experiments, including collecting, grinding,                         
              processing, testing and analyzing of recycled plastics. The                    
              requested equipment includes a plastics granulator, an                         
              extruder, an optical microscope and a plastics hardness tester.                
              These instruments and equipment are typical of those used in                   
              the recycling, quality control and property identification of                  
              plastics. The theoretical and practical experience in materials                
              recycling will give students knowledgeable insight in reducing                 
              solid waste, conserving natural resources and protecting the                   
              environment. This project could serve as a model for                           
              undergraduate institutions in the nation for creating an                       
              understanding of the effect and need of recycling materials for                
              the conservation of our environment and natural resources.
