Abstract    :
              9350778  Prusch  The Biology Department at Gonzaga University is attempting to 
              both increase and strengthen the laboratory component of a  newly-revised and
              expanded Cell Biology course and to increase  research opportunities for
              undergraduate majors. The former  upper division one semester Cell and
              Molecular Biology course  has been expanded to two semesters and is now
              directed at  sophomore level biology majors. The laboratory component of  this
              expanded Cell Biology course will introduce students to a  variety of
              techniques used in cell biology as well as reinforce  concepts introduced in
              the lecture portion of the course. One  of the most basic as well as important
              techniques used  routinely in cell biology is fluorescence microscopy. 
              Fluorescence microscopy can be used to follow a wide variety of  events in
              living cells in real time, as well as the  distribution of specific substances
              in fixed cells. For  example, students will be able to study endocytosis in
              living  cells from the initial interaction of a signal with receptors  on the
              cell surface to endosome or phagosome formation.  Cytoskeletal rearrangements
              in response to environmental  stimuli and localized biochemical events in
              living cells will  be studied. Acquisition of fluorescence microscopes will
              give  biology students new experiences in their laboratories and  greatly
              broaden the opportunities for the use of modern  technology in their own
              research projects.  ***
