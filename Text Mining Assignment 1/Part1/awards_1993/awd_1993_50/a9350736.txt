Abstract    :
              Laboratory experiments are being integrated into the                           
              undergraduate math curriculum.  In particular, two courses are                 
              being affected - Applied Computational Mathematics and Fourier                 
              Series and PDEs -  and changes are being made in other                         
              undergraduate courses on mathematical modeling, dynamical                      
              systems, and control. For example, 1) students are able to take                
              experimental data which they have collected themselves and                     
              program and implement the routines to analyze it using discrete                
              Fourier transforms; 2) students who have solved a PDE by                       
              separation of variables can see their solutions evolve in time                 
              and understand better the physical phenomena the equations                     
              describe;  3) students are able to compare separation of                       
              variables solutions of such problems as the Euler-Bernoulli                    
              beam and the vibrating drum head to experimental data.
