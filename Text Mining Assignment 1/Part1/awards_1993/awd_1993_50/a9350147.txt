Abstract    :
              A thorough empirical evaluation of the role that recent banking                
              sector distress has played in the slowdown of the credit and money             
              aggregates will be undertaken.  The research involves examining                
              cross-sectional data at the state and bank level, prior to, during,            
              and after the official quarters of the 1990 recession.                         
                                                                                             
              The results of this study will have important implications for the             
              role of the banking system in the economy, which in turn will have             
              implications for how best to regulate banks without unduly                     
              inhibiting them.  In addition, a better understanding of the role              
              that banking sector problems have played in the sluggish money                 
              growth will help to shed light on the appropriate role of the                  
              aggregates in the monetary policy process.                                     
                                                                                             
              Interactive activities at the host institution include:  teaching              
              one to two masters level classes in monetary economics,                        
              participating in the weekly monetary workshop, having informal                 
              lunch meetings with female graduate students, and conducting                   
              workshops for undergraduate women to encourage them to pursue                  
              careers in economics.                                                          
                                                                                             
              This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to                  
              provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in                    
              engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF and             
              (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and engineering            
              by providing greater visibility for women scientists and engineers             
              employed in industry, government, and academic institutions.  By               
              encouraging the participation of women in science, it is valuable              
              investment in the Nation's future scientific vitality.
