Abstract    :
              A Physics/Physiology Laboratory will be established with                       
              fourteen computerized lab stations for shared use by students                  
              in  undergraduate Physics and Physiology transfer courses. This                
              equipment will facilitate the addition of three new dimensions                 
              to the present science curriculum:l. Physics students will be                  
              provided with real-time acquisition and display of data                        
              gathered from experiments in the areas of motion, heat, sound,                 
              electricity, magnetism and light;2. Physiology students will be                
              provided with hands-on experiences recording basic                             
              electrophysiological phenomena such as EMG, EEG, ECG, nerve                    
              conduction velocities, blood flow rates and respiration rates                  
              and volumes;3. Physics and Physiology students will be provided                
              with interdisciplinary lab experiences through their work on                   
              team assignments.In addition to the pedagogical advantages                     
              offered by hands-on experiences and real-time data acquisition                 
              and display, grouping of physiology and physics students                       
              together into inter-disciplinary teams will increase students'                 
              retention and depth of understanding of concepts by providing                  
              opportunities for cooperative learning as well as increase                     
              students' understanding of the interrelatedness of science.
