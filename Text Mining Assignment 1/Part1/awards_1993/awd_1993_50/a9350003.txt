Abstract    :
              9350003  Rutherford    The American Association for the Advancement of Science 
              (AAAS) is continuing its program of systemic reform in the  teaching and
              learning of science, mathematics and  technology.  Phase I, which started in
              1985 and ended in  1989 with the publication of Science for All Americans 
              (SFAA), described what a scientifically literate person  should know,
              particularly in science.  In addition to  discipline specific content,
              cross-cutting themes and habits  of mind were described.  Phase II is to
              provide an entirely  new set of reform tools for educators to use to redesign 
              curricula and schools to implement SFAA.  Six school-based  sites are to
              develop curriculum models based on inquiry,  explanation, design and issues
              which deliver the science of  SFAA and to develop blocks of curriculum (about
              0.25 of a  year long).  Phase II is also to provide a Framework for  Curriculum
              Design to be used by curriculum designers, school  districts, test developers,
              teacher educators, describes how  to target desired learning outcomes in terms
              of inputs,  constraints, options and costs in a variety of approaches to 
              implementing SFAA.  The fourth part of Phase II is a series  of Blueprints
              which recommend changes that need to be made  in order for the curriculum and
              teaching reforms of Project  2061 to take hold and survive in the school
              setting.  These  Blueprints include topics such as Teacher Education, 
              Assessment, Materials and Technology, Curriculum  Connections, School
              Organization, Parents and Community,  Higher Education, Business and Industry,
              Educational  Research, Equity, Educational Policy, and Finance.  Other  aspects
              of the project are funded by others.  ***
