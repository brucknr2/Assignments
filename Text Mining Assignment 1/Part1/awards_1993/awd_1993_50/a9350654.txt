Abstract    :
              The proposed project will provide studentswith "hands-on"                      
              experience with distributed operating systems in a realistic                   
              environment. The students in the Operating Systems and related                 
              courses will be able to experiment with the hardware and                       
              software aspects of a distributed operating system. This will                  
              lead to a better understanding of the basic concepts e.g. fault                
              tolerance, load balancing, incremental growth, computational                   
              speedup and transparency which are not available in a                          
              traditional centralized operating system environment. To this                  
              end, it is planned to use Minix 1.5 (a UNIX look alike), an                    
              open, unprotected operating system with a networking kernel.                   
              The requested equipment comprises ten 486DX workstations                       
              connected via ethernet, each running the Minix 1.5 networking                  
              kernel. The machines in the existing operating systems                         
              laboratory (obtained through NSF/ILI grant USE: 8851239, with                  
              PC/XTs) will also be connected via ethernet to the new                         
              machines.
