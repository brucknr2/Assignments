Abstract    :
              9350992  Mitchell    Students can be passive in their approach to learning 
              mathematics, and they too frequently are unmotivated to expend  much effort on
              learning this subject because they fail to see  the relevance, importance, and
              power of mathematics. This  project is actively involving students in the
              process of  learning, and giving them a feel of the potential effect of 
              mathematics on their lives. In order to do this, they are  establishing a
              networked computer classroom/laboratory  dedicated to mathematics. This is
              enabling students to learn by  discovery instead of by memorizing facts, to
              concentrate on  concepts instead of the details of arithmetic, to interact with
               one another and the mathematics instead of struggling alone or  withdrawing
              from the situation, and to receive immediate  attention from the instructor-via
              the network eye instead of  only discovering that their work is in error later,
              while doing  their homework or on an exam.  ***
