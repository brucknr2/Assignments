Abstract    :
              The project involves purchase of a voltamograph, differential                  
              scanning calorimeter, and a thermogravimetric analyzer. The                    
              equipment will be used to update theexperiments in five courses                
              ranging from sophomore level tosenior level and will be used by                
              students for their senior projects. Electrochemical methods                    
              will be used to determine thermodynamic parameters such as                     
              equilibrium constants and cell potentials; to quantitatively                   
              determine the presence of trace amounts of heavy metals,                       
              pharmaceutical, and inorganics; to analyze the effect of                       
              ligands on the oxidation/reduction potential of a central metal                
              ion; and to study the kinetics of electrochemical reactions to                 
              elucidate reaction mechanisms. Thermal methods will be used to                 
              study properties of materials including dehydration                            
              characteristics, glass transition temperatures, thermal                        
              stabilities, heat capacities, enthalpy changes, melting points,                
              and solid phase transitions.
