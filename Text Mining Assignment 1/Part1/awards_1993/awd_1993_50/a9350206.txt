Abstract    :
              9350206 Popovic The research concentrates on quasi optical power combining of
              microwave and millimeter wave solid state devices.  This technique allows the
              powers of a large number of individual devices to be combined in a compact, low
              cost, reliable high power source.  Since the power combining occurs in free
              space, radiation and antenna design are addressed.  Both amplifier and
              oscillator combiners are studied, using FETs or bipolar transistors.  A design
              oriented analysis is developed for optimizing the radiating structure geometry
              towards different design criteria, such as power, bandwidth, efficiency or low
              noise.  In the case of oscillators, nonlinear behaviour and injection locking
              of a large number of devices are studied.  In the case of amplifiers, a high
              efficiency circuit topology is combined with the radiating structure in order
              to minimize heat sinking requirements.  The goal of the work is to develop a
              compact, inexpensive microwave solid state source for a variety of
              applications, such as vehicular radar, mobile communications, wireless
              communications, atmospheric studies and remote sensing. ***
