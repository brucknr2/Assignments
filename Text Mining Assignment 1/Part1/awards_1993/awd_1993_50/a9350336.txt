Abstract    :
              This program has two major components: research and teaching in  image
              processing, both having a focus on three-dimensional data.   The research
              component is divided into two major thrusts:  1. the  development of new
              methods for estimating motion in three  dimensions from three-dimensional data
              sets.  The first aim  involves optimizing data acquisition methods given a
              prior  stochastic description of the motion and assuming the use of a  certain
              optical flow method.  The second aim explores the theory of  three-dimensional
              vector tomography and its implementation using a  magnetic resonance scanner. 
              2. The estimation of shape from three-  dimensional data sets.  This topic
              focuses on active surface  methods: the definition of new active surfaces, the
              algorithms and  their convergence properties, and the use of active surface
              methods  for 3-D image registration.    The teaching component of this grant
              has two main objectives: 1. to  develop a state-of-the-art signal and image
              processing laboratory,  and, 2. to develop new courses and textbooks on image 
              reconstruction.  The overall goal is to provide a comprehensive  educational
              program at the cutting edge of signal and image  processing
