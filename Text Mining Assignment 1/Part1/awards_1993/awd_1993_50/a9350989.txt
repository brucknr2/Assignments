Abstract    :
              9350989  Martin      The instructional programs in chemistry and biochemical
              science  are being enhanced by the addition of new experiments made  possible
              by the use of high performance liquid chromatography  (hplc) and liquid
              chromatography-mass spectrography (lc-ms).   One hplc system is being added to
              our present mass spectrometer  for instructional laboratory experiments and
              student research  projects.  A second is being paired with an existing hplc for
               other laboratory experiments and research.  At least nine new  experiments are
              being adopted for chemistry courses throughout  the curriculum.  Most of the
              new experiments are sets of  laboratory exercises centered on a "problem" to be
              solved by a  "research team" of students.  Several of the new experiments  are
              using chiral phase chromatography for analysis of mirror  image isomers formed
              during chemical reactions.  In addition,  student undergraduate research
              opportunities are increasing  with more access to hplc and lc-ms.  ***
