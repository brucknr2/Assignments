Abstract    :
                  A new experiment illustrating synthesis, bonding, and                      
              structure is proposed for the general chemistry laboratory.                    
              This experiment will take advantage of modern instrumental                     
              methods of structural determination to present these concepts                  
              at a level appropriate for freshmen. Students will run a series                
              of microscale reactions on vanillin, involving oxidation and                   
              reduction of the aldehyde, bromination of the aromatic ring,                   
              and esterification of the phenol. Both reactants and products                  
              will be analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and                   
              infrared spectrophotometry. This experiment would serve every                  
              student in the freshman class by affording a more balanced view                
              of chemistry and providing an alternative entry point into the                 
              chemistry major.
