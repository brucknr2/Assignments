Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  We propose to develop and distribute a 40- to -50 page                    
              manual describing the expedition, and providing specific                       
              examples of suitable interdisciplinary activities.  These                      
              activities will be consistent with the trend towards providing                 
              educational experiences which are:

              --interdisciplinary                                                            
              --cooperative                                                                  
              --community-based.                                                             
                                                                                             
                   We will use canoeing as our primary example. However, we                  
              will include general information to enable the teacher to                      
              adapt the approach for other outdoor recreational activities.                  
                                                                                             
                   We will encourage schools and canoe liveries to work                      
              together to improve the quality of local science programs and                  
              to create a generation of students with a greater appreciation                 
              of, and concern for, our waterways.  Our distribution plan                     
              includes approximately 2200 livery owners with additional                      
              information on how to approach the schools with this program.
