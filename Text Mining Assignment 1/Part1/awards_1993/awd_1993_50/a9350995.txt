Abstract    :
              9350995  Baum  The project will enhance the physical chemistry experience of 
              undergraduates by exposing them to state-of-the art techniques  involving
              laser-based spectroscopy and molecular modeling. The  major focus of this
              project will be to show students how experiment  and theory complement one
              another in determining the properties of  molecules.  The requested low-cost
              instrumentation will allow  implementation of a variety of projects including
              laser Raman  spectroscopy, laser induced fluorescence, kinetics of fast
              excited-  state reactions (down to 5 ns) and bimolecular processes, and the 
              study of charge transfer complexes.  In each case, the student will  utilize
              SPARTAN to calculate and visualize the molecular properties  appropriate to the
              experiment such as geometry, bond strength,  vibrational modes, molecular
              orbitals, electron density, excited--  state properties, ionization energies,
              and intermolecular  interactions. These activities will illustrate many of the 
              important concepts and applications of physical chemistry.
