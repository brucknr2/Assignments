Abstract    :
              With the potential for tens of millions of transistors enclosed                
              within a package that grants only limited access to the                        
              internal circuitry, it is a challenge to determine whether a                   
              modern integrated circuit is fully functional. The Computer                    
              Engineering Department at the University of Minnesota, Duluth,                 
              is introducing a VLSI circuit design class in the Fall of 1993,                
              and faces the task of testing the integrated circuits that                     
              students design. This project is adding a Logic Analysis System                
              to an existing data acquisition lab to form a test station for                 
              functionally testing and characterizing digital integrated                     
              circuits. The existing data acquisition equipment, acquired                    
              through a prior NSF-ILI grant in 1988, is serving as the                       
              foundation for the test station, providing control functions                   
              and analog stimulus and measurement capabilities. The new                      
              equipment is adding the capability of exercising the device                    
              under test with a stream of test vectors and capturing its                     
              response at high speed. With NSF's help, this new equipment is                 
              enhancing the function of the existing NSF-supported data                      
              acquisition equipment to form a complete test station for                      
              testing and characterizing students' digital integrated circuit                
              designs. The addition of this equipment is enabling development                
              of a future course on techniques for testing and design for                    
              testability ideas.
