              is broadly representative of the community, educators, business,               
              informal science, and the Ohio Department of Education .  The self-            
              study will begin with a review of current practices including                  
              goals, available equipment and technology, community resources,                
              teacher qualifications, model programs, and others.  New data will             
              be gathered from the broad community through surveys, interviews,              
              and observations.  The data will be carefully analyzed and                     
              recommendations for improvement made by the Steering Committee.                
              Public fora will be held in the city to share the data and                     
              recommendations and to gather comments on them to be included in a             
              final set of recommendations and a plan for improvement of science             
              and mathematics education based upon the data and recommendations.
