Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This is a coordinated team research project to be conducted in            
              ten large American cities to analyze the circumstances and dynamics            
              by which cities organize efforts to achieve significant educational            
              reform and further related human capital development opportunities.            
              The primary goals are to analyze the origins, progress, and extent             
              of education reform efforts; to map out the coalitions and                     
              political interactions and structures that form the context for                
              effective or ineffective policymaking; to determine empirically the            
              success of different types of civic arrangements in initiating and             
              sustaining education reform; and to provide information about the              
              factors that activate sociopolitical support for education and                 
              related programs.  The concept of "civic capacity" as a dynamic                
              win/win construct for all important civic actors is the central                
              theoretical notion.  The cities to be studied are: Atlanta,                    
              Baltimore, Denver, Detroit, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami,                       
              Philadelphia, San Francisco, and Washington.  The research teams               
              will use a common set of instruments and procedures and analyze the            
              results using a common framework.  Fieldwork, analysis, and initial            
              reporting will take approximately two and a half years.  The                   
              project should not only illuminate the process of systemic reform,             
              but should provide independent information useful in interpreting              
              the progress and results of NSF's Urban Systemic Initiative.
