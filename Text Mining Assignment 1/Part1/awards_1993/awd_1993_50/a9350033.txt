Abstract    :
              9350033  Sobol      New York's Statewide Systemic Initiative will develop an
              Urban  Networks project to implement the state's comprehensive, systemic 
              reform effort, the New Compact for Learning, by beginning  implementation in
              the state's six largest urban school districts  (New York, Buffalo, Albany,
              Syracuse, Rochester, and Yonkers).  The Compact was adopted by the Board of
              Regents in March 1991 and  specifies high expectations, standards, and outcomes
               for grades  K-12.  The Compact is an open-ended plan for continuing school 
              district reassessment and innovation.      A common RFP will be developed and
              schools in each of the six  districts will be selected as Research and
              Development (R and D)  schools to provide high-level content and assessment for
              all  students, and long-term teacher development programs.  Districts  will
              establish local partnerships with the mathematics/science  communities,
              parents, and business and industry in support of the  initiative.  The State
              will provide additional resources to  support the effort through State
              field-based assistance teams,  staff development, a new school accreditation
              program that  focuses on teaching and learning, and coordination with existing 
              programs aimed at at-risk students.  Results and strategies from  the R and D
              schools will inform future State policy action.   ***
