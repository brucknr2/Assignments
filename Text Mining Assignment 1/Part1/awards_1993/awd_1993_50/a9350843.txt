Abstract    :
              The project will develop the use of interactive graphics and                   
              molecular modeling software as the equivalent of a laboratory for              
              teaching structural principles in chemistry and biochemistry.                  
              Students will do modeling, energy calculations and conformational              
              analysis of small molecules, as well as analysis and manipulation              
              of protein structures.  Use of the equipment will be extended to               
              the organic and introductory courses. Student/faculty research is              
              an important part of the curriculum and the workstations and                   
              software will be utilized in all areas of chemistry represented in             
              the department. Introducing students to the uses of these systems              
              early in their scientific careers will allow them more                         
              independence, permitting them to discover for themselves how                   
              chemical properties are related to molecular structure.
