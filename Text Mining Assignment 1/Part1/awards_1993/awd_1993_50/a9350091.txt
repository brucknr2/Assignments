Abstract    :
              9350091  Douglas    The Indianapolis Public Schools (IPS) is planning to conduct
              an  indepth assessment of its K-12 Mathematics and science programs and  to
              develop plans for implementing changes based on the outcome of  the study.  The
              District will established a Self-Study Steering  Committee and seven Action
              Committees to assist the Project  Director in the study.  The Steering
              Committee will include members  with math, science, and/or technology
              backgrounds representing the  School Board, teacher's association,
              universities, and local  cultural institutions.  The Action Committee members
              will come from  the mathematics and science communities at Purdue University, 
              Indiana University, Ball State University, and other area  universities.  They
              will assist in the collection and analysis of  data and in developing
              recommendations.    The Self-Study will use the NCTM Standards, AAAS's Science
              for All  Americans, and the benchmark from Project 2061 as criteria and  points
              of reference to determine the status and direction of the  mathematics and
              science programs.  The Project Director will  coordinate the work of the
              Steering Committee and Action  Committees.  The study process will have three
              phases:  the self-  evaluation phase, the visiting committee phase (1 year),
              and the  follow-up phase for implementation (5 years).  It will follow the 
              principles of the National Study of School Evaluation and adapt it  approach to
              data collection.  ***
