Abstract    :
              9350370  Zhu  This Presidential Faculty Fellow  Award will allow the PI to
              develop a  research program in cellular  engineering focusing on cell  adhesion
              and cell locomotion.  In  addition, the award will enable the  PI to enhance
              his teaching by  applying case-based learning to his  courses, developing a
              curriculum in  cellular transport and tissue  engineering and participating in 
              undergraduate teaching.  ***
