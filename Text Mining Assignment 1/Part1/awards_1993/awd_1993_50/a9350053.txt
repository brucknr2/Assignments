Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The AAAS Project on Science, Technology and                                    
              Disability is conducting a project to prepare,                                 
              produce and disseminate a third edition of the                                 
              Resource Directory of Scientists and Engineers with                            
              Disabilities.  The current Directory, published in                             
              1987, is outdated and lacks data on many                                       
              outstanding scientists and engineers with disabilities                         
              whom AAAS has identified since the publication of                              
              the last edition.  A number of individuals listed in                           
              the 2nd edition have new degrees or positions, and                             
              some are deceased.  A new edition is needed so that                            
              students with disabilities, teachers, administrators,                          
              counselors, families, program officers and                                     
              employers can network with working scientists and                              
              engineers with disabilities who can provide                                    
              knowledge and experience in eliminating barriers                               
              and successfully managing their education and entry                            
              into a science or engineering career.                                          
                                                                                             
              The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990                                    
              requires public facilities and programs to be made                             
              accessible to people with disabilities.  The                                   
              individuals who will be listed in the Resource                                 
              Directory are familiar with this law and, even                                 
              before its inception, were designing adaptations and                           
              providing technical assistance on accessibility                                
              issues.  They will be available through the                                    
              Directory to assist others in restructuring their                              
              science and engineering environments.                                          
                                                                                             
              The products of this project will be three:  a print                           
              edition of the Resource Directory, an alternative                              
              format (disk) edition of the Resource Directory for                            
              people who are blind or print-impaired, and lists of                           
              scientists and engineers with disabilities in specific                         
              science disciplines on disk for use by NSF program                             
              officers in selecting peer reviewers and committee                             
              members.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              The revised edition will be cross-referenced by                                
              scientific specialty, disability, location and gender                          
              and will list approximately 1,200 individuals.
