Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Baltimore proposes to plan for a larger scale initiative to                    
              address science and mathematics education for low-income,                      
              and underrepresented groups.  This is a collaborative                          
              between Morgan State University, the university designated                     
              by the state to coordinate efforts on urban education, and                     
              the Baltimore City Public Schools (BCPS).  The goals of the                    
              proposal are to:  1) strengthen and expand existing                            
              collaborations to include ALL major players in mathematics                     
              and science education;  2) complete a comprehensive self-                      
              study;  and 3) develop a comprehensive design for the                          
              Baltimore City Initiative.                                                     
                                                                                             
              The award period is for 12 months, starting January 15,                        
              1993.
