Abstract    :
              A novel experiment using three-phase dehydroclorination                        
              reactions will be used as an example of wastewater treatment.                  
              The experiment will be incorporated into a senior chemical                     
              engineering laboratory. In this experiment trichloroethylene                   
              and hydrogen which are dissolved in the aqueous solution adsorb                
              and react on the palladium on carbon catalyst. The reaction                    
              products are ethane and HCl resulting in the detoxification of                 
              wastewater. The palladium on carbon catalyst is either slurried                
              in solution (batch autoclave reactor) or fixed in a tubular                    
              reactor bed (trickle-bed) configuration . The equipment request                
              is for the reactors and analytical systems to determine                        
              trichloroethylene and chloride ion concentrations in aqueous                   
              solutions.
