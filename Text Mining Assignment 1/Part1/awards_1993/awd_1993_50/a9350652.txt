Abstract    :
              9350652  Brletic     The project will purchase a Fourier transform infrared 
              spectrophotometer (FT-IR), spectral libraries, temperature-  controlled IR
              cells and various reflectance accessories to be  used in five upper-level
              chemistry courses (Instrumental  Analysis, Physical, Polymer, Advanced Organic,
              and Advanced  Inorganic Chemistry) along with Independent Study Projects.   The
              FT-IR and accessories will provide students with tools for  the cutting edge
              studies in vibrational analysis.  The  underlying theory of infrared (IR)
              analysis will be introduced  at the freshman chemistry level and "hands-on"
              experience  provided at the second year level.  This project will allow  for:
              improved experiments dealing with qualitative and  quantitative analysis; new
              projects dealing with the  application of normal coordinate calculations and
              partition  functions to gas-phase spectra; and new experiments involving 
              samples (aqueous solutions, polymers, emulsions and coatings)  studied by
              reflectance.  ***
