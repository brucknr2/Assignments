Abstract    :
              9350559  Durig    This project conducts a four-week residential camp for
              forty-four Black eighth- and ninth grade  students from rural areas.  The camp
              is held on the Columbia campus and on Pritchard's Island.   The project focuses
              on instruction in life-, earth-space, and physical sciences and includes 
              mentoring by faculty and graduate students as well as academic-year follow-up. 
              It is consistent  with statewide efforts to restructure science and mathematics
              education at the K-12 levels and  is located in the same region as the
              undergraduate level Alliance for Minority Participation   (AMP) at the
              University of South Carolina.
