Abstract    :
              9350093  Elwood    The Milwaukee Public Schools seeks funding for a self 
              study\planning grant for the development of:         1. a policy making
              structure that stimulates stakeholder       collaboration;        2. a
              community mindset that recognizes the importance of       mathematics and
              science;        3. a set of mathematics and science standards;        4. a
              systemic process to review and assess program success.    The Commission 2000
              will establish the bounds of the study,   establish a structure for continued
              guidance and monitoring of  mathematics and science education reforms and
              review the products  generated by the self study. A Working Group comprised of
              Milwaukee  constituencies will conduct the work of the self study. A Project 
              Steering Committee will facilitate the work of the Steering  Committee and
              provide direction and feedback during the self study.   Upon completion of the
              study, a final document will be developed  that will include a "State of the
              District" report and  recommendations for improvement.     ***
