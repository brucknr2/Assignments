Abstract    :
              At the number of jobs in which shared rather than individual                   
              work continues to grow, the way people work must be re-                        
              examined. This proposal suggests that in today's workplace,                    
              computer scientists must be adept at both technical as well as                 
              communication skills. Educators must prepare students to work                  
              in the collaborative environments found in today's industry.                   
              The individual programmer is rapidly becoming extinct. This                    
              proposal is to adapt an existing computer-supported cooperative                
              problem solving environment and use it in software development                 
              courses. By doing this, the problem solving skills of students                 
              will be expanded and thus release into the computer science                    
              community graduates who are more effective programmers. The                    
              environment will encourage cooperative work and yet provide                    
              instructors with some ability to monitor individual as well as                 
              group performance. This proposal is to network the requested                   
              machines, configure them with the cooperative problem solving                  
              environment, and dedicate them to this project. With a student                 
              machine ratio of 3.5, students will be able to learn software                  
              engineering techniques and, at the same time, gain valuable                    
              experience in working together on large team projects.
