Abstract    :
              This advanced laboratory for microbiology majors features  the                 
              integrates the technology of modern cell and molecular biology                 
              into existing laboratory exercises so that students select for                 
              molecular study an organism they have isolated from nature.                    
              They utilize molecular probes to confirm the identities of                     
              their isolates by fluorescence microscopy. They then purify DNA                
              from their isolates, and apply both polymerase chain reaction                  
              (PCR) gene amplification and Southern blot analyses to the DNA.                
              This integrated approach enables students to understand                        
              isolated techniques in a wider context.
