Abstract    :
              9350473  Novak    With the goal of developing an innovative polymer science
              program,  Dr. Novak's research is focused on the development of new living 
              polymerizations, new types of organic-inorganic hybrid materials,  photoactive
              polymers, and aqueous-based polymerization chemistry.   His teaching plan is to
              establish a polymeric materials program at  both the undergraduate and graduate
              levels.  ***
