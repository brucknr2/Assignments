Abstract    :
                      The college will purchase a 200 MHz FT-NMR spectrometer                
              to enhance the student laboratory experience.  It will                         
              introduce 13C NMR, variable temperature, and time-resolved                     
              studies into the laboratory program. The spectrometer will be                  
              integrated into the curriculum so that every student experience                
              builds upon knowledge and expertise already gained. NMR                        
              spectroscopy will be introduced in the sophomore year and                      
              integrated into the upper division curriculum.  In each course,                
              the students will independently operate the instrument, using                  
              it not only for identification and structural characterization                 
              of compounds but also to obtain chemical parameters such as                    
              equilibrium and rate constants, diffusion coefficients, etc. It                
              will also provide valuable hands-on experience with a computer-                
              controlled data acquisition system. An advanced theory course                  
              including work with the spectrometer, and independent research                 
              projects involving FT-NMR, will be offered. The Physics                        
              department will incorporate the spectrometer into their modern                 
              physics laboratory course.
