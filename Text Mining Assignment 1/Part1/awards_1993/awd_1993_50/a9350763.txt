Abstract    :
              At a time when scientific breakthroughs often rely on                          
              interdisciplinary crossfertilization a team of scientists and                  
              musicians will introduce our students to the advantages of                     
              approaches that cross disciplines and departmental lines. It is                
              in this spirit that we propose the development of a                            
              bioacoustics laboratory and a bioacoustics course.                             
              The bioacoustics laboratory will be a multiuser facility based                 
              on a Kay DSP SonaGraph 5000, a Racal Store 4DS instrumentation                 
              recorder, and five Macintosh workstations with Macrecorder                     
              software. The bioacoustic laboratory will be made available to                 
              students taking courses in animal behavior, ecology, behavioral                
              ecology, avian biology, insect biology, general physics,                       
              orchestration and a new interdisciplinary course entitled                      
              bioacoustics.                                                                  
              Bioacoustics will combine the teaching effort of a physicist,                  
              a biologist, and a musician. The course is designed to use the                 
              intrinsic appeal of music and the sounds of nature to lure                     
              students into a serious and quantitative study of sound and                    
              communication theory.
