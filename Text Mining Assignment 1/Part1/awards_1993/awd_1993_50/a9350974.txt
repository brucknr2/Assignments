Abstract    :
              The purpose of this proposal is to acquire new equipment for                   
              the analysis of genes and proteins, thereby modernizing and                    
              revitalizing the Genetics course in the Biology Department at                  
              Ursinus College. In addition, the equipment will allow the                     
              inclusion of more challenging experiments in the Evolution                     
              course, and the expansion of opportunities for student                         
              research.We will revise and update the laboratory component of                 
              the Genetics course by teaching the indispensable, fundamental                 
              principles of Genetics, supplemented by auxiliary lessons which                
              deal with the history of genetics, knowledge of sexual and                     
              asexual organisms needed for genetics research, and the                        
              acquisition of technical and experimental design skills                        
              necessary for careers in science. Such skills will encourage                   
              and better prepare students for an independent undergraduate                   
              research experience, an opportunity which the Biology                          
              Department desires to provide to all majors.The equipment                      
              requested will permit us to teach several new principles in our                
              Genetics and Evolution courses, enhance the student research                   
              program, and better serve the unprecedented numbers of Biology                 
              majors we have had the good fortune to attract to Ursinus
