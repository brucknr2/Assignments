Abstract    :
               Mathematics at Illinois Wesleyan is shifting from precalculus                 
              to calculus level courses. Last year, over 78% of the freshmen                 
              were advised to begin their mathematics in one of the calculus                 
              courses. In an attempt to make the calculus experience more                    
              meaningful to the general student population, they are offering                
              several avenues through the freshman calculus experience. After                
              a positive experiment involving software under development at                  
              the University of Illinois through the "Calculus and                           
              Mathematica" project, the Department added a three course                      
              sequence, Calculus/Mathematica, to its offerings in the spring                 
              of 1992. The department is modifying and adapting the                          
              University of Illinois software to accommodate the different                   
              audience and the course goals of this institution. Because in                  
              this new approach to the teaching and learning of calculus, the                
              keyboard and screen is replacing pen and paper, they are now                   
              holding all class meetings in the lab, where lectures,                         
              homework, and tests are being done with the aide of the                        
              computer.  The new computers are allowing the mathematics                      
              department to continue to reduce the amount of time that the                   
              instructor spends lecturing instead of guiding the students to                 
              develop the necessary insight needed to master the material.
