Abstract    :
              9350346  Dasgupta  This PI intends to continue his work in the area of robust
              stability.  Robust stability mainly concerns the design of controllers which
              are guaranteed not to go unstable, so long as the plant to be controlled is
              linear and its parameter are known to lie within some fixed but wide interval. 
              Many theorems have already been proven demonstrating stability for parameter
              sets within certain kinds of interval; the PI will attempt to develop
              techniques to help evaluate known intervals of uncertainty, to help determine
              whether they actually meet the required criteria.  In addition, he intends to
              investigate whether Lyapunov stability theory can be applied to systems with
              parametric uncertainty particular types of nonlinear feedback.  The PI also
              intends to perform theoretical analysis of signed adaptive filters for signal
              processing, and of the properties of Hopfield networks.  He intends to explore
              robust stability theory as an alternative to learning or adaptive methods in
              channel equalization.  He also plans to apply discrete event models to the
              modeling of cell growth.  ***   v       s  t  tability mainly concerns the d
