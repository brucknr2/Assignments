Abstract    :
              9350467  Fabien  This is a Presidential Faculty Fellow (PFF) award. The 
              activities under this award include development of  innovative courses in the
              areas of  kinematics and dynamics  of machines, dynamic system analysis and
              automatic  controls. In addition, laboratory development and research  projects
               are pursued related to analysis and synthesis of  mechanisms, vibration
              control of nonlinear flexible  structures, and design of electromechanical
              systems.  Specific contributions include significant and novel  contributions
              to the field of mechanical engineering,  specifically dealing  with the
              application of modern control  theory for electromagnetic leirtation devices,
              and the  formulation of linear and nonlinear control strategies for  the
              analysis and design of high-speed mechanisms.  ***
