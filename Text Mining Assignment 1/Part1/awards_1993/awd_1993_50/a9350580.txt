Abstract    :
              SSC-9350580   The Science Place  Dallas, TX    Sudduth, William, Mooz, Elizabeth
              and Hafey, Charles    "Summer Science Camp"    Since science and math skills
              need to be strengthened among  minority teens, The Science Place (TSP) Summer
              Science Camp (SSC)  is designed to provide a six-week program to this target
              group  emphasizing scientific and computer instruction, exposure to  scientific
              research, career exploration, communication skills,  family involvement, and
              student contact with scientists and  engineers.  The program is a collaborative
              effort involving TSP  staff, Dallas ISD students, the YMCA of Metropolitan
              Dallas, and  the D.C. James Learning Center.  Students will be selected on the 
              basis of questionnaires, interviews, and recommendations.   Six  scientific
              modules will be introduced depicting: physics, the  environment, electricity,
              astronomy, health and biology, and math.   Other areas to be included are: 
              visiting scientists, career  opportunities,and physical education.  During the
              SSC, student  teams will select one area of special interest, write a report
              and  give an oral talk at a family camp-in at TSP.  Students will be 
              encouraged to continue contact with TSP throughout the year with a 
              complementary TSP membership.  Students will be tracked for their  progress by
              DISD teachers, encouraged to educate their peers and  maintain their interest
              in science by volunteering at TSP.
