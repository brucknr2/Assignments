Abstract    :
              The institution is firmly committed to significantly enhance                   
              instruction in the plant sciences. A major goal is to develop                  
              a program in plant physiology, with a special emphasis on                      
              environmental plant physiology or ecophysiology. Key items of                  
              equipment are being used to teach concepts and experimental                    
              methods in microclimatology, radiation interception and leaf                   
              energy balance, water relations, photosynthesis, growth                        
              performance, and efficient data acquisition and analysis. The                  
              equipment is also being used for several exercises in the                      
              Ecology and General Biology courses. It is expected that our                   
              enhanced program will prepare majors for successful graduate                   
              work and productive careers in plant physiology, and that our                  
              approach can serve as a model for such programs in other                       
              institutions.
