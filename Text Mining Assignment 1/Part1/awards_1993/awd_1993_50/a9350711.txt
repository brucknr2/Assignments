Abstract    :
              9350711  Smith       This project proposes to update and enhance the anatomy and
               physiology laboratory experiences of introductory-level biology  students. We
              will accomplish this objective primarily with an  infusion of
              computer-interfaced equipment that will foster an  interactive approach to
              physiology. The two courses targeted  for this new equipment are Human Anatomy
              and Physiology (year  sequence; Biology 111-112) and introductory biology for
              non-  majors (Biology and Society: Biology 103). Both these courses  serve to
              satisfy Core Curriculum requirements. Both courses  deal, at least in part,
              with human anatomy and physiology; both  courses enroll future teachers. These
              courses serve about 400  students each year.Our students will be able to
              collect  physiological data on themselves, display the data and analyze  it.
              They will be able to make microscopic observations, conduct  experiments at the
              microscopic level (permeability of RBC's,  digestion in food vacuoles) and
              display the results for the  entire class. The videodisc capability will make
              available  thousands of images of human cells, tissues, organs and  pathologies
              to our students. The computer-laserdisc link will  be used interactively with
              students. This equipment will be the  nucleus around which we will build a
              course to train our  graduate teaching assistants, part of the next generation
              of  secondary and university teachers.  ***
