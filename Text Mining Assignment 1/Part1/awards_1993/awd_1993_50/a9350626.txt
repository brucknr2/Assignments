Abstract    :
              The program begins with a series of four molecular-based                       
              laboratories in General Biology. In these labs students acquire                
              hands-on experience in three areas of molecular biology: They                  
              learn about genome organization by isolating and examining                     
              onion DNA, they manipulate the genome with restriction                         
              endonucleases, and they are introduced to genes and gene                       
              products by culturing sensitive and antibiotic resistant                       
              bacterial strains.  In a variety of upper division courses                     
              progressively more advanced concepts of molecular biology are                  
              presented with the use of increasingly sophisticated                           
              techniques.
