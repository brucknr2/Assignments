Abstract    :
              Dr. Nelson will carry out research in particle theory.  The time               
              period that she will be at University of California-Santa Barbara              
              coincides with the workshop "Weak Interactions" which will take                
              place at the Institute for Theoretical Physics at Santa Barbara.               
              This subject overlaps with her research interests and she will                 
              collaborate with several of the people attending the workshop.  Dr.            
              Nelson's research will focus on several aspects of the general area            
              of electroweak symmetry breaking:  electroweak baryogenesis, and               
              dynamical supersymmetry breaking in the visible sector.                        
                                                                                             
              Interactive activities at the host institution include:  presenting            
              a participatory seminar course for UCSB upper division physics                 
              majors on theoretical physics in order to encourage talented                   
              undergraduates to continue their involvement in physics, attending             
              and giving research seminars and collaborating with the faculty,               
              postdocs, and graduate students.                                               
                                                                                             
              This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to                  
              provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in                    
              engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF and             
              (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and engineering            
              by providing greater visibility for women scientists and engineers             
              (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and engineers              
              employed in industry, government, and academic institutions.  By               
              encouraging the participation of women in science, it is a valuable            
              investment in the Nation's future scientific vitality.
