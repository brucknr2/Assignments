Abstract    :
              9350983  Etheridge  The project will use computer simulation to provide students
               with experience with IR, NMR, and mass spectrum analysis.  This  will be
              particularly advantageous for this community college  environment where the
              costs of sophisticated instrumentation is  prohibitive.  Using interactive
              multimedia computers, the  investigators will develop videodiscs containing
              both full  motion video and still images as well as interactive courseware  to
              teach proper sampling and instrumentation techniques.  Properly designed
              interactive multimedia is a proven  instructional method that works in teaching
              sampling and  instrumentation techniques.  ***
