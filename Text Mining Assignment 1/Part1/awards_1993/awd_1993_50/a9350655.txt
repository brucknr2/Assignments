Abstract    :
              The purpose of this project is to establish a real life fully                  
              automated robotic cell around the currently available CNC                      
              machines and the other equipment purchased under the previous                  
              ILI grant. The completed cell will consist of three robots                     
              (largest one to be purchased), two CNC machines (mill and                      
              lathe, both available), a conveyor, a storage facility, and a                  
              programmable logic controller. Available simulation package                    
              will be incorporated into the cell as a production control                     
              prediction device and also to animate the machining activity.                  
              A total of four personal computers (two to be purchased) will                  
              be used in operation of various items and input/output                         
              communications among the items and the logic controller.
