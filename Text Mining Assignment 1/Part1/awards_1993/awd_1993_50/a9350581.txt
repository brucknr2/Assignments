Abstract    :
              SSC-9350581  University of California-Berkeley  Berkeley, CA    Morrison, Frank
              H.    "Summer Science Camp-MESA Project Summary"    This proposal is for a
              summer Science Camp grant to help support and academic year  mathematics,
              Engineering, Science, Achievement (MESA) Program at the University of 
              California, Berkeley.  The SSC grant would be specifically used for
              instructional support for 60  Bay Area 7th, 8th and 9th graders in the SSC-MESA
              Project and as part of the MESA Saturday  Academy.    Program participants will
              reflrct the rich cultural and ethnic diversity of the Bay Area which  includes
              African Americans, Chicano/Latinos, American Indians, and Puerto Ricans.    The
              primary objectives of the proposed SSC-MESA Project are to introduce students
              to  engineering and science concepts, demonstrate how academic course work
              relates to their future,  how science and engineering relate to the world
              around them, to become informed and actively  involved in the education of
              their children.    The summer program will be held for 6 weeks June 21-July 31,
              1993, June 20 -July 31, 1994  and June 19-July 30, 1995.  To meet its
              objectives, the SSC-MESA Project includes  morning mathematics and
              communication courses, afternoon engineering and science projects  a
              "shadowing" program, where students will meet with mentor scientists and
              engineers.  The  academic-year program includes; 1) a Fall-1993 and Spring-1994
              Saturday Academy (9 sessions  each semester); 2) after-school math and science
              workshops for students who attend MESA  schools and 3) evening and Saturday
              meetings that provide parents and students with information  on college
              entrance requirements, financial aid, the transition from middle school to
              secondary  school, and career options in science and engineering.
