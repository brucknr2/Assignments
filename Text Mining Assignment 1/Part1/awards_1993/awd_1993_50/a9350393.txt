Abstract    :
              9350393  Brisbois   The focus of this research will be the preparation of  m.n 
              orthoparacyclophanes using a  combination of cycloaddition and organometallic
              approaches.  The target systems will be  4.4 ,   3.3  and the highly strained 
              2.2  orthoparacyclophanes. The training of undergraduate students  through a
              combination of research experience and development of new and exciting learning
               opportunities involving outreach will be stressed.  %%%  Dr. Ronald Brisbois
              is being funded by the Organic Synthesis Program as a Presidential Faculty 
              Fellow.  He will focus his research efforts on the synthesis of cyclophanes. 
              These theoretically  interesting and chemically useful molecules are used for
              the investigation of host-guest  interactions and used to probe alterations in
              the normal bonding found in hydrocarbon systems.   Professor Brisbois will
              stress the training of undergraduate students in his research program.  ***
