Abstract    :
              The purpose of this proposal is to obtain an x-ray set complete                
              with Laue camera and a Straumanis camera for the Debye-Scherrer                
              powder method. The x-ray set will be used in the undergraduate                 
              Materials Laboratory at the Thayer School of Engineering. This                 
              laboratory is utilized primarily for an undergraduate course in                
              Materials Science, which is a required course for both the A.B.                
              and B.E. degrees in Engineering Science. The Materials Science                 
              course is offered twice per year.                                              
              The acquisition of an x-ray set, with radiation enclosure, will                
              provide the students with a hands-on experience for performing                 
              measurements which are some of the most accurate in Materials                  
              Science. Whilst an x-ray set may not be considered to be a                     
              state-of-the-art piece of equipment, the undergraduate projects                
              for which it will be used are. These include: high temperature                 
              superconductivity; optical properties of point defects phase                   
              diagram determination; mechanical properties of polymers;                      
              production and properties of metallic glasses; recovery,                       
              recrystallization and grain growth; processing and properties                  
              of nanocrystalline metals; and thin film processing of                         
              materials. The equipment chosen is a "no frills" set-up that                   
              can be used for orientation determination, phase                               
              identification, crystallization studies, and grain or subgrain                 
              size determination.
