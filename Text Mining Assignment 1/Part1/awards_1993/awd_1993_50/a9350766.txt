Abstract    :
              9350766  Buttles          This project will furnish previously-impossible
              laboratory  experiences to undergraduates in biology pursuing careers in 
              teaching, health, research, and industry. The emphasis is on  learning through
              student access to instrumentation rather than by  observation of
              teacher-executed demonstrations. With the  acquisition of modern equipment for
              biotechnology, students will be  able to culture living cells, isolate cellular
              organelles and  biomolecules, perform intricate analysis of these, and 
              investigate  the behavior of cellular components in normal and abnormal states.
               Phase-contrast microscopes will permit study of structure and  function in
              intact, living cells. In all instances the experiments  will foster basic
              inquiry skills associated with the scientific  endeavor and will be models of
              science as it is practiced in the  technological arena. The results will be to
              provide future teachers  with appreciation and understanding of the
              interdependence of  science and technology and to train the all students in
              skills  vital to achievement of their career goals.
