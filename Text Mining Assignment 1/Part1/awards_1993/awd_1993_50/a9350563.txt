Abstract    :
              SSC-9350563  Detroit Area Pre-College Engineering (DAPCEP)  Detroit, Michigan 
              Hill, Kenneth, Arthur Haman, and Mark Thomas    The Detroit Area Pre-College
              Engineering Program (DAPCEP) and the University of Detroit  Mercy conduct a
              five-week commuter summer camp for fifty seventh- through ninth-grade 
              African-American and Hispanic students annually.  The camp focuses on the
              design and building  of a full-size vehicle made of paper products.  The
              curriculum is based on the Paper Vehicle  Project written by engineers at
              General Motors.  Students learn engineering concepts and take  field trips to
              an automobile assembly plant and proving ground.  The project includes
              mentoring  by professionals in industry and area high schools as well as
              parental involvement.
