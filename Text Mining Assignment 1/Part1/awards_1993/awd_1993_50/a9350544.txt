Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Society of Automotive Engineers is planning the                            
              feasibility for the development of three intensive units for                   
              grades six through eight about which the entire curriculum                     
              could be integrated for a few weeks.  The units would take                     
              the form of automotive engineering design experiences:                         
              exploring automotive systems, flight technology and ground                     
              transportation.  The materials would be targeted to specific                   
              grade levels and engage multiple community resources in                        
              dynamic ways.  The planning period is to form collaborations                   
              with the other major national curriculum groups, and                           
              educational researchers and middle school personnel and to                     
              develop the prototype of the technological challenges which                    
              form the core of the integrated learning experience.  Based                    
              on their experience with The World in Motion, the project                      
              will reach about 10% of the student body nationally through                    
              interactions with engineers in corporations and                                
              universities.  The goals of the project also include the                       
              long term collaboration of businesses, professional                            
              societies and universities, the involvement of individual                      
              engineers with the education of middle school students, and                    
              the encouragement of a greater diversity of students to                        
              consider engineering as a career.  The planning period is to                   
              establish a program development office, to hold a planning                     
              conference to establish the collaborations, to develop and                     
              obtain reaction to a prototype and to prepare a proposal for                   
              developing the curriculum units.
