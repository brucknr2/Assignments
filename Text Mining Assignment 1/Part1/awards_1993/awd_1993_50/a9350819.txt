Abstract    :
              9350819 O'Connor                                                                
                                                                This project has developed a
              computer laboratory to improve the teaching of statistics in undergraduate
              courses in the social sciences. A strong focus involves courses in economics
              and psychology and on students who do not have a strong background in
              mathematics. The central idea is to provide an environment where undergraduate
              students become active learners by actually doing statistics. This involves not
              only the generation, collection, and analysis of data but also the writing of
              scientific reports. Other activities include data storage, and the use of
              computer software and technology. The software includes a general purpose
              statistical package, and an integrated word processing and spreadsheet program
              which enables students to produce scientific reports based on their work.
