Abstract    :
              Dr. McDuff will continue her research into the structure of                    
              symplectic 4-manifolds.  For a long time she has been using the                
              theory of J-holomorphic curves in an attempt to classify them, and             
              has been quite successful in doing this for a restricted class of              
              manifolds (those which contain suitable 2-spheres).  The method                
              seems to be getting to its limit.  Meantime, Gompf and others have             
              found a new way to construct examples of symplectic 4-manifolds.               
              Dr. McDuff proposes a detailed analysis of the possibilities of                
              this construction to determine exactly where the J-holomorphic                 
              curve methods breaks down.  In addition, she will look for new                 
              invariants of symplectic 4-manifolds, and enlarge her own knowledge            
              by studying the new methods recently introduced into symplectic                
              topology, such as generating functions.                                        
                                                                                             
              Interactive activities at the host institution include:  leading a             
              seminar on New Developments in Symplectic Topology, and                        
              participating in the activities of the Noetherian Ring, the women              
              graduate student group in the Mathematics department at Berkeley.              
                                                                                             
              This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to                  
              provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in                    
              engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF and             
              (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and engineering            
              by providing greater visibility for women scientists and engineers             
              employed in industry, government, and academic institutions.  By               
              encouraging the participation of women in science, it is a valuable            
              investment in the Nation's future scientific vitality.
