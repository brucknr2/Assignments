Abstract    :
              9350013  Bifano  This REU Site focuses the summer research efforts of 9 
              undergraduates on projects relating to synthesis and  processing of advanced
              engineering materials.  The synthesis  research centers on development of CVD
              processes to create  ceramic and diamond films.  Synthesis also focuses on 
              fracture toughening of composites and ceramics, and systems  approaches to
              material crystallization.  The processing  research is concerned with unique
              fabrication technologies  that are necessary to obtain final component features
              on  advanced materials, including ultraprecision ductile-regime  machining of
              brittle materials.  ***
