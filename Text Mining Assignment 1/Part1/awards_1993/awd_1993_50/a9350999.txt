Abstract    :
              9350999  Natayan  An Emerging Scholars Program based on the success of the 
              Professional Development Program pioneered by Professor Uri  Treisman at the
              University of California at Berkeley is being  developed as a new joint
              initiative of the mathematics  department and the Mathematics Learning Center
              to increase the  number of minority students pursuing degrees in areas that 
              require strong mathematics and science preparation. Because the  existing
              computers in the Mathematics Department will be  heavily used in support of
              general mathematics courses, a  laboratory which can be dedicated specifically
              to students from  underrepresented groups is being developed. The laboratory
              will  serve two primary purposes: It will provide a center where  students
              learn to explore and solve mathematical problems with  the aid of the computer,
              faculty and tutors; It will provide a  facility where students can work
              individually or in groups in  an environment dedicated to cooperative learning.
