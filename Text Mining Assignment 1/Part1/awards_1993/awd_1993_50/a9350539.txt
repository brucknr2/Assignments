Abstract    :
              93-50539   Shreeve  Idaho Systemic Improvement Plan  The state of Idaho has a
              strategic vision - a clear image of what it wants to achieve - and a  strategic
              plan to reach its goals.  The vision is simple, confident and reality-based: 
              a) to identify  and develop a research capability in areas where Idaho
              scientists/engineers can first establish  regional preeminence and subsequently
              to use that research strength and capacity to emerge as  a national leader; b)
              to have its institutions of higher education gain a national reputation for 
              their educational superiority based upon a foundation of individual fulfillment
              in a dynamic  environment which promotes growth in science, engineering and
              mathematics education and  research; and c) to have a network of activities
              which provides for human resource development  and which introduces
              faculty/student research - and the knowledge that the research generates  - to
              the region's private sector industries and federal laboratories.  The years of
              the Idaho NSF  EPSCoR I program (FY 1989-92) were extraordinary in terms of
              positioning the state to reach  these goals.  EPSCoR I has helped Idaho to help
              itself.  As a result, the state is now fully  committed to a systematic,
              systemic improvement program for continuous development - in  quality and
              quantity - in science and engineering (S&E) research and education at each of
              its  institutions.
