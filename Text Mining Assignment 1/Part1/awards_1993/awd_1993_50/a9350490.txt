Abstract    :
              9350490  Moyer    This proposal seeks funds to develop and produce a set of 12 
              instructional video-based units on key topic in the life  science.  The video
              units are to be produced by The  Educational Film Center in association with
              the Montgomery  County (MD) School System and are designed to enrich  existing
              as well as newly developing life science curricula.   The units will provide a
              bridge for teachers as they  incorporate the new educational technology and
              modern  cognitive theory in their science reform curricula.  The  final
              products will consist of 12 video units both produced  in laser disc-software
              and video cassette-print formats and  teacher support materials directed to
              middle school  teachers.  ***
