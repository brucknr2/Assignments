Abstract    :
              9350953  Salafia                              This project has established a
              network of computers with  statistical and experimental software, and Internet
              connections, to  update and enhance a sequence of three methodology courses for
               undergraduate psychology majors. Two of the courses, Statistics and 
              Experimental Psychology Laboratory (EP Lab), are taken  consecutively by all
              psychology majors. The former introduces the  students to basic statistical
              concepts and continues through  factorial ANOVA. In EP Lab, students learn to
              read and analyze  research, develop hypotheses, design and conduct studies,
              apply  their statistical knowledge to data they've collected, and write up 
              their research. The final project in EP Lab involves an original  study which
              students are then encouraged to carry out in  Independent Research, the third
              of this integrated set of courses.  The laboratory is expected to increase the
              continuity among these  courses, and to introduce students to statistical
              software and  computer technology , and to encourage more students to pursue 
              independent research.
