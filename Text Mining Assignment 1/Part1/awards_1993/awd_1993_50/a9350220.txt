Abstract    :
              9350220  Williams       This research is oriented towards constraining the
              thermal and  chemical evolution of the Earth through high pressure experiments,
               with an emphasis on the interaction between material properties and  Earth
              problems.  This interdisciplinary focus also characterizes  the P.I.'s
              teaching, in which he is involved in developing thematic  approaches to Earth
              sciences curricula.
