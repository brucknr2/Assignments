Abstract    :
              This project is for computer laboratory equipment to support                   
              the development of an integrated land and water resources                      
              analysis curriculum. Lancaster County Pennsylvania offers                      
              excellent opportunities for studying interactions between land                 
              use activities and the resulting impacts on local water                        
              quantity and quality, and ultimately the Chesapeake Bay. We                    
              propose to integrate and enhance three courses--a GIS course,                  
              a hydrology course and a water resource management course--                    
              through the use of computers. This proposal will allow                         
              undergraduate students to develop a better understanding of                    
              environmental systems. They will also gain meaningful                          
              experience with two major uses of computers in environmental                   
              analysis, namely GlS and simulation.
