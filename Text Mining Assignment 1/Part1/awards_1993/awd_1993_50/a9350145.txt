Abstract    :
              Dr. Olmsted's research will primarily involve investigating the                
              role of structural microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) in                   
              microtubule organization and function.  Approaches that combine                
              immunological and high resolution light and electron microscopy                
              will be used to determine the distribution of MAP 4 in male gametic            
              cells and differentiating myoblasts.  Genetically engineered                   
              constructs transfected into cells will be examined for their                   
              effects on the organization of endogenous microtubule arrays and               
              other cellular structures.  Phenotypes generated by antisense                  
              experiments will be studied to see how absence of MAP 4 affects                
              miotic structures.  Electron microscopic analyses of microinjected             
              MAP 2 interactions with the Golgi will also be carried out.  Pilot             
              experiments to identify a MAP 4 homolog in Schizosaccharomyces                 
              pombe will also be undertaken.                                                 
                                                                                             
              Interactive activities at the host institution include:  presenting            
              a seminar on the choice of science as a career and the attraction              
              and retention of women into science; a graduate seminar on                     
              cytoskeletal-organelle interactions; guest lectures in introductory            
              and cell biology courses; and participation in weekly laboratory               
              meetings and seminars.                                                         
                                                                                             
              This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to                  
              provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in                    
              engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF and             
              (2) providing greater visibility for women scientists and engineers            
              employed in industry, government, and academic institutions.  By               
              encouraging the participation of women in science, it is a valuable            
              investment in the Nation's future scientific vitality.
