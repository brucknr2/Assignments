                      Rix  1 1 -                                 This project will equip a
              Nondestructive Evaluation of Infrastructure course to be offered to upper
              division civil engineering undergraduate students at Georgia Tech. The proposed
              course will introduce students to several nondestructive evaluation methods
              including (1) sonic and ultrasonic measurement of material properties, (2)
              defect and void detection, (3) acoustic emission monitoring, (4) optical
              generation and detection of ultrasound, (5) integrity t esting of foundations,
              (6) nondestructive pavement evaluation, and (7) ground penetrating radar
              applications. The requested equipment allows students to gain hands on
              experience with all of these NDE methods. This equipment includes ultrasonic
              generation, detection, and recording equipment for material characterization
              and defect detection; an acoustic emission system; a portable Fast Fourier
              Transform analyzer, instrumented hammer, and transducers for foundation
              integrity testing and pavement evaluation; and a high frequency transmitter and
              antenna for ground penetrating radar tests. The Georgia Department of
              Transportation is also supporting the proposed course by offering to
              demonstrate the use of its falling weight deflectometer for pavement
              evaluations.
