              Schools (NOPS) proposes a two step Urban Systemic Initiatives planning process.
               NOPS will determine the present state of K 12 Science, Mathematics and
              Technology (SMT) education in the district and then develop a reform plan,
              informed by the self study data, to implement a K 12 system which will provide
              a high quality SMT education for all students.  The planning process will be
              led by an Executive Committee (EC) chaired by the Superintendent and composed
              of NOPS representatives and other key stakeholders.  The EC will supervise the
              development of the implementation plan and recommend necessary changes in
              district policies and procedures.  The plan will be produced by an Advisory
              Board (AB) composed of members of the EC and the chairs of six review
              committees (RC).  The RCs, each charged with examining specific elements of the
              SMT education system, will collect, organize, and analyze data and submit
              recommendations to the AB.
