Abstract    :
              This project aims to reform the chemistry curriculum and                       
              increase retention through hands-on student use of                             
              visualization computers in introductory chemistry courses. Wide                
              variation in ability to comprehend concepts, poor college                      
              preparation and inadequate writing and language skills of many                 
              students, demand that concepts be presented in an engaging                     
              fashion so as to allow immediate grasp of principles regardless                
              of the students' background. Customized applications will be                   
              quickly and easily developed by combining courseware already                   
              written by the author with the large amount of shareware                       
              available at public archive sites and commercial software such                 
              as Mathematica, Interface Builder, and Renderman. This                         
              interactive courseware will be used to illustrate abstract                     
              concepts and model complex phenomena. Students will explore the                
              effect of changing parameters on a variety of complicated                      
              chemical systems. Pre-lab exercises using computer simulations                 
              will familiarize students with equipment and laboratory                        
              protocols before performing experiments.  Students will                        
              electronically mail data and lab reports, with graphics and                    
              sound annotations as well, and receive the instructor's voice-                 
              annotated and written comments in return.
