Abstract    :
              We propose a laboratory in which students will investigate the                 
              design and implementation of human-computer interfaces (HCIs). The             
              laboratory will enhance two courses currently taught at Appalachian            
              State University, Human-Computer Interface Design and Microcomputer            
              Systems. It will allow students to build prototypes of HCIs,                   
              compare HCI design options, create professional presentations of               
              HCI designs, and implement HCIs including graphical user interfaces            
              using an object-oriented language (C++) with appropriate software              
              library support. Currently, many undergraduates have little                    
              opportunity to explore the development of HCIs even though one-half            
              of many software development projects involve the development of               
              the human-computer interface. The current situation leaves many                
              undergraduates woefully unprepared for current practice in                     
              software development. Our proposal helps to alleviate this                     
              problem by exposing these students to the difficult design                     
              decisions and programming techniques that arise in HCI                         
              development through the use of supervised and unsupervised                     
              laboratory exercises.
