Abstract    :
              This project is intended to improve the mathematics instruction                
              by making effective use of state-of-the-art computers and                      
              associated technological equipment. Innovations in the teaching                
              of mathematical concepts have been made possible by advances in                
              computer hardware and software. We need to ensure that our                     
              teachers can use these technological advances to their fullest                 
              potential. This project will establish a laboratory to provide                 
              practical classroom activities and demonstrations for                          
              prospective elementary and secondary teachers.We will replace                  
              our outdated lab of Apple II computers with a network of                       
              Macintosh workstations, a file server, a CD-ROM player, a video                
              disk player and a scanner. This local network will be connected                
              to our existing campus network and through it to the internet,                 
              giving our students access to a growing network connecting                     
              elementary and secondary post-secondary educators.For our                      
              education students in mathematics to be trained to teach at a                  
              world-class level, they need experiences on state-of-the-art                   
              equipment. This equipment will enable our students to learn                    
              problem solving strategies, programming, and applications on                   
              equipment that will be the latest currently available. Thus,                   
              our students will be able to contribute their expertise to the                 
              community-at-large upon graduation.
