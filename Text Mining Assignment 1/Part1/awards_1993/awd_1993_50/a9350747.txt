Abstract    :
              The physics program presently supports an introductory                         
              laboratory environment which encourages students to design                     
              their own experimental approaches to problems and communicate                  
              those approaches in an informal manner.  Laboratory activities                 
              are heavily oriented toward exploratory planning activities                    
              with an emphasis on graphical presentation and analysis of                     
              data.  The student directed experimental design coupled with                   
              graphical analysis requires that large amounts of data must be                 
              rapidly acquired, and analyzed.  To support this need 10                       
              networked micro-computer based data acquisition and analysis                   
              systems, together with a variety of sensors, are being                         
              introduced in the laboratory.  Each micro-computer provides an                 
              icon oriented interface (Lab-View) consisting of virtual                       
              instruments and virtual probes that may be schematically linked                
              to reflect individual student approaches toward an experimental                
              problem.  High level commands allow the students to acquire,                   
              display, and analyze data ways which they find most meaningful.                
              The computing environment is sufficiently powerful to include                  
              new probes as demand warrants, and thus provides added                         
              incentive for more advanced students to attempt alternative                    
              experimental strategies. The flexibility in the icon oriented                  
              interface also allows the laboratory to gracefully adapt to new                
              experiments and to individual learning styles, thereby                         
              enhancing student development of science skills and concept                    
              understanding.
