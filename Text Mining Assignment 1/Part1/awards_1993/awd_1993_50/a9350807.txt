Abstract    :
              The laser is an indispensable tool in many fields of science                   
              and engineering. The University of Alaska, Fairbanks (UAF) is                  
              providing a comprehensive, undergraduate-level, one-semester                   
              laser laboratory course which follows an existing one-semester                 
              course in classical optics (with lab). Over the last several                   
              years UAF has accumulated a wide variety of lasers for the                     
              laser lab. In particular, we have an Argon ion laser, a                        
              flashlamp-pumped dye laser, a nitrogen laser, a nitrogen laser-                
              pumped dye laser, a number of helium-neon lasers, and a Nd:YAG                 
              laser.This project is obtaining the final instruments which                    
              will allow us to offer this course to our students.  In                        
              particular, we are obtaining: a calibrated Joule meter to                      
              measure the pulse energy in the various pulsed lasers; a diode                 
              array for our grating spectrometer so we can measure laser                     
              spectra "single shot;" another diode array to measure spatial                  
              beam profiles; a diode laser to fill a hole in our laser                       
              inventory; a helium-neon tube with Brewster windows and a set                  
              of external mirrors so that the students can get the experience                
              of aligning several different cavities (confocal,                              
              hemispherical, and flat-flat) for a fixed gain medium; a data                  
              logger so we can use our scanning grating spectrometer (with                   
              photomultiplier tube) to measure the tuning curve of the pulsed                
              nitrogen laser-pumped dye laser, a set of output couplers with                 
              a range of transmittances for the Argon ion laser so that the                  
              students can see the difference in gain between the 514 nm line                
              and the 488 nm line; and several pairs of safety goggles so                    
              that the students can safely use the Nd:YAG laser.Given the                    
              importance of the laser in contemporary science we are doing                   
              our students a great service by providing this course whether                  
              they choose to go to graduate school or enter the job market                   
              immediately.
