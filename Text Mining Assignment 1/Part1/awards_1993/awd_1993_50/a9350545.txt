Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Ventures In education program is built on a successful                     
              twelve-year experience of establishing academic rigor in                       
              poorly performing high schools.  It is based on the                            
              fundamental premise that all children can master a rigorous                    
              curriculum--one that provides adequate preparation for careers                 
              in a high technology society.                                                  
                                                                                             
              Ventures will work with seventy economically disadvantaged                     
              senior and junior high schools in five geographic locations,                   
              to implement school-wide an academically rigorous, science-                    
              intensive course of study.  (The students enrolled in these                    
              schools are from minority and economically disadvantaged                       
              backgrounds.)  A comprehensive approach will be employed                       
              attending both to the content of the science and mathematics                   
              courses, and to the development of the academic skills                         
              underlying successful performance.  An extensive program of                    
              teacher enhancement will include direct in-the classroom                       
              guidance and assistance.                                                       
                                                                                             
              This intellectually demanding curriculum will be supplemented                  
              by school-based summer programs for entering 9th- and/or 10th-                 
              graders and a residential college-based summer program for                     
              rising 11th- and 12th-graders.                                                 
                                                                                             
              The participating seventy senior and junior high schools are                   
              located in Alabama, Arkansas, New York City, Washington, D.C.,                 
              and on the Navajo Reservation.  When the programs are fully                    
              implemented, they will enroll a total of 40,000 students and                   
              will graduate annually 10,000 youngsters.  Each year, of those                 
              10,000 graduates, 25 percent--or 2,000-3,000 students--will                    
              have completed a rigorous college preparatory program,                         
              designed to enable them to succeed in college courses                          
              necessary for careers in science, engineering or mathematics.                  
              Most of these students will be from minority groups that                       
              currently are under-represented in the scientific labor force.                 
              Thus, Ventures will significantly advance the NSF objective of                 
              reducing, or eliminating, the gap in minority science                          
              participation before the year 2000.                                            
                                                                                             
              In addition to providing an excellent education to thousands                   
              of America's future scientists, the project seeks to seed a                    
              national model which will move the public schools from the                     
              current phase of failure and frustration to one of solid                       
              academic success.  By institutionalizing rigorous science                      
              curricula in seventy schools in five geographically and                        
              ethnically diverse sites, Ventures intends to crystalize the                   
              reform agenda around the issues of academic rigor and                          
              excellence for all students.
