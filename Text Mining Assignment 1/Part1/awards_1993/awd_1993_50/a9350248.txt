Abstract    :
                9350248  McConnell    Neurons migrate to unique positions and form specific
              axonal  connections within the developing cerebral cortex.  This  Presidential
              Faculty Fellow award will allow this investigator  to explore the cellular and
              molecular mechanisms that control  neuronal migration and axonal growth. 
              Transplantation of  developing cells in the cortex will be used to probe the 
              cellular interactions that mold neuronal function.  ***
