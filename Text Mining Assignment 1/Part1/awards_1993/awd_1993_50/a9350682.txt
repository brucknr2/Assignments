Abstract    :
              9350682  Bornhorst   The project will improve the instructional program by the 
              establishment of a computer data-acquisition laboratory,  consisting of sixteen
              personal computers and SciTech data  acquisition interfaces, to make all of the
              electronic  measurements required in a lower division college chemistry  class.
              The laboratory systems will be tied to the existing  department and campus
              Novell network by upgraded NetWare 3.11  software and a dedicated 486 file
              server. Experiments will be  designed to enhance discovery exercises to enable
              students to  investigate phenomena and perform calculations rapidly and 
              transparently to look for trends and inconsistencies in  experimental data to
              shift the focus to one of exploration. The  emphasis of the laboratory will be
              to improve laboratory  skills, learn chemical concepts, design experimental 
              procedures, experiment like a scientist, and produce meaningful  results and
              reports.  ***y
