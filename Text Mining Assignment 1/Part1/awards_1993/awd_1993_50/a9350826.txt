Abstract    :
              Acquisition of a flame graphite furnace atomic absorption                      
              spectrophotometer will improve instruction in the theory and                   
              applications of this method and will allow new experiments to                  
              be introduced in the following laboratory courses:                             
              Physicochemical Methods of Experimentation I & II, Basic                       
              Laboratory Methods I & II, and Biochemistry Laboratory I. The                  
              new instrumentation will further enhance undergraduate research                
              activities in chemistry and biology by allowing students in                    
              Independent Study to directly collect, interpret, and integrate                
              chemical information that has relevance to their discipline. It                
              will also strengthen the summer science research program which                 
              involves undergraduates, secondary school teachers and                         
              secondary school students.
