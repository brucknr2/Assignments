Abstract    :
              SSC-9350547  French River Education Center, Inc.  N. Oxford, MA   Hamadeh, Ann,
              Lou Horner, Michael Fields, Bernard Brown, and Josephine Corro      This
              project conducts the "On DEC 2000" Summer Science Camp, a four-week science 
              enrichment and career exploration project designed for fifty Black and Pacific
              Islander inner city  seventh grade students. The project represents an alliance
              between the Boston Public Schools  and, among others, Digital Equipment
              Corporation in which students participate for three  consecutive summers. 
              Students are exposed initially to careers in chemistry, physics,  astronomy,
              engineering, and computing technology, through hands-on activities, guest
              speakers,  mentors, and field trips to area universities and colleges. 
              Returning students will select three  of these courses for in-depth study in
              the second year, while third year students enroll in the  course that most
              interests them and devote the entire summer to its study.  New "freshmen" 
              classes are recruited annually.  Academic year follow-up activities include
              after-school science  clubs and a "Science by Mail" program with the Boston
              Museum of Science.
