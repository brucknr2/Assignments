Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project would planfor the development of a unified environment            
              where researfh mathematicians, scholars in mathematic education,               
              school and college teachers, skilled programmers, amd material                 
              developers can interact to develop materials for mathematics                   
              education at all levels.  The central focus would be geometric                 
              visualization.  High priority in the major project would be on the             
              development of materials which were easy to use for both teacher               
              and student and upon dissemination.  The materials to be developed             
              would include computer programs, narrated videos, text materials,              
              and manipulatives.                                                             
                                                                                             
              The planning process would include the establishment of contacts               
              and ties with various producers of visualization materials,                    
              commercial publishers, nationwide curriculumprojects, and experts              
              in dissemination and testing, as well as mathematics education                 
              specialists and schooland college teachers.
