Abstract    :
              9350825  Whisnant  The goal of this project is to complete the development of a 
              series of general chemistry laboratory experiments which  reflect the practice
              of modern chemistry.  The two-semester  series of experiments is structured as
              a set of multi-  experiment projects which give students an early introduction 
              to modern instruments and to the different fields of chemistry.   A diode-array
              UV/visible spectrophotometer is being used for a  discovery-based organic
              spectroscopy project in which 32  students record the spectra of a number of
              compounds in one  class period.  It also is being used for a phosphate analysis
               which, for the low levels of phosphorus often found in natural  water,
              requires a sensitive instrument capable of accommodating  long path lengths
              cells.  Finally, it also is being used in a  coordination chemistry project.
