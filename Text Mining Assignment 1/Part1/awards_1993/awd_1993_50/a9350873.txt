Abstract    :
              The proposed project is to provide hands-on experience in                      
              communication techniques, relating theoretical concepts to                     
              practical circuits and processes. The main emphasis will be in                 
              digital communication. A wide range of experiments will be                     
              performed in analog signalling such as linear modulation                       
              methods and digital signalling such as pulse shaping. Spectrum                 
              analysis of digital modulation schemes, and bit error rate                     
              analysis will also be included. The practical experience the                   
              student will gain in the laboratory will supplement and                        
              reinforce both analog and digital communication concepts                       
              learned in the Communication lecture course. Major equipment                   
              include modulation systems. This equipment will also be used                   
              for the design of Senior Projects.
