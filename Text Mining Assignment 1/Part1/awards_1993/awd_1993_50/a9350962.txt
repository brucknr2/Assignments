Abstract    :
              9350962  Rudmann  This project has established a social and behavioral sciences 
              computer laboratory that introduces undergraduate students to  computer-based
              social science research. To fully understand and  appreciate the scientific
              dimensions of the social sciences,  students are actively involved in
              conducting research, and are  encouraged to become scientifically literate,
              self-directed,  computer literate learners. Students also study social science 
              issues with real data, using state of the art hardware and  software. With this
              foundation, majors are expected to be much  better prepared for upper division
              work, while non-majors will have  an enhanced understanding and appreciation
              for the scientific basis  of social science knowledge.  ***
