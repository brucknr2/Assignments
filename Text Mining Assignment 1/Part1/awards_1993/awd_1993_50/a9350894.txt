Abstract    :
              Sampling equipment is being installed on the vessels SSV                       
              Corwith Cramer  and SSV Westward.  These vessels are being used                
              for undergraduate education in the Sea Education Association                   
              (SEA) Semester program and for high school through adult                       
              education in SEA Seminar programs.  SEA is expanding its                       
              sampling capabilities into two areas: subsurface water sampling                
              and coastal environmental and geological surveys.  Intelligent                 
              rosette sampling systems are permitting accurate deep water                    
              sampling and beach/landscape survey gear to be used in field                   
              trips in Woods Hole and during the various stops made by each                  
              vessel during research cruises.  SEA's primary goal in                         
              equipping the vessels is to install a multi component system of                
              sampling and analytical gear that enables users with a wide                    
              range of technical backgrounds to participate in modern                        
              oceanographic research.
