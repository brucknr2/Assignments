Abstract    :
              9353082  Allen    This conference proposal brings a total of 75 teachers from
              across  the country to the Supercomputing '93 conference held in Portland,  OR,
              for special educators' workshops and presentations.  The two-  days of sessions
              include hands-on workshops, presentations and  demonstrations including some
              given by representatives of currently  successful high school supercomputing
              programs.  Teachers will also  have a chance to visit the exhibits, poster
              session, and special  presentations at the conference.    Cost sharing is
              providing hardware for the workshops, cables and  connections, busses for
              Sunday and Monday, other supplies,  printing, postage and advertising costs. 
              This is estimated at 41%  of the project.
