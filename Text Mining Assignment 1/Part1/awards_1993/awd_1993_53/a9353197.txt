Abstract    :
              9353197 Cabrera The proposal requests funds to establish a materials
              characterization facility with the acquisition of surface analytical
              instrumentation.  The instrumentation consists of an Auger electron
              spectrometer and an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer and will aid current
              research in environmental chemistry, thin films, catalysis, materials science
              and electrochemistry.  The surface analytical instrumentation will specifically
              enhance the research on the processing of transition metal dichalcogenides and
              ferroelectric films, by determining the composition of majority elements, as
              well as impurities.  The dichalcogenides and ferroelectric films are used for
              solar energy batteries and optical-electrical devices, respectively.  The
              impurity composition can significantly affect the semiconductive and magnetic
              properties of the materials, which are usually prepared by chemical vapor
              deposition, sol-gel techniques or electrodeposition.  The material
              characterization facility will dramatically improve the interpretative
              capabilities of the researchers investigating fundamentally the processing of
              the foregoing materials. ***
