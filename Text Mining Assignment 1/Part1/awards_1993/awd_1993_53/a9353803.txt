Abstract    :
              9353803  Lobos    Supporting Girls in Science Endeavors will link school and
              community groups to encourage  upper elementary and middle school girls and
              their families in active science pursuits.   Cranbrook Institute of Science, a
              science museum north of Detroit, will be the catalyst for this  effort which
              will bring together more than 75 professionals and associations already
              recognized  for their focus on science issues.  The museum will initiate this
              collaborative effort which is  expected to reach more than 800 girls with
              sustained science programming.    Four specific tasks will be included in the
              year-long effort: 1) Science Programs for Girls  consisting of direct hands-on
              science activities, 2) Parent Support Activities comprised of family  centered
              events, including seminars and a newsletter, 3) a conference for leaders of
              organizations  interested in science for girls and 4) a Network for science
              program leaders and teachers.  The  result of this effort is expected to be a
              dedicated corps of adult leaders and parents who can  knowledgeably encourage
              girls in science, and more than 800 girls whose positive experiences  and new
              contacts will sustain their interests in science.  ***
