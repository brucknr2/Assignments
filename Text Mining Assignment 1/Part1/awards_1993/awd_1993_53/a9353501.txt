Abstract    :
              9353501  Mansfield    The Southeastern Regional Education Service Center
              (SERESC) of New  Hampshire addresses the needs of twelve school districts that 
              include 20 elementary and 10 middle schools, representing 25% of  the states
              total K-12 enrollment.  With guidance from the SERESC  staff, these districts
              have studied their needs and created action  plans for the implementation of
              hands-on inquiry-based science  instruction in elementary and middle schools
              throughout the region.  SERESC is now planning to coordinate an important
              reform effort  within each district and to create a regional network of 
              collaborating reformers.  Two teachers and a principal from each of  these
              schools will receive training as instructional leaders for  science and agents
              of systemic change in their districts.  Teachers  will receive content
              instruction, evaluate instructional material  (e.g., EDC Insights, BSCS, TIMS,
              Microcosmos, Kids Net), construct  grade-level instructional plans, develop
              strategies for curriculum  integration, and design assessment vehicles.    The
              proposed project has the potential for substantial impact  throughout the
              region of southeastern New Hampshire, and it can  serve as a model for other
              regional consortia of small school  districts.     Cost sharing amounts to 42%
              of the NSF contribution.  ***
