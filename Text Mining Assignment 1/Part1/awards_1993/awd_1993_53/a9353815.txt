Abstract    :
              9353815  Holland       This proposal requests partial funding for a four-day
              workshop  of selected members of the Ecological Society of America (ESA) to 
              develop a strategic plan for the recruitment and retention of women  and
              minorities in the field of ecology.  ESA is the major  scientific society for
              ecologists in the United States with a  membership of approximately 7,000.  The
              impetus for this proposal  was a survey of the association membership which
              indicated that  women and minorities are underrepresented in this field.  ***
