                                 Mathematical Sciences Sequential Summer Institute for High
              School  Mathematics Teachers    This 3-year master's degree program for 30
              well-prepared high  school teachers (selected state-wide) builds on a current,
              state-  supported project:  Making Mathematics Accessible to All (MMAA).   The
              program includes 3 sequential summers of mathematics courses in  such areas as:
              discrete mathematics, statistics and probability,  dynamical systems,
              transformational geometry, matrix algebra, etc.   All courses in the program
              stress: applications and mathematical  modeling, the uses of computers and
              graphing calculators, long-term  projects requiring cooperative group efforts,
              and writing about  mathematics.  To complement the sequential summer program,
              in each  of the 3 academic years, participants take an additional course, 
              including 2 mathematics education courses that focus on issues of  curriculum;
              pedagogy; assessment; and the teacher as a thoughtful  practioner, researcher,
              and mentor.  These year-long courses  include 6 2-day meetings on campus and a
              staff site-visit to each  partcipant's school, but more frequent interaction
              between  participants and staff will be faciliatted by MichNet.  A post- 
              program evaluation study will document the participants'  professional
              activites and the kinds of leadership roles they  assume.      Cost-sharing is
              23% of the NSF contribution.
