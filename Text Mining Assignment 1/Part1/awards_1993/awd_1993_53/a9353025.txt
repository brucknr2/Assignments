Abstract    :
              9353025  Schneider    In this project the Children's Television Workshop will
              develop  innovative instructional materials based on its Square One TV 
              television series to supplement mathematics curricula for the  fourth, fifth,
              and sixth grades.  The project will develop twenty  instructional modules of
              single-topic television programs and  videos for use in the classroom as well
              as teacher enhancement  videotapes and print packages and a teacher-parent
              video.  Each  video will be approximately fifteen minutes in length.  The 
              classroom materials will present sound mathematical content in an  interesting,
              accessible, and meaningful manner which encourages the  use of problem solving
              processes and promotes positive toward and  enthusiasm for mathematics.  Field
              testing and evaluation of the  materials will be included in the project. 
              Partnerships with PBS  and the NETWORK will contribute to the dissemination of
              the  materials.
