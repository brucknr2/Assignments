Abstract    :
              SSC-9353287  New Mexico Museum of Natural History  Albuquerque, NM    Matthew,
              Kathryn and McGuire, Susan    "Minority Family Workshop:  Water Ecology
              Project"      The New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science seeks to 
              improve the science literacy of Native American middle school  students through
              an expansion of its successful Water Ecology  Project.  This program takes
              Native American youngsters, a group  that is under-represented in science, and
              exposes them to hands-on  activities to give them a more realistic
              understanding of science  careers.  To carry out this project, partnerships
              have been formed  between the Museum and governmental agencies and educational 
              institutions.  These partnerships have been designed to provide  middle school
              students with a broad exposure to science-based  careers in New Mexico.  Using
              water quality monitoring as a theme  unifies all of the student activities
              associated with this project.   Water quality, water conservation, and the
              ecology of riparian  areas are of great concern to the arid southwestern US. 
              This theme  has been chosen to facilitate the involvement of whole families and
               rural communities in the program.  The community-and family-support  produced
              through the choice of this theme is intended to reinforce  the shifts in
              student attitudes toward science.  Thus, this project  is wellsuited for Native
              American students whose sense of self if  often strongly influenced by family.
