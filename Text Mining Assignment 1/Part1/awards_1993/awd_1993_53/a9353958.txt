Abstract    :
              9353958  Lim  In the past few years, object-oriented technology has become  one
              of the dominant technologies in the computing industry.  In  a recent survey,
              it was reported that over 75% of the Fortune  100 companies have adopted object
              technology to some degree for  their computing needs.  This is in response to
              the increasing  software maintenance cost and backlog that is so prevalent in 
              the software industry.  Because object-orientation is becoming  one of the
              primary means for problem solving, the need to teach  object-orientation in
              undergraduate curriculum is growing.    The purpose of this project is to
              provide a two-week summer  workshop for faculty who are from institutions which
              lack  computing facilities to teach object-orientation and thus do  not have
              any formal training in this area.  The objectives are  to introduce (1)
              object-orientated analysis and design, (2)  object-oriented programming, (3)
              object oriented databases, (4)  integrating object-orientation into computer 
              science/information system curriculum, and (5) teaching object-  orientation to
              undergraduates.  The workshop includes lectures  and laboratory sessions in
              which participants have hands-on  exercises on each of the above main topics. 
              Participants  also  plan  a course or course unit utilizing object-oriented 
              technology at their institutions during the subsequent academic  year.  The
              tools used in the workshop include inexpensive or  free software that are
              easily obtainable by most universities  and colleges.  ***
