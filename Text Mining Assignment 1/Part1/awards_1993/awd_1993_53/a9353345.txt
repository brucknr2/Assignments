Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This planning grant will lead to a full proposal from                          
              Illinois State University to support systemic change in                        
              science education in the region.  The planning grant brings                    
              together representatives from the schools, universities,                       
              Educational Service Centers, and others who have experience                    
              or interest in local school change.  This team makes on-site                   
              visits to successful schools and uses consultants in school                    
              change and science education to help formulate a plan for a                    
              broader project.  A one-week summer symposium is used to                       
              design strategies to support improvements in science                           
              education.  The report generated by the symposium is                           
              intended to be used as a basis of a full proposal and for                      
              local systems to develop system change plans for their                         
              schools.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              The planning grant begins the examination and compilation of                   
              strategies that will lead to a Teacher Enhancement proposal.                   
              The cost sharing is estimated at 17%
