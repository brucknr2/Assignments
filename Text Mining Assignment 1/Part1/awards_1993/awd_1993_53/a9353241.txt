Abstract    :
              SSC-9353241  San Diego State Univ. Fdn.  San Diego, CA    Park, Cynthia D.   
              "Summer Science and Technology to Advance Research Skills (SSTARS)    The
              Math/Science Regional Center at San Diego State University  proposes a
              three-year Summer Science and Technology experience to  Advance Research Skills
              (SSTARS) for 50 students entering 9th  grade.  The San Diego County schools
              which are located in the South  Bay and Skyline areas include representation
              from each of the  predominant ethnic/racial groups in those areas.    The
              project consists of two closely related parts:  a four-week  summer residential
              program on the San Diego State University campus  and an academic year
              follow-up for students selected in Spring  1993.  The summer session offers
              entering 9th graders an  experimental pre-geometry class and a geometry
              computer lab, as  well as an interdisciplinary earth science course which
              integrates  a workshops in career exploration and adolescent problems.  A 
              technical writing class using Hypercard allows students to document  their
              findings in innovative and expressive ways.    All students participate in a
              research project, as well as  environmental field trips which supplement the
              courses.  This  includes a mentoring program in which university science
              faculty  will work up to four hours weekly with small groups of students.   
              Each succeeding project year (1994, 1995) will be a recapitulation  of the 1993
              project year described in detail on the pages which  follow.  Students
              graduating from SSTARS will be able to continue  summer science study at any
              one of 15 specialized Upward Bound  Math/Science Centers in Federal Region IX.
