Abstract    :
              9353071  Jones    The research team proposes to examine the primary factors
              affecting  the participation of African Americans in science, mathematics, and 
              engineering programs at Historically Black Colleges and  Universities (HBCUs). 
              Case studies of two groups of HBCUs will be  performed:  A group of HBCUs that
              have had increasing numbers of  SEM graduates in recent years will be
              contrasted with a group that  have bee experiencing decreasing degree
              completions.  The research  team will use existing data, interviews, and focus
              groups to  identify the primary factors responsible for success and failure of 
              these HBCUs.  The research will place emphasis on the effect  increased levels
              of Federal assistance has had on HBCU  undergraduate programs.  ***
