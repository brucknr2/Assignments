Abstract    :
              9353066  Wisnieski    The University of California at Los Angeles will sponsor a
              4-  week, residential Young Scholars project in biology for 25  physically
              disabled students entering grades 11 and 12.  Small  group activities are
              featured.  Lectures by appropriate role re-  enforce career options.  Special
              discussions, cooperative group  activities and lab exercises explore topics in
              physiology,  ecology and microbiology.  Ethics of science discussions complete 
              the summer component.  A series of follow-up sessions that  includes a student 
              presentation at his/her school concludes the  project activities.  ***
