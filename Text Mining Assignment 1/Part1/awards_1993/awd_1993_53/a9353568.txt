Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The planning grant is to develop a proposal for a                              
              comprehensive statewide math and science program for                           
              teachers in grades 9-12 in which basic concepts from math                      
              and science will serve to unify themes, methodologies,                         
              activities, materials and assessment strategies.  The                          
              program will continue and build on the K-8 SSI grant.                          
              Groups of teachers and administrators will meet and plan the                   
              workshops and curricula which will be a part of the                            
              proposal.
