Abstract    :
              935300  Hamrin    The University of Kentucky will initiate a 3-week, residential
               Young Scholars project in engineering for 30 students entering  grades 11 or
              12.  Project activities will include lectures on  basic engineering principles
              and hands-on computer experiences in  graphics, CAD and engineering
              applications.  Mini-research  projects will be integrated into these
              activities.  The core of  the summer program will focus on four main
              disciplines: chemical,  civil, electrical and mechanical engineering.  Career 
              explorations, discussions on ethics of science and student  research
              presentations are also featured.  During the follow up  activities, students
              complete an individual project and return to  campus for seminar presentations
              of these projects.  ***
