Abstract    :
              9353094  Gardner    This project is continuing the development and testing of
              dotsplus, a tactile printing technique  that incudes both braille and raised
              graphic images.  Dotsplus is primarily intended for  mathematics, science,
              engineering, and other technical documents for which braille is very 
              cumbersome or impossible.  Project activities include the conduct of wider
              tests and continued  development of supporting technology. The project director
              is collaborating with braille  authorities and with a group developing a
              tactile computer screen.  He is also working with  several European groups on
              technological developments and methodology for education of  disabled students
              on making mathematics symbols on computer screens accessible, and on  document
              storage standards.    ***
