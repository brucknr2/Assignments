Abstract    :
              SSC-9353244  Rensselaer Polytech Inst.  Troy, NY  Smith, Mark    Rensselaer
              Polytechnic Institute proposes to design and implement  a five-week residential
              Summer Science Enrichment Program for fifty  entering 7th, 8th and 9th grade
              minority students per year, July 1,   1993 - June 30, 1996.  The principal
              objective is to design the  summer experience to use Cognitive Apprenticeship
              and project team  approaches to facilitate learning and problem solving skills.
               The  summer program will model science and engineering processes using  a
              project-oriented, problem solving instructional format.   Participants will be
              selected from target schools in Albany,  Schenectady and Troy City School
              Districts, New york State.   Participants will form ten 5-member teams, each
              team working on a  project to be completed at the conclusion of the summer.  
              Coursework will consist of a technology lab, chemistry lab and  research
              shills.  Supplemental activities will consist of career  exploration in the
              sciences, engineering and health professions,  field trips to local industry
              and science museums, recreational  activities, team competitions, and a
              mentoring component using  Rensselaer faculty and professional scientists and
              engineers.   Instructional staff will be selected from local schools and 
              residential teaching assistants will be selected from Rensselaer 
              undergraduate/graduate students.  Participants will enroll in  Rensselaer's
              academic year precollege programs to continue the  efforts begun during the
              summer.  The planned outcome from  participation in the Summer Science
              Enrichment Program is to  prepare participants to pursue high school coursework
              that will  equip them with the kinds of skills and knowledge leading to 
              postsecondary education and careers in the sciences, engineering  and health
              professions.
