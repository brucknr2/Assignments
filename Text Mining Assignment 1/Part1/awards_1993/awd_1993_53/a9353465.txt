Abstract    :
              9353465  Babu    This 36-month project supports the efforts of the Connecticut 
              statewide systemic initiative in Connecticut by providing  minicourses and
              resources to teachers in the 67 local school  districts.  The project delivers
              short courses ranging from 2 to 14  hours to teachers on topics identified by
              the needs assessment.   Summer sessions are one or two weeks long and "provide
              a forum for  additional instruction and acquisition of skills, and for 
              networking and sharing of problems and ideas."  Academic year  institutes
              include topics like Early Childhood Math, Marine Science  Project: For Sea,
              Music and Science in the Classroom.    Key to this project is that the local
              community or staff identify  their needs and receive support and help in those
              area.  Partners  in this project include the university, all school districts,
              and  the local community.  In this proposal, 45 schools are connected  via the
              Internet so they can reach mentors, share resources, and  interact with their
              colleagues in conjunction with and after the  workshops.    Cost sharing is
              estimated at 71%
