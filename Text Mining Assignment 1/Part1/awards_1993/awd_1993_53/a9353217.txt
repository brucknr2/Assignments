Abstract    :
              9353217  Alcoze    The proposed Native Science Connections (NCS) project is 
              designed to develop culturally relevant science modules that  complement the
              existing science curricula in grades 4  through 6.  The curricular materials in
              science and  mathematics will focus on four Native American tribal  nations: 
              Zuni, Hopi, Apache and Dine (Navajo) and will  demonstrate the existence and
              validity of Native American  sciences and mathematics as they are manifested
              within the  traditions and cultures of the original peoples of the  Americas. 
              The project will be directed and developed by  experienced Native Americans
              science teachers and education  professionals.  Materials produced from this
              project include  four science modules that will be developed around 
              environmental themes.  They will be used in both Native  American and
              mainstream classrooms.  ***
