Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This planning project will involve eight Tennessee universities,               
              the Center of Excellence for Science and Mathematics Education,                
              public schools, and state agencies in the development of a                     
              comprehensive systematic state-wide program of improvement in                  
              elementary science and associated mathematics for schools                      
              throughout the state.  The project developed will prepare teachers             
              to implement exemplary science education experiences which are                 
              congruent with the emerging NSTA standards and which employ                    
              contemporary educational technology.                                           
                                                                                             
              The nature of the cooperative activities among the eight                       
              universities and the participating schools and agencies will ensure            
              that the best talent in the state will be available to plan,                   
              provide, and evaluate professional development activities for                  
              teachers.  A variety of innovative delivery techniques including               
              compressed video and satellite will integral features of this                  
              project.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              Planning activities, leading to the submission of a teacher                    
              enhancement proposal, will be conducted over a one year period.                
              These planning activities will involve all shareholders in                     
              elementary science education in Tennessee.  This project partially             
              fulfills one of the major goals of the Tennessee Systemic                      
              Initiative.//
