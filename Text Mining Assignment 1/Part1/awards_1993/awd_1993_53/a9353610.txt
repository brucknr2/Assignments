Abstract    :
              9353610  McBay  Economic and social trends have greatly reduced the number of 
              minorities entering the teaching profession while,  simultaneously, demographic
              trends have greatly increased the  number of minority students and the number
              of predominantly  minority schools, particularly in urban areas.  Minority 
              teachers are especially needed to address the crisis in  educational quality
              existing in urban communities, particularly  in schools attended by students
              residing in low-income  public housing.  The Quality Education for Minorities
              (QEM)  Network will conduct a small Working Conference to:  focus on  the
              issues, review results of current efforts, and  consider potential designs for
              a comprehensive and  collaborative strategy to significantly increase the
              number of  well-prepared minority mathematics and science teachers; and 
              produce and disseminate a set of written guidelines for  developing a
              comprehensive strategy.  The 32 participants will  include representatives of
              two- and four-year colleges and  universities and of middle and junior high
              schools serving  predominantly minority students bodies; residents of 
              neighboring low-income public housing served by these  institutions;
              non-minority institutions with strong teacher  education programs and track
              records in serving minority  students; and professional educational and
              scientific  organizations.  ***
