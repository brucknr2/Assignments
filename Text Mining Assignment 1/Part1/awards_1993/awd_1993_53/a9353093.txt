Abstract    :
              9353093     Friedlander  Dr. Friedlander's recent research involves the study of
              certain  problems related to the equation of hydrodynamics (the Euler 
              equations and the Navier-Strokes equations) and to the extended  system of the
              equations of magnetohydrodynamics.  The mathematics  employed includes
              techniques from partial differential equations,  asymptotic methods and
              dynamical systems.  The problems studied are   motivated by questions that
              arise in geophysical and astrophysical  fluid dynamics.  This research project
              will involve joint work with  M.M. Vishik.  Dr. Friedlander will continue her
              investigation of  several facets of these problems.  The research is described
              under  four headings:  (I) The "fast" dynamo problem; (II) Instability 
              criteria for the Euler equations; (III) The existence of a complete  system of
              Floquet root vectors in time periodic of fluid dynamics;  (IV)
              Magnetohydrodynamic stability.    Interactive activities at the host
              institution include:  (1)  teaching a graduate course on mathematical topics in
              fluid  dynamics; (2) mentoring and counseling women students and postdocs  in
              the mathematical sciences; and (3) organizing a two-day workshop  of colloquium
              style lectures given by distinguished women  mathematicians.    This project
              furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to  provide opportunities for
              women to advance their careers in  engineering and in the disciplines of
              science supported by NSF and  (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in
              science and engineering  by providing greater visibility for women scientists
              and engineers  employed in industry, government, and academic institutions.  By
               encouraging the participation of women in science, it is a valuable 
              investment in the Nation's future significantly.  ***
