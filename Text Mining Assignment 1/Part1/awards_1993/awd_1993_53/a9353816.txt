Abstract    :
              9353816  Staver    This planning proposal will coordinate organizations and 
              resources in North Central Kansas around a collaborative effort  to improve
              rural elementary science teaching.  A partnership  among the North Central
              Kansas Educational Service Center, the  Center for Science Education at Kansas
              State University, and  Cloud County Community College as been created through
              this  process to address the science needs in this region.  This  collaborative
              partnership will develop a project designed to  implement hands-on science in
              rural school districts by preparing  elementary teachers to become local and
              regional facilitators of  quality hands-on science instruction.  The project
              will also  design a mechanism for providing teachers with implementation 
              assistance, administrative support, and instructional materials.    The cost
              sharing will be 229% of the NSF request.  Cost sharing  will come from Kansas
              State University, North Central Kansas  Educational Service Center, and Cloud
              County Community College.  ***
