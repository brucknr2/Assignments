Abstract    :
              9353490  Stanley    This exhibit will integrate graphics, artifacts, highly 
              interactive electro-mechanical demonstration devices together  with state of
              the art interactive educational computer  technology to demonstrate how
              probability shapes nature.  It  will draw its examples from a variety of
              scientific fields  including physics, chemistry, earth sciences, and biology. 
              It  is planned as a permanent addition to the Museum's exhibition  program, but
              will be designed to facilitate easy reproduction  for individual copies or for
              circulation as a travelling  exhibit.  Millions of visitors--families,
              teachers, children  form diverse communities--will gain a first hand aesthetic 
              appreciation of the pattern finding process of scientific  investigation as
              well as a better understanding of the  usefulness of mathematics in explaining
              how the natural world  works.  ***
