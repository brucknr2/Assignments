Abstract    :
              9353307  Bradley    Under the leadership of Rebuild Los Angeles (RLA) and the
              Los  Angeles School District, the self study/planning process will  involve
              data collection, program and policy review, and the  development of a proposal
              that will identify systemic approaches to  improve mathematics and science
              achievement for all students.     Key stakeholders, forming an Advisory
              Committee and a Steering  Committee, will assist the project director with data
              collection,  data analysis and intervention design. Study teams will assess 
              teacher quality, current status of reform measures and adequacy of  resources.
              Focus groups, consisting of representatives from  different socio-economic
              groups and ethnic backgrounds, will be  involved in the planning process.  ***
