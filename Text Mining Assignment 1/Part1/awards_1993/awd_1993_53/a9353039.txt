Abstract    :
              9353039  Sturgeon    The Satellite Educational Resources Consortium (SERC) is
              the  developing and implementing a multifaceted series of interactive  student
              resources and teacher material for middle school  mathematics classes.  They
              are designed for use in either the  second semester of seventh grade or the
              first semester of eighth  grade.  The integrated package includes video
              programs (108 in  number, each twenty minutes in length), on-going small-=group
               telephone conferences, and on-line computer networking for  teachers. 
              Emphasis is placed on problem solving and the materials  anchored in real world
              situations.  The units are built around  interdisciplinary topics which include
              sailing, the music industry,  architecture and sports, the airline industry,
              math in motion,  oceans and atmosphere, medicine and health, photography, and
              the  natural world.  Each unit includes an exploration from among the 
              following mathematical areas:  patterns and functions; computation  and
              estimation; algebra; statistics; probability; geometry; and  measurement.
