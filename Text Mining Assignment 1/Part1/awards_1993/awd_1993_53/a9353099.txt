Abstract    :
              9353099  Anderson    The project is a three year investigation of collaborative
              problem  solving in science for the purpose of developing accounts of  learning
              and problem solving by middle school students and  developing instructional
              strategies and materials that improve both  students' conceptual understanding
              of science and their capacities  for self-regulation in complex problem solving
              situations.  Year 1  is an intervention study investigating the comparative
              effects of  three instructional conditions:  a) mediated independent problem 
              solving, b) group problem solving, and c) mediated group problem  solving. 
              This investigation will be conducted in eight classrooms  as the students study
              a unit on the nature and properties of  matter.  Analyses of Year 1 data will
              occur in Year 2 for the  purpose of:  a) evaluating the success with which the
              desired  outcomes were achieved across the various conditions in terms of 
              conceptual understanding, self-regulatory abilities, and  internalization of
              the social norms practiced across the three  conditions, b) evaluating the
              reasons for the outcomes, principally  through microanalysis of classroom
              interactions, and c) revising  the instructional procedures.  In Year 3, we
              will investigate the  implementation of the revised instructional program in
              eight  classrooms.  The proposed study will contribute both to research on 
              problem solving and conceptual understanding in science and to the  improvement
              of educational practice, focusing on the opportunities  for teachers and
              students to work together in "learning  communities."  ***
