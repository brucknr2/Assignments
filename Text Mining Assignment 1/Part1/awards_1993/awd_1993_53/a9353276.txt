Abstract    :
              HRD-9353276  Ratcliffe, Alphonso  San Francisco State University    The
              California State University Alliance for Minority Participation  (CSUAMP) will
              implement a comprehensive statewide, community  oriented program to
              significantly increase the number of minority  students who receive a
              baccalaureate degree in science,  engineering, and mathematics (SEM) fields of
              study.  By the end of  the grant period, the CSUAMP will increase the number of
              minority  students graduating with baccalaureate degrees in SEM fields from 
              750 to at least 1,500.  To accomplish this goal, the project will  involve
              underrepresented minority students in SEM enrichment  activities throughout
              their entire undergraduate careers.  This  alliance is a partnership among 16
              CSU campuses, 16 community  college campuses, and 12 major corporations. 
              Program activities  will focus on the transitions from high school to college,
              from a  two-year college to a four-year university, and from undergraduate  to
              graduate school.  There are three major sequential components of  project
              activities; summer bridge programs, academic year  workshops, and research
              internships.  Freshmen and sophomore  activities will concentrate on enriched
              mathematics, science, and  engineering courses; junior and senior year
              activities will be  devoted to paid research internships in SEM laboratories. 
              A  statewide Governing Board, composed of key leaders in higher  education and
              the private sector, will provide advice and counsel  to this project.  Finally,
              the project will work very closely with  two funded established AMP projects in
              Texas and California.
