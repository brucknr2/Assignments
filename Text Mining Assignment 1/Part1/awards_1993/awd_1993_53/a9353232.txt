Abstract    :
              9353232  Hall    This planning grant will aid Delaware in writing a teacher 
              enhancement proposal to address their middle school science needs.   A process
              has been described that includes Delaware's SSI project;  outside consultants,
              and Middle school teachers in defining the  needs and direction for middle
              school science.  Specifically,  meetings will be held, survey tools will be
              developed to evaluate  the current status of science in middle schools, and
              teachers will  hold community meetings to explain the need for science
              education  reform and obtain input on the proposed direction for middle school 
              science.    The planning grant will involve at least 30 middle school science 
              teachers.  The project duration is 12 months beginning June 1993  and ending
              June 1994.  There is no cost share for this project.
