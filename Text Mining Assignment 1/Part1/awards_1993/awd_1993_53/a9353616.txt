Abstract    :
                   NCES is conducting the second cycle of the National Study of              
              Postsecondary Faculty.  The first cycle was conducted in 1988.  The            
              study will provide a national profile of faculty in 4-year                     
              (doctoral-granting and other 4-year) and 2-year higher education               
              institutions.  Information on the backgrounds, responsibilities,               
              workloads, salaries, benefits, and attitudes of both full- and                 
              part-time instructional and noninstructional faculty in their many             
              and varied higher education institutions will be ascertained.                  
              Because faculty directly affect the quality of education in                    
              colleges and universities and perform much of the research and                 
              development work upon which the nation's technological and economic            
              advancement depends, it is essential to understand who they are,               
              what they do, and whether, how, and why they are changing.
