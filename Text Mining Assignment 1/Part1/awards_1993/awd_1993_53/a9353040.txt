Abstract    :
              9353040  Matthews    This project proposes to develop, introduce, evaluate and
              promote  Fast Wasps as a versatile new living organism for life science 
              instruction.  The project intends to involve teachers in developing  a minimum
              of ten (10) Fast Wasp laboratory investigations or  activities and three (3)
              professionally produced video tapes that  will supplement the instructional
              activities.  The project intends  to demonstrate how a research scientist can
              serve as a model for  other research scientists in improving pre-college
              science  education.  This will be done by helping teachers develop  meaningful
              laboratory activities that meets the needs of their  classes.  This is a
              cooperative project with seven (7) Georgia  school districts who will test and
              evaluate the materials.
