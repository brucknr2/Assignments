Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Building Mathematical Base for Environmental Studies                           
              Curricula                                                                      
                                                                                             
              This a planning project to develop a proposal for a State-                     
              wide program to enable mathematics teachers to help initiate                   
              and support environmental studies programs in grades 6-12.                     
              More specifically, the purposes of the planning study are:                     
              (1) to establish data bases of already existing projects and                   
              activities that integrate mathematics with environmental                       
              studies; (2) to organize a 3-day conference to pool                            
              experience and ideas from people already active in this                        
              field; and (3) to create a network of interested teachers                      
              and educators.  Since environmental problems are inherently                    
              global in nature, an international component is included--                     
              specifically cooperation with two specialized science                          
              schools in Russia.  The proper role of technology and                          
              computer software in such programs will be explored.
