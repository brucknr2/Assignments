Abstract    :
              9353895  Salah    Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) seeks to initiate
              a  three-week summer, commuter, Young Scholars program with extensive 
              follow-up activities during the academic year for 48 students  entering grades
              8 and 9. The students will engage in classroom  discussions, group activities,
              research projects, and field trips  from three different disciplines:
              astronomy, physics, and  mathematics. The program activities will apply physics
              and  mathematics to experimental observations and studies of  astronomical
              sources of radio emission; measurements of distances,  velocities and vectors,
              analysis of plate motion data and studies  of earthquakes; and investigations
              of the earth's atmosphere, its  variations and human effects on the
              environment. Each student will  have an opportunity to work with a scientist or
              mathematician who  will serve as a mentor.
