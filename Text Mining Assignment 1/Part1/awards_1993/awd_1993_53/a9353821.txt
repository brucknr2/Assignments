Abstract    :
              9353821  Elliot       The selection of a science/mathematics/engineering major,
              and  persistence to a degree in that course of study, will be examined  in the
              entire cohort of 5320 students entering Dartmouth, Brown,  Yale, and Cornell
              college programs in 1988.  In the statistical  analysis of the cohort,
              particular attention to a number of factors  antecedent to college admission
              and present during the college  experience.  Among those selecting scientific
              fields (1625), there  will also be a deeper investigation on an almost
              case-by-case  basis, through questionnaires and interviews, of background, 
              motivation, college experience, institutional factors, career  aspiration, and
              the like, among minority students, both those who  persisted in their course
              and those who did not.
