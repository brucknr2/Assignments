Abstract    :
              9353869  Reibstein    The University of Pennsylvania seeks to initiate a 4-week,
              summer  residential and commuter, Young Scholars program in Biology and 
              Mathematics for 79 students entering grades 10 and 11. The Program  involves
              the biology students in laboratory projects guided by  faculty, and in lectures
              and discussions on enzymes, molecular  genetics, and neurochemistry.
              Mathematics students explore areas of  research including number theory,
              geometric optimization, chaos,  and statistics. All students have a computer
              laboratory experience  and all will engage in follow-up activities during the
              academic  year.
