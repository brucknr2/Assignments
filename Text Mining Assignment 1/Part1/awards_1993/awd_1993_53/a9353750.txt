Abstract    :
              9353750  Roberts  This is a project to lay the groundwork for developing a
              program to provide two-year post-doctoral and sabbatical fellowships to
              research mathematicians and computer scientists to work on problems of
              pre-college mathematics education.  These fellows will continue their regular
              research programs, while devoting 50% of their time to educational matters. 
              The present project is a one-year pilot project to lay the groundwork for the
              larger scale 5-year program (to begin in 1994/95).   Funds are requested for a
              one-year fellowship for one research mathemetician with a prior track record of
              work in education, whose job will be to marshall and organize the educational
              resources at Rutgers and elsewhere, with a view to making possible
              collaborative efforts with future fellows.
