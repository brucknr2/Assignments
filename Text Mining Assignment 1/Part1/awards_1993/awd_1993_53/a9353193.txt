Abstract    :
              9353193 Lamb The purpose of this proposal is to expand and enhance the research
              capabilities in the Department of Chemistry through the use of nuclear magnetic
              resonance (NMR) technology.  A superconducting, multinuclear, 300 MHz NMR
              instrument with two-dimensional, variable temperature, and solid-state
              capabilities is requested and will provide a base for long-term cooperative
              research with Greensboro Consortium Institutes (Bennett College, Guilford
              College, and University of North Carolina at Greensboro) and industries in the
              Greensboro area.  The 300 MHz NMR will be an integral research instrument for
              determining structural elucidation and structural conformation of synthetic
              organic molecules, synthetic ligands, organometallic complexes (hemocyanin
              models and molybdenum complexes), and protein (phospholipases).  Kinetic
              studies of molybdenum complex formation, keto-enol equilibria and the catalytic
              activity of the human placental phospholipase A2 isoenzyme will also be
              conducted. ***
