              This project is for partial support of a conference of                         
              physics Department Chairs to be held in Washington DC in May                   
              1993.  The conference will bring together a large number of                    
              chairs, and it will allow planning and coordination of both                    
              the research and education roles of physics departments in                     
              all kinds of institutions.  It will address issues of                          
              undergraduate and graduate students and of faculty, of the                     
              role of the physics department in research, with future                        
              teachers, and with underrepresented groups.
