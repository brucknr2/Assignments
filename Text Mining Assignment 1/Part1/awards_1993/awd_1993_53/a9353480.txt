Abstract    :
              9353480  Jasperson    "Atmospheric Explorations:  Participatory, Computer-Based 
              Simulations of the Weather" is a collaborative project of Augsburg  College and
              the Science Museum of Minnesota.  The purpose of the  project is to enhance the
              interest and skills of museum visitors  and students in science by providing a
              highly interactive exhibit  environmental that allows the users considerable
              freedom in  exploring topics in meteorology relevant to their everydays lives. 
               The exhibits will be designed to accommodate a gender- and  racially-diverse
              audience of national scope.  ***
