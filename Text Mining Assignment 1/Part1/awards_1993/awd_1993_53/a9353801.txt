Abstract    :
                  9353801  Graham         "Integrating a Multi-Interface, Multi-Access Online
              Communications And Information System" ,  submitted under the program for Small
              Grants for Experimental Research (SGER),  is a project which  attempts to
              provide a mechanism to incorporate a client-server conferencing capability to
              Internet  interfacing software for the science and mathematics education
              community.  To accomplish this task, it  is necessary to perform research and
              experimentation on several graphical client-servers and to  investigate methods
              of integrating the software across the DOS, Windows, and Macintosh platforms.  
              The  major outcome of this project will be a body of research which software
              developers can refer to  in their attempts to build effective Internet
              conferencing tools.      ***
