Abstract    :
              9353922  Mastascusa  Two week-long workshops are being offered for 40
              engineering  and science faculty on the use of PC-based engineering 
              workstations. Participants develop experiments and class  material using
              PC-based workstations, GPIB instruments, and  multimedia authoring systems.
              Workshop participants will join  a network of faculty interested in course and
              laboratory  development, and the workshop staff will encourage and assist  in
              having results presented at engineering education  conferences.  ***
