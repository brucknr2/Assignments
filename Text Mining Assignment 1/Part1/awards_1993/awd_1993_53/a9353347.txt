Abstract    :
              9353347  Hessler    This project will provide an intensive 3-week inservice, 
              residential summer institute for Vermont middle level and ninth and  tenth
              grade teachers.  The content focus is on activity-based  aquatic ecology as a
              vehicle for developing and teaching a model of  integrative mathematics,
              science and technology to teachers and  students.  Thirty different teachers
              will come to the Saint  Michael's campus each summer for three summers
              beginning in 1994.   Each of the 90 teaches will commit to restructuring
              curricula in  their schools to support their teaching of integrated aquatic 
              ecology content to their students for at least three years  following their
              Summer Institute and to learn development within  their schools.  Schools will
              be linked by modem and Vermont Ed-Net  telecomputing to one another and to the
              campus, for data-sharing.   Emphasis will be on the interpretation of data
              generated by  collecting from points along each river and subsequent analyses. 
               Data collected by Rivers Project schools will be shared with local,  state and
              federal agencies.    This proposal is appropriate for teacher enhancement
              because it is  designed to prepare teams of Leader Teachers who will work with 
              colleagues to being interdisciplinary science to middle school  students
              through an integrative local rivers science project.  It  also meshes will with
              the initiatives of the Vermont Statewide  Systemic Initiatives grant from NSF
              which is designed to teach  integrative science, math, and technology.   
              Non-NSF cost-sharing is approximately 22% of the amount requested  from NSF.
