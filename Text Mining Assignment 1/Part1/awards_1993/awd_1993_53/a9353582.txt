Abstract    :
              9353582  Lee    As students progress through the educational pipeline from 
              elementary and high school, into college and graduate school, the 
              proportionate representation of females interested in studying  science or
              pursuing it as a career declines sharply.  While it is  reasonable that the
              group who persists in science becomes  increasingly selective academically at
              points further along the  pipeline, the fact that this "select" group contains
              so few young  women is more difficult to explain.  The study aims to develop an
               educational (rather than an individual choice) explanation for this 
              phenomenon.  Using data from the current, large, and nationally  representative
              National Educational Longitudinal Study of 1988  (NELS:88), preliminary
              investigation reveals a gender advantage in  science achievement for 8th grade
              boys.  More important, the  largest gender differences in science achievement
              are for students  of the highest ability. Since future women scientist are
              likely to  be drawn from this pool, these findings suggest a possible cause of 
              the underrepresentation of women in scientific careers.  The  study's major
              focus is on students' school and classroom  experiences in science as they move
              through the pipeline.  Using  the first three waves of NELS:88 data, the study
              aims to capture  the educational trajectory of the same students in their 8th,
              10th,  and 12th grade years.  The focus is on the opportunities schools 
              provide students to learn science, and how these opportunities  differ by
              gender-- espcecially for the ablest students.  ***
