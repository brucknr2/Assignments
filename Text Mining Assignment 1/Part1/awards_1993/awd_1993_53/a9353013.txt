Abstract    :
              9353013  Opliger    The Ohio State University Agricultural Technical Institute
              will  initiate a three week, residential Young Scholars project in 
              agricultural sciences for 36 students entering the 8th and 9th  grades.  This
              highly interactive program stresses group work and  collaboration in math and
              science under the general focus of  agricultural science.  Project activities
              include laboratory and  field experiences with practicing scientists serving as
              mentors.  Career exploration and ethics of science activities are also 
              provided.  High school teachers serve as mentors for follow up  science
              projects.  ***
