Abstract    :
                  ESI 9353362    PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR:  Dr. Alan Berkowitz    INSTITUTION:  
                 This two year project called SYEFEST: Schoolyard Ecology for  Elementary
              Science Teachers, a teacher enhancement effort that  focuses on outdoor biology
              instruction. It is sponored by the New  York Botanical Garden Inst and the
              Institute of Ecosystem Studies  The goals of the project are to develop outdoor
              ecological  activities, develop and pilot test a professional development 
              system for training teachers to use the activities, and to  evaluate the
              activities and training system. Fifteen teams (one  teacher and one ecologist
              per team) from around the country will  develop activities appropriate for
              their setting (urban/suburban/  rural) and climate. These teams will also serve
              as SYEFEST  trainers for approximately 10 teachers at each site. The 
              Ecological Society of America will disseminate the model and  manuals. Some of
              the materials which will be used may include   Feinsinger and review of OBIS.
              Some materials also may come from  EcoInquiry. The project will begin in 1994
              and continue through  1995.  The project matches 13% of the support from the 
              Foundation.
