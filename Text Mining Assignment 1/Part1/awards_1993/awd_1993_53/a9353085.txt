Abstract    :
              9353085  Seymour  The study is designed to identify and examine personal and 
              environmental factors that have supported or discouraged students  with
              Disabilities in entering academic programs and careers in  science,
              mathematics, engineering, and computer science.  The  investigation seeks to
              determine why the University of Minnesota's  Institute os Technology has been
              particularly successful in the  recruitment, retention, and placement of its
              students with  disabilities in these disciplines and careers.  Efforts will be 
              made to distinguish between the factors that originate within the  community
              and those that derive from the structure and culture of  the Institute or
              University.  The method of inquiry is based on  ethnographic techniques.  The
              study will draw on the cumulative  experience, reflections, and recommendations
              of students and former  students with disabilities  who have enrolled in the
              Institute.   Fifty juniors and seniors enrolled as full-time students in 
              science, mathematics, engineering, or computer science will be  invited to
              participate in focus group discussions.  An additional  20 recent graduates of
              the institute who have disabilities now  successfully employed in their
              careers, will be interviewed.   Verbatim transcripts will be entered into a
              computer program  designed to assist in identifying recurrent themes which 
              subsequently will be used in building a system of domains and  hypotheses.  The
              researcher will then develop a set of prioritized  recommendations concerning
              actions that can be taken by 4-year  institutions, pre-college educational
              systems, employers, and other  community-based entities to encourage people
              with disabilities to  enter these disciplines and careers.  ***
