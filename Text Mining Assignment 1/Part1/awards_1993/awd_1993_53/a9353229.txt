Abstract    :
                   SACNAS, the Society for Advancement of Chicanos and Native                
              Americans in Science, will hold it's annual Conference January 14-             
              18, 1993 in Albuquerque, New Mexico.  The objective of the                     
              conference is to encourage undergraduate science students to enter             
              graduate school in order to obtain the Ph.D. degree necessary for              
              careers in research and science education.  The Symposia will                  
              describe the exciting opportunities in Math, Engineering and                   
              Biology and provide strong role models for these fields.  The                  
              conference will contain workshops, panel discussions and organized             
              small group discussions designed to provide students with career               
              counseling as well as information on research opportunities.                   
              Undergraduate students will have ample opportunity to interact with            
              faculty of their own ethnic and racial background; in addition,                
              there will be one graduate student mentor for every four                       
              undergraduate students.  The conference will have a "Community                 
              Science Lecture", a science presentation that is aimed not only at             
              all the conference participants, but also at the local scientific              
              and lay community.  An outreach effort to local high school                    
              teachers and students is planned as part of the conference on                  
              Friday January 15.  The exhibitors associated with the conferences             
              will be graduate schools of science, and federal agencies and                  
              corporations that offer research careers.  The many aspects of the             
              conference are evaluated for effectiveness leading to continual                
              improvements that are partially responsible for the phenomenal                 
              increase in attendance that these Conferences have had in the last             
              three years.  A summary of the conference proceedings are published            
              and widely disseminated through the SACNAS Newsletter and other                
              national publications.
