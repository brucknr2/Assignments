Abstract    :
                      9353233  Gilbert, John    This is a project for an 18-month Geometry
              Institute for some 25  middle school teachers in the Austin area.  The project
              is staffed  in part by 9 Austin area high school mathematics teachers who 
              previously attended an NSF-supported Regional Geometry Institute  (RGI) in
              Utah.  The 25 teachers are drawn from middle schools that  feed into high
              schools where the 9 RGI teachers currently teach.   The middle school teachers
              attend a 3-week summer program, as well  as regular Saturday follow-up meetings
              during the ensuing academic  year.  This program will enable the participating
              teachers to  strengthen the middle school geometry program, and give their 
              students a strong background for the innovative geometry they will  study later
              with the high school RGI teachers.  ***
