Abstract    :
              SSC-9353154  Jefferson County Public Schools  Louisville, KY    Harding, Howard 
                "Science With A Twist - Technology Education Attracting Minorities  (SWAT
              TEAM)"    The Jefferson County Public School (JCPS) District's SWAT TEAM is  a
              precollege project that focuses on developing African-American  middle-school
              students' interest in science and mathematics,  engineering and other careers
              requiring knowledge and skills in  science and mathematics.  The project also
              encourages the students  to enroll and achieve in science and mathematics
              during their  tenure in high school.    SWAT TEAM consists of three consecutive
              4-week, 5-day summer camps,  with school-year follow-up activities.  Extending
              over a three-year  period, each year the camps will enable 50 African-American
              middle  school students to participate in classroom and field learning 
              experiences.  The students will learn about environmental science  and
              structural design, biological science, aviation and aerospace  dynamics, and
              forensic science as it applies to criminal justice.  They will engage in the
              scientific methods of observation, data  collection and analyzation, and draw
              conclusions through the use of  non-hazardous performance events.  They will
              use microscopes and  computer technology, where appropriate, to complete
              hands-on  learning experiences.    Career exploration will be a part of each
              instructional activity.   Students will interact with African-American
              chemists, engineers,  pilots, etc. to explore careers the require science and 
              mathematics.    The success of the project will be based on the students'
              ability  to perform events using science and mathematics, their increased 
              interest in science and mathematics, their perceptions of their  learning
              experiences, and follow-up data showing the science and  mathematics classes
              taken by the students in high school.
