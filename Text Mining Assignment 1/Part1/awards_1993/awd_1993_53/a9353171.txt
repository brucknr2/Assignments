Abstract    :
              SSC-9353171  CUNY John Jay College  New York, NY    Christ, Lily and Green,
              Edward    "John Jay Summer Computer Camp"    The John Jay College Summer
              Computer Camp (JJSCC) is an  academically intensive five week summer program
              followed by an  academic year component with mathematics as the curricular
              focus.   This program is modeled after the highly successful NSF funded 
              TexPrep curriculum, with some modifications to suit the local  conditions.  The
              target population for JJSCC is students entering  grades 7-9 from selected
              schools in New York City.      The Program consists of: (1) a structured
              schedule from Mondays  through Thursdays during the summer including courses in
              computer  science, logic, probability and statistics, and problem solving;  and
              (2) informal field trips, hands-on project workshops, and SEM  career
              counseling on Fridays during the summer and six Saturdays  during the academic
              year.  Guest speakers serve as role models and  provide the participants with
              personalized exposure to the  multitude of career opportunities in the fields
              of science,  engineering, and mathematics (SEM).    The curriculum emphasizes
              the students' development of abstract  reasoning and problem solving skills. 
              All courses will be taught  by using "team-teaching" and "cooperative learning"
              techniques.   Students will be encouraged to work together and to utilize peer-
               tutoring by establishing "Academic Fraternities", a model  introduced by
              Treisman.  Computers and calculators will be an  integral part of the program. 
                The John Jay Summer Computer Camp will enroll 35 students in JJSCC  I (level
              1) the first year (June 28, - August 2, 1993); and 55  students in each of the
              second and third years, 30 for JJSCC I  (level 1) and 25 for JJSCC II (level
              2).
