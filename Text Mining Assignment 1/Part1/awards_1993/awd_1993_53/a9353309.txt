Abstract    :
              9353309 Henry The establishment of a multi-user, transmission electron
              microscope facility is requested for the departments of biology, chemistry and
              physics.  The electron microscope facility will replace a dated instrument of
              twenty years and will enhance the current research efforts in the
              structure/budding of pathogenic spordia and the microstructural
              characterization of superconducting materials.  The mutant spordia infects
              barley, which has an important nutritional value for humans and animals, and
              also is reputedly an opportunistic agent in human AIDS.  For the
              superconducting materials, the electron microscope will be used to characterize
              at the micron regime superconductive materials whose electronic properties are
              affected by the substructure during processing. ***
