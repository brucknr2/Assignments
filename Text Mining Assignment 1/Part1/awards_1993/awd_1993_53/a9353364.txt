Abstract    :
              9353364  Odom    This is a four-year project designed to present staggered
              3-year  programs of mathematics content, pedagogy, and assessment for all  the
              elementary school teachers, K-6, and school administrators in  the 122
              buildings in Montgomery County, Maryland.  Teachers will be  involved in up to
              60 hours of preparation in content modules, which  include extensive attention
              to how children learn that content.   School administrators and teachers of
              special subjects are involved  with focused activities for improving student
              performance in  mathematics from their perspectives.  The school building is
              the unit of administration in this program.   All faculty and administration in
              the building will be involved in  the project simultaneously.  An additional 30
              hours of activities  is planned to be used by the entire faculty at the school
              site  based on their needs assessment following the content component.   The
              project materials are based on a broad base of materials from  the mathematics
              reform and the research base being developed  through another NSF-funded
              project:  Project IMPACT carried out in  the district.  Project staff and
              district leaders will be available  to teachers and administrators through the
              full 3-year cycle for  each school.  These individuals are in the district, and
              they have  assignments which allow involvement in the activities and a 
              availability for site support.  Additional support is being  developed through
              area colleges and universities which are planning  to offer extended offerings
              for teachers and use the program as a  model for the preservice education.  
              The district will be able to monitor student performance on several  measures
              used in the district including standardized testing, state  testing, and
              district assessment programs which are being developed  to include performance
              based activities.  In addition, the project  will monitor teacher and
              administrator changes through participant  surveys and classroom observations.
