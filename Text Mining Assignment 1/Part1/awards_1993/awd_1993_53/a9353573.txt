Abstract    :
              9353573  Fuson    The research will focus on cultural and social contexts of
              urban  Latino children's mathematics learning.  It will trace multiple  paths
              of children's construction of addition, subtraction, place  value, and problem
              solving understanding within primary school  classrooms that contain social,
              material, linguistic, and cultural  supports for such construction.  Teaching
              studies will be carried  out in cooperation with teachers of English-speaking
              and Spanish-  speaking classrooms to discover culturally relevant conceptual
              and  social supports that facilitate children's mathematical thinking in  the
              specified areas.  The project will also focus on ways to invole  low-literacy
              parents of poor urban Latino children in supporting  their children's
              mathematical thinking at home and in school.  The  results will involve
              developing theories in four areas:  tenstructured methods of single-digit
              addition and subtraction like  those used so effectively by Asian children,
              multidigit and place-  value thinking, word problem solving, and classroom
              conceptual  supports for children's mathematical thinking.  The resulting 
              improved theories, as well as the descriptions and analyses of  individual
              children's learning, will provide a basis for large-  scale teacher development
              and school change activities in urban  schools.  The results will also
              contribute to our understanding of  all children's thinking in these
              mathematical areas.  ***
