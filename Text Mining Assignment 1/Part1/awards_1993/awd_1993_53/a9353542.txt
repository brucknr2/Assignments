Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The New York Hall of Science requests a grant over three years                 
              to develop a non-urban program and 18 first generation                         
              replications across the country of our teacher training and                    
              equipment rental astronomy program, STARLAB.  The project                      
              builds on STARLAB's proven success here in New York and in                     
              urban sites trained through our collaboration with the                         
              Lawrence Hall of Science.  The target audience include                         
              traditionally underrespresented, ethnically and economically                   
              diverse groups.  In modelling and initiating the first round                   
              of replications in non-urban settings nationwide, the program                  
              recognizes the needs of a majority of the nation's school                      
              children whose education takes place outside of our urban                      
              centers.
