Abstract    :
              9353481  Soloway    At the heart of a working science literacy is the ability to
              create  models that explain real-world phenomena.  However, constructing, 
              simulating, and validating models poses a serious challenge for  students. 
              Just as professional computational scientists rely on  technology in their
              model creation activities, we propose  developing a Computation-Enhanced
              Science Learning (CESL)  educational approach that provides comparable
              technological support  for students and teachers.    ScienceWorks, the
              technological component of CESL, will provide  scaffolded, computational
              modeling tools that enable students to  create computational models; this
              activity should lead to a deep  understanding of the science phenomena.  The
              disposition to then  see scientific phenomena as analyzable systems should also
              develop  as students gain expertise over successive investigations.  
              ScienceWorks will afford students access to a broad range of  functionality,
              e.g., video simulations, data visualization  representations; the actual
              computations will be carried out by  off-the-shelf, professional software
              mediated through ScienceWorks'  open architecture.    CESL/ScienceWorks will be
              used on a daily basis at a public high  school; additionally, an informal
              network of ScienceWorks-using  schools will be supported over the Internet.  A
              longitudinal  assessment will be conducted to determine the impact that 
              CESL/ScienceWorks has on student's learning of science content and  science
              process; transfer ability will also be assessed.  Findings  from this effort
              should provide guidelines for the development of  next-generation,
              educationally-sensitive software.  ***
