Abstract    :
              9353970  Winfrey  This project involves an intensive two and one-half week 
              laboratory workshop in molecular biology for undergraduate  faculty. The
              workshop allows 20 participant faculty per year to  learn the basic principles,
              techniques and applications of  modern molecular biology. Consideration is
              given to faculty in  need of re-training or those who teach women and
              minorities.  The principal goal of the workshop is to provide participants 
              with hands-on techniques, experiences, and educational  materials to implement
              effective undergraduate molecular  biology laboratory instruction into their
              curriculum.   Participants isolate and separate DNA, clone genes, and analyze 
              the cloned genes by Southern blotting, nucleic acid  hybridization, the
              polymerase chain reaction (PCR), DNA  sequencing, and computer assisted
              sequence analysis. Also,  laboratories are supplemented with lectures on the
              principles  of methods used and by seminars presented by experts from  academia
              and industry on various applications of molecular  biology. Sustained
              interaction among the participants will be  maintained by networking and
              holding follow-up workshops and a  mini-symposium after completion of the
              original two and one-  half week workshop course.   ***
