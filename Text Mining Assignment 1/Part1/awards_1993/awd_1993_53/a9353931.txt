Abstract    :
              9353931  Thomas  This project offers four training workshops, over a two year 
              period, designed to teach the basic skills needed to create  multimedia
              courseware.  Workshops will be offered by the  Engineering multimedia Research
              Laboratory (EMRL) at Cornell  University.  The use of electronic multimedia
              courseware in  teaching undergraduate engineering is worthwhile for both 
              students and instructors. However, instructors often perceive  the time needed
              to create courseware modules as too great.   This project intends to change
              this perception.  Pedological,  content, and technical issues will be addressed
              and to simplify  the authoring process, the EMRL will create templates and 
              utilities for use by the participants.  Follow-up support will  be available
              over the Internet, and an archive of the  courseware modules created during the
              workshops will maintained  by the EMRL.  ***
