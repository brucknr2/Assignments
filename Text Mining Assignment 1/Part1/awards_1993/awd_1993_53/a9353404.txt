Abstract    :
              9353404  Williams    This phase of Project LASE provides a series of four 5-day 
              workshops during the summer of 1994 and again in 1995.   During the summer of
              1994 the sites would be at universities  on the West Coast.  In 1995 the
              four-sites would form a  cluster in the southeastern, midwestern or
              northeastern  United States.    At each site the first of two 5-day workshops
              will be led by  the author (LASE Project PI); the second, to give "local 
              ownership", will be led by a local Consultant.  The  workshops will cover laser
              surveying, beam scanning,  refractive index measurements, lenses, pattern
              recognition,  photodetectors, modulating beams, guiding lights with  fibers,
              absorption and reflecting, polarization and liquid  crystals, interference,
              diffraction, and holography.   Mathematics will be integrated into all
              activities.  At each  workshop twelve secondary school teachers will be trained
              to  present these topics, to other teachers,and as lab exercise  in their
              classrooms with opportunities for their students to  experiment further and
              publish their "findings" in the  project journal LASE LOG.  The Consultants
              will assist and  observe at the first meeting, but be in charge at the  second.
