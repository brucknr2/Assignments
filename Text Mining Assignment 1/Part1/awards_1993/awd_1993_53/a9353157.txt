              Julius    Southwest Texas State University conducts the "Hands-on Aquatics 
              Summer Science Camp" for fifty seventh grade Black and Hispanic  students from
              rural central Texas annually.  The project emphasizes  the interdisciplinary
              relationships among biology, chemistry,  physics, geology, mathematics and
              computer science through  carefully selected field and laboratory experiments
              and  observations focusing on the fresh-water environment in the  nationally
              acclaimed San Marcos River.  The project includes career  counseling, daily
              role model interaction with Black and Hispanic  students, faculty, and
              practicing scientists, and hands-on research  experience.
