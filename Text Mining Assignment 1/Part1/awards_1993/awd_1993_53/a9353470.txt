Abstract    :
              9353470  Bordeaux    Sinte Gleska University proposes to develop leadership
              teams and  educate teachers to improve mathematics and science education for 
              over 1000 American Indian elementary students.  The three year  project
              coordinates with the State SSI, the SKILL (Scientific  Knowledge for Indian
              Learning and Leadership), Dakota BBS a small  Indian owned business and several
              local school districts.  No less  than 94 teachers and 21-24 administrators
              from at least 8 target  schools will participate in the project during the
              three years.  32  teachers (16 from grades K-4, 16 from grades 4-8) will enter
              the  project at the beginning of the first Summer Institute.  This group  will
              participate fully in the project at least until the end of the  second Summer
              Institute.  Teachers may attend the entire three  years of the project but in
              the third year they would be expected  to act as mentors and facilitators. 
              Mathematics and science  education courses will be offered for 6 hours of
              graduate credit.   An additional 2 graduate credits will be earned each summer
              through  education practicum 1.  Class members will develop integrated 
              culturally-relevant learning units, learn and practice leadership  skills,
              interact in small learning groups and with administrators  and conduct
              individual or group learning projects.  The entire  program will support
              integrated mathematics and science for  elementary students and will focus on
              both content and pedagogy.    At least two administrators from each target
              school are expected to  attend at least one Summer Institute for one week and
              to fully  participate in mathematics and science education improvement in 
              their school.  American Indian families including both children and  adults
              will participate in Family Math in-service programs.   Follow-up activities
              include:         *    monthly Saturday Seminars beginning in November and      
                   ending in May;         *    a project Bulletin Board System will provide
              peer support            for teachers, opportuni ties for collaborative         
                teacher/student project undertakings both among program            schools
              and nationally and world wide access to            information.         *   
              the Rural Development Telecommunications Network (RDTN),            a two way
              interactive TV network which links thirteen            strategic locations in
              the state via fiber-optic cable,            will be used to link project sites.
               No less than four 2-            hour teleconferences will be held each year.  
               Cost share on the project is 13%
