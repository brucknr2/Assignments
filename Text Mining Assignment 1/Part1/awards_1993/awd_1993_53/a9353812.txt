Abstract    :
              9353812  Wood    The University of California at Davis seeks to initiate a
              six-week,  residential, Young Scholars project in Biological and Environmental 
              Science for 40 students entering grades 10 and 11. The project  provides
              students an opportunity to become involved in individual  research activities
              in collaboration with university research  mentors. The students will
              participate in "hands-on" laboratory  activities designed to help them gain
              insight into the  interdisciplinary complex and interactions of biological
              concepts  and agricultural  sciences. Additional activities include field 
              trips and follow-up activities during the academic year.
