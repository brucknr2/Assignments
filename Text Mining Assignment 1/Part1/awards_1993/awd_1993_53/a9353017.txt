Abstract    :
              9353017  Marin      City College of New York (CUNY) seeks to provide enrichment 
              experiences for a six week commuter program in environmental  science for 50
              high-ability and high-potential ninth and tenth  grade students from the city
              of New York. During the six-week  period the students will work in teams of
              twenty-five and sub-  groups of five solving real-world environmental problems.
              They will  be assisted by environmental scientists and university professors.  
              Activities include seminars, field investigations, individual  career
              counseling, research project, and dialogue and visits with  various scientists.
              Follow-up activities during the academic year  will involve students using
              their summer experiences to develop  individual projects. The selected students
              will enter the project  as a special program within the Bronx High school of
              Science.  ***
