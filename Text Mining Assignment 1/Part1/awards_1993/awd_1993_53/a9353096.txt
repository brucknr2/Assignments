              9353096 Linn Benton Community College Carolyn K. Gardner, Principal Investigator
              "International Survey of Access Technologies"          &  ABSTRACT   Modern
              technology is enhancing the capabilities of students with disabilities to
              acquire higher education in all academic disciplines, but the importance of
              this technology is especially critical in science and mathematics.  The project
              consists of a broad review and comparison of present technologies and
              methodologies used in Europe and the U.S. to improve access to education by
              students with visual, hearing, motor, and learning disabilities.  Efforts will
              be made to identify uses of modern computer technology in various disciplines
              and the training approaches used to prepare students for the use of the
              technology.  The research will be conducted during a sabbatical from Linn
              Community College, and the results will be used in the formulation of a
              comprehensive program at Oregon State University for the training of students
              with disabilities in science, mathematics, and engineering.  Results will also
              be analyzed for publication in appropriate educational journals. ***
