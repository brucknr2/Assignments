Abstract    :
              9353952  Pauling  This three-year program sponsored by the California State 
              University Program for Education and Research in Biotechnology  (CSUPERB) is
              designed to promote updated, current instructions  in molecular life sciences
              and biotechnology at the  undergraduate level. The program will offer summer
              workshops in  molecular life sciences and biotechnology for community college 
              and comprehensive university faculty. There will be six  workshops in Molecular
              Biology for the Inexperienced at  California State University (CSU) campuses
              throughout  California (Bakersfield, Northridge, Sacramento, San Francisco, 
              San Marcos, and Sonoma), aimed primarily at faculty teaching  lower-division
              courses. Follow-up sessions will be coordinated  with the annual CSUPERB
              Symposium and Conference held at the  Cal-Poly Pomona campus. This coordinated
              approach will lead to  stronger liaisons between California Community College
              and CSU  faculty in the molecular life sciences, and to improved  instruction
              in the molecular life sciences at the lower  division levels.  ***
