Abstract    :
              9353945  Hubbard  SUNY College at Brockport in cooperation with the United
              States  Geological Survey (USGS) and the American Water Resources  Association
              (AWRA) will conduct a Water Science Workshop for  Science and Engineering
              Faculty and for Education Faculty who  direct the preparation of middle school
              and secondary science  teachers.  The purpose of the two-week workshop is (a)
              to  provide participants up-to-date learning in the science of  hydrology, (b)
              to make available learning materials such that  each participant leaves with a
              water science teaching kit which  emphasizes first-hand learning in hydrology,
              (c) to acquaint  participants with the instructional potential of materials and
               information available from the USGS-WRD including the  AWRA/Department of
              Interior Water Education Initiative, and (d)  to promote learning by
              pre-service teachers through  participant-conducted Water Resources Education
              Agent (WREA)  Workshops during the following Academic Year, with the  objective
              that pre-service teachers will multiply the effort by  themselves acting as
              WREAs.  A one-week follow-up workshop will  focus on evaluation, revision and
              further implementation of  WREA activities.  Presentation of the WREA
              experience and  educational materials and additional follow-up will take place 
              as part of the Thirty-First AWRA Conference in Houston in Fall  1995.  ***
