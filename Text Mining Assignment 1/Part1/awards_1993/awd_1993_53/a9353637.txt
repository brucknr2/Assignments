Abstract    :

              Angeles Unified School District  Los Angeles, CA    "Region C Partnership for
              Minority Achievement"    Los Angeles unified School District Administrative
              Region "C" has  a well established partnership with the School of Education at 
              California State University, Los Angeles.  The proposed project  will build
              upon that partnership and marshal the professional  expertise of the Science
              and Mathematics faculty, in the school of  Natural and Social Science and the
              School of Education, to expand  the capability of teachers in 40 targeted
              schools so that they can  more effectively meet the needs of African American
              and Latino  American pupils.  Currently the two groups of students that have 
              been targeted are averaging a 48% drop-out rate.  The Project will  serve a
              specific geographical area within Region C. It is designed  to improve science
              and mathematics instruction in elementary,  middle and senior high schools. 
              The Project will actively address  student interest, motivation to study, and
              excitement about and  involvement in science and math activities.  At the same
              time self-  concept issues related to the project will also focus on student 
              academics and college possibilities.    Project activities include in-school
              activities at the University,  and field work, plus visits to participating
              technological  organizations and industries.  The Project Staff has planned 
              intervention activities for students primarily in the 4th through  10th grades,
              their teachers, parents, and all school site  administrators in the targeted
              schools.  The direction is one of  systemic change of current practices;
              interventions that have been  shown through research to produce more African
              American and Latino  American students who take college preparatory courses and
              who  subsequently enter the sciences at the University will be used.    The
              PMSA Partnership Project is designed so that as desired  outcomes are
              associated with practices,  old, new or in combination,  the practices will be
              integrated into the culture and financial  fabric of the school in efforts to
              institutionalize strategy,  attitude and group behavior.  The project
              concentrates its services  on approximately 1500 elementary pupils, 600 middle
              and 300 senior  high students, but upward to 8000 students each year will
              receive  services.
