              the staff to explore the needs and specifications of a                         
              project which would give inteternet access to K-12 educators                   
              throughout West Virginia.  Building on work that has already                   
              been done, this planning grant includes an assessment of the                   
              teachers' needs, an evaluation of the network capacity, and                    
              the development of a strategy for full implementation in the                   
              form of a proposal.  Through the network, the teachers will                    
              be able to access vast databases in science and mathematics                    
              as well as mentors and other resources.
