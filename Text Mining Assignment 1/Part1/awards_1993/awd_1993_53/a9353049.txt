Abstract    :
              9353049  Johnson    St. Cloud State University will offer a 5-week        
              interdisciplinary, summer residential program for 30 ninth and  tenth grade
              students. Research experiences on water quality and  river life will use
              concepts and methods from chemistry, biology,  statistics and computer science.
               The impact of water quality on  river life will be investigated through short
              and long term  projects that are carried out with the assistance of SCSU
              faculty  mentors.  Ethics of science activities will include classroom, 
              laboratory and workshop discussions as well as mock town meetings  and computer
              simulations.  Career explorations will include field  trips to industrial sites
              and seminars/workshops on pre college  preparation.  Follow up activities will
              include seminars at  participants high schools, field trips and networking
              through  electronic mail.  ***
