Abstract    :
              Green City Data is an after-school community service project.   Teams of
              secondary students are trained to inventory urban natural  areas selected by
              regional resource planning agencies to supplement  their own data collection
              efforts.    Representatives from seven agencies and educational institutions 
              initiated this project to support development of a system of  greenspaces
              within the Portland, Oregon/Vancouver, Washington  metropolitan area.  This
              consortium includes expertise in resource  management, geography, biology,
              computer telecommunications,  science education and community coordination. 
              These and other  community professionals tech students and volunteer team
              leaders  (teachers or other adults) the basics of habitat identification and 
              mapping in the context of regional planning.  ***
