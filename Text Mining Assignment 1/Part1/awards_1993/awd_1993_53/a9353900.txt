Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  9353900  Stanley        Most instructional materials in classical
              science assume a strict cause and effect relationship.  More recent research in
              many disciplines demonstrates that macroscopic randomness leads to macroscopic
              patterns.  Examples, drawn from physics, chemistry, biology and earth science,
              include natural patterns in nerve cells, lightning, river deltas, tree
              branches, galaxy formation, ruggedness of coast lines and growth of materials -
              to name a few.  Each discipline-related workbook incorporates hands-on
              activities, prediction and hypothesizing activities, laboratory experiments,
              computer simulations, data analysis, modeling and assessment instruments which
              are based on previous work in research in teaching and learning.  The materials
              confront students' preconceptions while introducing important concepts
              underlying the study of patterns in nature.  Students learn to think like
              scientists.  Preliminary research demonstrates that this approach is
              particularly attractive to women, minority students and those who have not
              mastered the mathematical skills necessary to comprehend the traditional
              presentation of scientific concepts. The projects are designed to encourage
              students to work in cooperative groups and to encourage teachers to provide
              cognitive apprenticeships - modeling the student behavior, providing
              scaffolding as needed and fading as the students learn the skills.  Publication
