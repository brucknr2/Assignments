Abstract    :
              9353303  Jones    This award to the Memphis City Schools is for a self-study of 
              science and mathematics education in the city of Memphis.  It is  directed by a
              Strategic Planning Steering Committee that is broadly  representative of the
              community, educators, business, and policy  makers.  The self-study will begin
              with an examination of goals for  the city's science and mathematics programs
              leading to a statement  of those goals and a plan for their attainment.  The
              committee will  be staffed by research, mathematics, and science specialists
              from  the Memphis City Schools, with the Coordinator of Research Services  as
              the staff person in charge of the self-study.  Data collection  will include a
              variety of coordinated procedures, observations, new  data collection, and
              analysis of existing information among them.   A broad range of participants
              will be involved in goal  clarification, study design, measurement, analysis,
              and reporting  thereby insuring ownership and "buy-in" by a broadly
              representative  group of Memphians.  The results will be broadly disseminated
              using  the network of individuals and groups involved in the study itself.  
              The committee will continue to review the status of mathematics and  science
              education periodically and will issue reports on the state  of mathematics and
              science education in the City of Memphis.    The cost-sharing for the project
              will be 19 percent of the NSF  portion.  ***
