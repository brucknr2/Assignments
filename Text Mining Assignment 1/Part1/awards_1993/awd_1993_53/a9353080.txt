Abstract    :
              9353080  Leuth    Tarleton State University will initiate a 6 week residential,
              Young  Scholars project in earth science, life science, meteorology and 
              chemistry for thirty rural students entering the 9th and 10th  grades. 
              Activities and instruction are centered around a central  environmental science
              theme: non point source pollution in two  watersheds.  Scientific methodologies
              focus on pollution  identification and remediation.  The program provides
              classroom  instruction, lab/field exercises, seminars on ethics and forums on 
              career opportunities.  Students generate, synthesize and present  data in a
              final two day seminar for parents, peers and school  teachers.  In the follow
              up activities, students return to TSU for  re-sampling and analysis of waters
              and biologic materials.   ***
