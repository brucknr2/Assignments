Abstract    :
              9353189 Olbrot The proposed research will investigate robust control for systems
              with parametric uncertainty models.  The research will consider that the
              uncertain parameters belong to a known region of tolerances and will attack the
              problem of how to reduce this region based on a knowledge of noisy
              measurements.  New algorithms will be developed for testing robustness which
              can handle the reduced parameter uncertainty regions where nonlinear
              inequalities for the parameters will be an essential difficulty.  The
              determination of the reduced region of parameter uncertainty will facilitate
              the use of known robust control designs.  The investigation will develop
              extensions of two specific design methods for time-varying robust controllers,
              generalized hold functions and switching dead beat controllers and include the
              continuum of uncertain parameters and time delays. ***
