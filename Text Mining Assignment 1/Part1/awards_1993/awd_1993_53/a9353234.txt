              Houston school districts and key stakeholders, led by the Houston Independent
              School District, will perform a self study to determine the present state of
              mathematics and science education and prepare an implementation plan to reform
              the K 12 SMT education system.  The self study and the development of the
              implementation plan will be directed by a Governing Board (GB) consisting of
              the Mayor, superintendents of the participating districts and other key
              leaders.  The GB is responsible for implementing policy decisions and
              developing community awareness and support.  Data gathering and analysis, and
              obtaining community and other stakeholder input will be directed by a Steering
              Committee (SC) appointed by the GB.  The SC will include representatives of the
              school districts, government and other stakeholders.  The SC will carry out the
              self study using ad hoc subcommittees, paid consultants and information
              provided by various school district offices.  It will then develop policy
              recommendations and the implementation plan for consideration by the GB.
