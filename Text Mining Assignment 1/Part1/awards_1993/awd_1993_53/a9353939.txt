Abstract    :
              9353939  Vitz  Two six-day workshops for undergraduate general chemistry 
              teachers will introduce participants to the LlMSport program,  a cost-effective
              implementation of computer data acquisition  and reduction in the laboratory.
              LlMSport allows direct data  acquisition into a spreadsheet. Since standard
              hardware and  software (Lotus 1-2-3) are used, both the program and the 
              individual student experiments are easily shared. Faculty will  have hands-on
              experience with interfacing and an opportunity to  adapt laboratory experiments
              to the LlMSport format.  ***
