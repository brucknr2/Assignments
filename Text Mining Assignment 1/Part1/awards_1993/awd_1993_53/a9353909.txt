Abstract    :
              9353909  Carroll  The proposal is to run a molecular biology laboratory workshop
               for undergraduate faculty from institutions in the New York  Metropolitan area
              to provide them with tools needed to  implement laboratory techniques in
              molecular biology into their  courses. Twenty-five faculty members will attend
              a five-day  residential workshop at St. John's University.  Applications of 
              techniques and current breakthroughs using this technology will  also be
              discussed. Follow-up activities include an evening  Lecture Series during the
              academic year focusing on the impact  of molecular biological techniques on
              current knowledge in cell  and molecular biology. SJU faculty and invited
              speakers from  other Metropolitan area research institutions will present 
              these lectures. Informal discussions will follow the lecture,  facilitating
              networking among the participants, SJU faculty and  invited speakers. Time will
              be made available on those evenings  for consultation and discussion with SJU
              faculty concerning  implementation of laboratory exercises by undergraduate
              faculty  participants.  In addition, one session of the follow-up  activities
              will be devoted to informing participants of grants  opportunities that can
              help them obtain equipment to use the  molecular techniques in their courses.
