Abstract    :
              9353586  McPartland, MacIver, Jordan    This is a secondary analysis of the
              National Educational  Longitudinal Study of eight grad students beginning in
              1988 that  seeks to analyze forms of grouping and staffing that affect the 
              access to math and science learning opportunities.  The project  would make use
              of existing data from NELS:88 follow-up of 8th grade  students to the 12th
              grade to examine changes in selection of  courses and opportunities by
              minorities and women to better develop  models of the changes in science and
              math subjects in the schools  they attend. The project is expected to provide
              new knowledge of  how practical alternatives to tracking can increase female
              and  minority participation in mate and science careers.  ***
