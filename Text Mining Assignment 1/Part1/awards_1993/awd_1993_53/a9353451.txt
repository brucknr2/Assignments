Abstract    :
              9353451  Martin    This three-year project, the Weatherwatch Leadership Network,
              is  designed to increase and improve the teaching of weather in  selected
              Districts in New York City.  The target grade level is  elementary/middle
              school.  The project emphasizes the development  of teachers' capability to
              provide leadership to their peers,  develop appropriate curriculum materials
              and sue a newly developed  electronic linkage which will bring weather data,
              weather maps and  satellite cloud imagery directly into the classroom.   
              WeatherWatch will provide participants with a summer institute,  academic year
              support through biweekly workshops and on-site  demonstrations, access to a
              designated-space electronic bulletin  board and opportunities to exchange and
              present local weather  information, curriculum materials and classroom projects
              through  telecommunications, inservice courses and dissemination  conferences.
