Abstract    :
              9353874  Bozler    The University of California and the Southern California
              Student  Research Consortium will offer an academic year, multi-  disciplinary
              Young Scholars program to students entering grades  10 to 12.  This program
              places students under the supervision of  professional scientists at
              universities, museums or industrial  laboratories.  Student research culminates
              with a presentation at  the annual meeting of the Southern California Academy
              of Science.   Research techniques, ethics of science and opportunities for 
              scientific careers are explored in a series of Saturday meetings.  ***
