Abstract    :
              9353565  Sanford    The Magic School Bus Museum Collaborative, requests through 
              Discovery Places, Inc., NSF support for six science museums and  Scholastic
              Productions, Inc., to develop science education  materials that capitalize on
              the interest and excitement in the  forthcoming Magic School Bus television
              series and the Magic  School Bus books.  Over a three year period the
              collaborative  will provide basic science education activities and 
              demonstrations through museum educational programming.  The  collaborative will
              provide tools and support for teachers to use  the Magic School Bus themes in
              their science curriculum and  provide hands-on science classroom experiences
              using mobile  museum exhibits.  Working with the National Urban League, ASPIRA,
               the AAAS Black Church Project, and other youth serving  organizations, the
              collaborative will encourage multi-ethnic  participation in these museum
              programs.    The numbers of children and their families who will be reached by 
              the Magic School Bus Museum Collaborative are significant.  The  components of
              the project are a planetarium program (100 copies),  two 1200 square feet
              traveling exhibits, and activity and  programming guide, table-top exhibits and
              program, and 2 teacher  enhancement workshops.  Collectively, these components
              can reach  conservatively over 5 million museum visitors in the first year.  
              Coupled with the new television series, the Magic School Bus can  have a
              tremendous impact on the education of young people in the  sciences.  ***
