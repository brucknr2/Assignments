Abstract    :
              9353067  Johnson    Syracuse University seeks to initiate a 4-week, residential
              Young  Scholars project in interdisciplinary science and mathematics for  5-
              disadvantaged students entering grades 8 and 9.  The program  provides high
              ability and high potential middle school students  with early experiences in
              mathematical problem solving, laboratory  science, computer science, and
              research in a highly charged  environment.  the summer component combines
              course work with  extensive laboratory and research experience, and includes
              field  trips designed to increase students' interest and awareness of  research
              career paths.  Academic year follow-up activities includes  an extension of
              activities and research in which the students were  involved during the summer.
