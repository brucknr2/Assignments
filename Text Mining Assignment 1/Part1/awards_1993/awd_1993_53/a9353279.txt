Abstract    :
              SSC-9353279  Kennesaw State College  Marietta, GA    Lester, Army    "Summer
              Science Camp For Precollege Minorities in Science and Engineering"    The
              underrepresentation of African Americans, women and other minority groups in
              science,  engineering and math (SEM) is growing at an alarming rate.  While
              much effort is directed  toward this problem relative to inner city
              populations, the omission of rural and suburban  students excludes a valuable
              source of potential scientists, teachers and engineers.  This proposal  is
              designed of offer a four-week college/community operated summer science camp
              that will  foster the efforts of Kennesaw State College, local school systems
              and community organizations  to (1) help break the negative stigma of SEM
              related subjects; (2) help students develop the skills  and motivate them to do
              well in these courses; and (3) to provide less targeted students with 
              information on career opportunities in SEM.  Twenty-five 7th -9th grade
              students of suburban  Atlanta (Cobb County and Marietta City School Systems)
              will take part in this program.  Six  staff members and several volunteers will
              coordinate activities that include lectures and seminars,  guest speakers,
              laboratory studies, group research projects, career exploration, academic 
              enrichment and field trips.  Course work will cover a board range of SEM
              related courses, with  an emphasis on how such courses impact living organisms.
               Special emphasis will be placed on  the teaching of science as a process.  The
              science camp component will start on June 13, 1993  and end on July 9, 1993. 
              Tutoring and mentoring will continue throughout the academic year.   The
              effectiveness of this program will be determined by the students' attitudes and
              behaviors  toward science, success of the participants in science classes and
              science fairs, and major/career  selection in college.
