Abstract    :
              9353142  Blank       This project will continue to develop and analyze
              indicators  for mathematics and science education.  Particular emphasis will be
               placed on developing new indicators of Opportunity to Learn,  Teacher
              Professional Development, and Cities/urban education.   There will also be
              state-by-state analyses of the condition of  mathematics and science education
              and a special effort reviewing  curriculum frameworks in all states.
