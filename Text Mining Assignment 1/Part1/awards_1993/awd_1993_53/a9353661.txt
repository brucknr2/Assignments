Abstract    :
              93-53661    Powe  NSF-Experimental Systemic Initiative Supplemental Proposal 
              The Mississippi NSF-EPSCoR Project has completed its first year of the Advanced
              Development  Program.  The advanced program, designed with individual campus
              components interacting as  clusters in the broad areas of chemistry/materials
              science, is successfully addressing barriers to  research in the state by
              combining resources across institutional lines.  Collaboration among  faculty
              and students has resulted in more faculty and industry exchanges, has increased
              research  activity among the EPSCoR investigators, and has strengthened
              undergraduate and graduate  instruction in the departments housing the EPSCoR
              components.    This Experimental Systematic Initiative proposes to enhance the
              professional development of  faculty, student development at the undergraduate
              and graduate levels, education, and knowledge  transfer and interaction with
              industry.  It will provide funding to allow faculty and students the 
              opportunity to interact with experts in their areas of research through travel
              and through  seminars  and workshops with leading scientists.  The lack of
              opportunity for such activity has  been identified as one of the barriers to
              research in the state.  This proposal addresses three of  the objectives of the
              Mississippi Advanced Development EPSCoR Program:         (a)  to create a
              critical mass of scientists by implementing inter-institutional links;      
              (b)  to strengthen the scientific community by working with other ongoing
              programs            and by stimulating the human resource pool in the state to
              become actively             involved in the research and education process; and
                    (c)  to establish technology transfer to appropriate user groups by
              developing stronger             research links with other research communities
              and by creating mechanisms for             commercial linkages and support of
              university-based research.    The Mississippi EPSCoR initiative is designed to
              provide for the specific  needs of the students  and faculty of individual
              components within the program.  These activities target faculty who  will
              either travel to appropriate industries or participate in campus seminars
              conducted by invited  scientists and consultants.  They also target students
              involved in the EPSCoR research as well  as students at other universities in
              the state and region.  The seven enhancement designs are  summarized as
              follows:         -    Faculty interaction with corporations involved in related
              research in and            involvement in technical meetings on polymeric
              adhesion and composite            materials;       -    Faculty interaction
              with corporations and laboratories dealing in composite            fabrication
              and in short courses in stress analysis;       -    Faculty interaction with
              corporations and laboratories for knowledge exchange in           
              non-destructive evaluation (NDE), in development of numerical models simulating
                         NDE processes, and in analysis of ultrasonic signals; use of
              external consultants            with expertise in ultrasonic acoustic signal
              processing;       -    A three-day symposium and workshop for state and
              regional investigators and            students with leading scientists in
              state-of-the-art solution, solid state and micro-            imaging nuclear
              magnetic resonance experiments;       -    Faculty and student travel for
              professional conferences; planned conference on            computational
              chemistry with recognized speakers;       -    Undergraduate research
              opportunities for visiting students; research assistance for            new
              EPSCoR faculty with competence in physical chemistry of surfaces;       -    A
              series of ten seminars with invited scientists addressing spectroscopic        
                 interrogation of transient species in chemical and biological systems for
              faculty            and graduate students.
