Abstract    :
              9353023  Abernethy    Furman University will initiate a four-week summer
              residential  Young Scholars project in computer science for twenty-seven 
              students entering grades 11 and 12.  Topics such as neural  networks, image
              processing, algorithm complexity and shortest  network problems will be
              explored using lectures, videos,  bibliographic materials and laboratory work. 
              Program instructors  and undergraduate lab assistants will work with small
              groups of  research teams consisting of  four or five participants.students 
              will present their results at a closing day ceremony.  Ethics of  science will
              be observed using the case study method.  Career  activities will include field
              trips to local computing sites and   a "shadowing the professional" activity at
              local job sites.   Follow up activities including two one day conferences and 
              presentations by participants on their academic year research  activities
              conclude the program.  ***
