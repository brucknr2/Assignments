Abstract    :
              9353833  Chang    The Materials World Modules are a series of materials  science
              and technology kits designed to supplement existing  mathematics and science
              curricula in high schools.  The  modules close the gap between frontiers of
              research and  science in classrooms, providing open-ended experiences for  both
              students and teachers.  Nine modules cover basic  materials systems, materials
              and society, and materials  conservation and the environment.  The modules
              provide  students with hands-on experiences in design, synthesis, and 
              evaluation of materials.  The concepts of mathematics and  science are
              reinforced in the application of materials  science and technology to product
              development and  manufacturing.  Each modules includes a self-contained 
              experimental kit, teacher and student manuals, a video tape  showing how
              experiments are conducted - including safety  instructions - and a software
              package for data analysis and  further modeling of the experiment.  The
              products are  developed by professors in the Materials Research Center at 
              Northwestern working with educators and high school science,  mathematics and
              technology teachers.  A central electronic  databank on materials will be
              maintained at the Materials  Research Center.   ***
