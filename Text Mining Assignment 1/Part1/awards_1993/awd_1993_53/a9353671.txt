Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This planning grant provides the time and resources                            
              necessary for the staff of Eastern Oregon State College to                     
              research and develop a full grant.  The full proposal will                     
              deliver content and dissemination technology in ecology                        
              education to elementary school teachers.  The topic is                         
              central to the economy of the region and the technology                        
              necessary to deliver the project is already in place.  The                     
              planning process is carried out in collaboration with the                      
              Oregon State University Agricultural Program, the Blue                         
              Mountain Natural Resources Institute, the Oregon Department                    
              of Education, and the ED-NET.                                                  
                                                                                             
              The planning process includes an assessment of the needs, an                   
              inventory of current conditions, an examination of the                         
              necessary technologies, and a plan for dissemination.                          
              Through a mini-conference and periodic meetings, the full                      
              proposal will take shape.                                                      
                                                                                             
              The cost sharing for the planning grant is estimated at 44%
