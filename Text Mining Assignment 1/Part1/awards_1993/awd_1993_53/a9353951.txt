Abstract    :
              9353951  Preston  The East Tennessee College Mathematics Consortium is
              conducting  two five-day workshops to introduce mathematical modeling to 
              freshman and sophomore two and four-year college mathematics  faculty. The
              first workshop is calculus-based and the second  workshop is precalculus-based.
              Participants are expected to  develop and incorporate appropriate models into
              the calculus  and pre-calculus courses they teach during the year following 
              the workshop. Three follow-up sessions are being held after  each workshop to
              reinforce the modeling techniques studied  and strengthen participant
              communication. A project document  containing the models studied and developed
              is being produced  and distributed to all participants. Fifteen of the 
              participants in the first workshop serve as leaders for the  second workshop.
