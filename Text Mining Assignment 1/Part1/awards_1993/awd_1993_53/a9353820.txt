Abstract    :
              9353820  Goldsmith    In the proposed 12 month project, Education Development
              Center,  Inc.(EDC) will undertake a research project designed to investigate 
              the role of affect in the process of teacher development in  mathematics
              instruction.  The research will use a case study  methodology to investigate
              how it feels for teachers to undertake  to change their mathematics practice,
              and how teachers' affective  states influence the process itself.  Five or six
              teachers  participating in a newly beginning teacher intervention project at 
              EDC will serve as the subjects for the investigation.  The study  will use both
              interview protocols and observations of teachers in  their classrooms and in
              teacher inquiry groups to gather data.   Analysis will focus on articulating
              the kinds of feelings teachers  experience as they work to transform their
              practice; the kinds of  conditions that stimulate strong emotional responses in
              teachers;  articulating the ways in which emotions can energize or interfere 
              with the process; teachers' awareness of their own affect and its  influence on
              their practice; and whether there are "signature"  emotional mixes that
              characterize certain phases of the process of  teacher change.  Outcomes of the
              study will be written up for  publication and presentation at relevant
              professional meetings.   The results of this preliminary investigation will
              also be used to  develop future plans for more comprehensive investigations of
              this  issue.  ***
