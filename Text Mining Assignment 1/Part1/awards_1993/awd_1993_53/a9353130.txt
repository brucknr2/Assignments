Abstract    :
              9353130 Zuazaga The proposal requests funds to establish an Imaging Center for
              the Institute of Neurobiology.  Four instruments to perform major cell image
              analysis or tissue processing are requested:  1) a photometry/microscope system
              for quantitative fluorescence analysis, 2) a confocal microscope, 3) a
              ultramicrotome for serial sectioning, and 4) a three-dimensional reconstruction
              and morphometry system.  The equipment will expand capabilities of eight
              research projects involving ten of the Institute's resident investigators, four
              of them Hispanic women, their students, and collaborators from mainland
              institutions.  The development of cell imaging research will not only enhance
              current research at the Institute but will also further involve minority
              students in state- of-the-art neurobiological research. ***
