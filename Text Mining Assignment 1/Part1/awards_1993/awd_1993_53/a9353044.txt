Abstract    :
              9353044  Metts    This project intends to develop, implement and disseminate 
              interdisciplinary curricula and materials based on an Engineered  Environment
              Laboratory.  These materials would provide instruction  and guidance to
              students for recreating a local habitat.  A habitat  is to be developed in
              Delaware which would interface a temperate  hardwood forest to an old field
              agricultural system and a  freshwater marsh.  This habitat would serve as an
              experimental  laboratory for the development of hands-on activities and 
              experiences that would enable students to become aware of the role  of
              wetlands.  The proposed activities would be also provide the  necessary
              background for them to make informed decisions regarding  the future of this
              critical habitat.  Materials produced from this  project would include a
              generic curriculum development framework  and instructions for the development
              of an Engineered Environment  Laboratory appropriate equally to other
              environments such as  deserts and grasslands.  Materials would be designed by
              teachers in  cooperation with the University of Delaware Instructional 
              Technology Center and others and would be available on a variety of  delivery
              formats.  ***
