Abstract    :
              9353225  Blackmon    This project extends the highly successful Affiliates
              program at  the National Center for Supercomputing Applications to include 
              educational affiliates.  The program is essentially underway and  includes well
              over one-hundred institutions nationwide.  These  institutions designate a
              representative who interfaces with NCSA  for support and resources.  Under this
              project, the program is  extended to educational organizations.  The initial
              four  Educational Affiliates would be the Montana State Mathematics  Network,
              the Texas Education Agency, the Kansas ShareNet and one  school system. 
              Through working with these organization, NCSA will  learn what types of
              supports are necessary for educational  institutions using technology.    The
              goals of the program are to insure computer literacy and  integration of
              networking and visualization into normal school  activities, to improve science
              and mathematics education for all  students, and to provide opportunities for
              interested students and  teachers to engage in special research or exploration
              projects  using HPCC technology.  The project provides local first level 
              awareness; integrates this support with regular activities  available for
              teachers, students and schools; and creates a  mechanism for additional
              activities.    The cost sharing includes salaries of the Principal
              Investigators,  the space, access to NCSA responses, and space/staff for
              workshops,  institutes and seminars.  It is estimated at 20%
