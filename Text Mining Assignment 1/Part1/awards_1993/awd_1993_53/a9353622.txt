Abstract    :
                  Abstract  93-53622    Diane Briars    Assessment Communities of Teachers
              (ACT)    The Assessment Communities of Teachers Project uses classroom
              assessment of students as a  vehicle for professional development.  The project
              supports the enhancement of classroom  teachers in six urban districts -
              Dayton, Memphis, Milwaukee, Pittsburgh, San Diego, and  San Francisco.  The
              project will increase their knowledge of school mathematics and student 
              learning through involvement in classroom assessment techniques.  These cadres
              in each city  will share experiences across the communities and implement
              teacher enhancement programs  for their colleagues at the local level.   The
              project runs for three years at an NSF funding of  $2,842,463.
