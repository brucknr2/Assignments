Abstract    :
              9353019    Stith         The American Association of Physics Teachers (AAPT),
              the American Physical Society (APS), the  American Institute of Physics (AIP),
              and the National Society of Black Physicists (NSBP) plan to host  a conference
              which addresses the problems inherent in the recruitment and retention of
              minorities in  Physics. This one and a half day conference will be attended by
              representatives of professional  societies, academic physics leaders, and
              minority leader teachers and students from several school  systems.  The
              outcomes of the conference will include a set of recommendations and a
              dissemination  strategy which will be effective in the improvement of the
              recruitment and retention of minorities in  physics in schools and colleges
              across the nation.    ***
