Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The University of Georgia will collaborate with the local                      
              State Systemic Initiative projects to enhance                                  
              interdisciplinary science in the middle school by developing                   
              leadership resource teams (consisting of 4 master teachers,                    
              their science supervisor, and two college scientists) from                     
              nine school districts in the Southeast.  These teams will                      
              participate in three summer leadership institutes which are                    
              designed to build teachers' science knowledge base and                         
              teaching, and which will focus on Science, Technology and                      
              Society (STS) issues that are relevant to the teachers'                        
              local communities.  These teams will also develop                              
              instructional modules linking concerns for STS to knowledge                    
              of the biological and physical world.                                          
                                                                                             
              This proposal is appropriate for teacher enhancement because                   
              it is designed to prepare teams of Leader Teachers who will                    
              work with colleagues to bring interdisciplinary science to                     
              middle school students in their schools.                                       
                                                                                             
              Non-NSF cost-sharing is approximately 14.4% of the amount                      
              requested from NSF.
