Abstract    :
              9353996  Bayer  The project provides funds for four workshop sessions to 
              introduce participants to the use of "real world chemistry" in  their
              laboratory courses.  An existing set of experiments -  familiar to and
              preferred by individual instructors - are  placed into a real-world context
              appropriate for the local  community. Students become "chemist employees" in
              the  laboratory of a local organization or industry and work on  these
              experiments reformulated as current projects of that  organization's
              laboratory.  The "transformation process"  describes how science teachers
              without real-world experience  can search out chemists in their local area and
              extract useful  scenarios that can be added to existing introductory 
              experiments.  The process has provided an enthusiastic response  from students
              and motivation for further consideration of a  science career.  ***
