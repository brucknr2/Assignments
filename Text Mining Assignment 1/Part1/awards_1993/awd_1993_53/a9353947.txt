Abstract    :
              9353947  Russell  The project will address the needs of community college
              faculty  in learning the latest in modern chemistry methods through a  workshop
              involving exposure to modern instrumental methods as  well as computer
              simulation techniques to allow instructional  experience on equipment not
              readily available to their  students.  Senior research faculty at UCLA will
              give lectures  on molecular modeling, computational chemistry, multinuclear 
              NMR, GC-MS, Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy, and  scanning tunneling
              microscopy. The workshop participants will  solve typical student problems in
              these areas; they will learn  to use the instruments, and they will adapt
              existing UCLA  freshman chemistry instructional modules using these techniques 
              to their own settings.  ***
