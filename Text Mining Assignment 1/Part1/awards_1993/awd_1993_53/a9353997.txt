Abstract    :
              9353997  Awad  The two week seminar, "FIBER OPTICS FOR ENGINEERING TECHNOLOGY" 
              is designed to introduce 30 faculty members from community and  undergraduate
              colleges to the fundamental principles and  applications of optical fiber
              technology, especially as related  to engineering technology education at the
              two and four year  level.  The seminar/workshop is planned for June, 1994 with 
              follow-up activities throughout the following academic year and  beyond.  The
              program is a collaborative effort involving a four  year technical college and
              three community colleges in the  Boston area. Eighty hours of training will be
              offered, half of  which will be in the fiber optic laboratory, and the
              remainder  consisting of lectures, simulation and analysis using computers  as
              well as visits to local companies that use fiber optic  technology. 
              Substantial hands-on involvement by industry  representatives is integral to
              the program.  The laboratory  exercises are designed to allow participants to
              handle optical  fibers and several of the specialized instrumentation and test 
              equipment developed specifically for fiber optics.  Women,  minorities and
              faculty who intend to introduce/enhance fiber  optics at their home
              institutions will receive priority. No  prior knowledge of fiber optics or
              communications is required.   Follow-up outreach to regional community colleges
              is planned  for the summer of 1995.  ***
