Abstract    :
              9353384  Reynolds    The Chabot Observatory and Science Center Leadership
              Institute  Planning Project will provide the cornerstone for restructuring 
              science education in a major urban district.  During the project,  planning
              will be done to develop a multi-year proposal for a  Leadership Institute with
              a focus on Vertical Science Curriculum  Integration and Staff Development.  The
              Institute would be a  cornerstone in restructuring science education in the
              Oakland  Unified School District (OUSD).  The planning activities will  bring
              together OUSD science teachers, administrators and school  board members; other
              planning partners come from local  universities, national laboratories,
              industry and the community.   Planning activities will also determine the
              science equipment and  supplies requirement for OUSD.  Preliminary planning has
              surveyed  the current status and needs of the OUSD and supporting programs  for
              their teachers in the San Francisco Bay Area.  The Institute  will serve
              elementary science teachers.  ***
