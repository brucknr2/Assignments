Abstract    :
              9353972  Middlebrooks  Five one week long Molecular and Cellular Biosciences
              workshops  will be conducted under the supervision of the project's 
              Coordinating Committee by chairs or co-chairs who are  recognized as experts
              within the topical area of the workshop.  Each of these workshops will feature
              lectures pertinent to the  topic by nationally recognized scientists (these
              lectures will  be open to general audiences). Other workshop activities will 
              include demonstrations, topical discussions, as well as  participation in
              hands-on laboratory experiments. Participants  (20 for each workshop, selected
              by the Coordinating Committee)  will be eligible to compete for "minigrants" of
              up to $1,000 to  develop lecture or laboratory material or methods for 
              incorporation of information presented into their curricula.  Workshop
              co-chairs will be available for follow-up visits to  institutions in the
              coalition. At the conclusion of the  project, a two-day Reunion Workshop will
              be held, at which  participants from all workshops will be invited to make 
              presentations or participate in discussions describing the  various ways in
              which information and skills learned via the  workshops have been incorporated
              into their curricula.  ***
