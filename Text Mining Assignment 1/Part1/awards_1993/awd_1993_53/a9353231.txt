Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The partnership that has been formed with the City of                          
              Philadelphia will attempt to create a national model for                       
              systemic change in science, mathematics, and technology                        
              education in the public school system of a very large city.                    
              The partnership will be working very closely with the school                   
              district as it attempts to put into place a project which                      
              will result in improved student achievement in science and                     
              mathematics for all students.                                                  
                                                                                             
              In particular the planning will include the identification                     
              of special needs of urban students and the programmatic                        
              features which will address these special needs; benchmarks                    
              and five-year project outcomes that will demonstrate                           
              measurable impact on all schools, students, and teachers;                      
              and a process whereby the Urban Systemic Initiatives (USI)                     
              will become institutionalized by the school district,                          
              individual schools, and educational partners in Philadelphia.                  
              In addition, the governance structure and management plan for                  
              such a project will be developed as will ongoing networking of                 
              key stakeholders to the project.
