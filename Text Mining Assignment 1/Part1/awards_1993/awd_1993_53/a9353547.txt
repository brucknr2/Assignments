Abstract    :
              9353547  Elizondo  University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) proposes to continue
              its  Materials Research Center of Excellence.  The UTEP Materials  Research
              Center of Excellence is emphasizing interdisciplinary  research on the
              structure, composition, properties, synthesis,  processing, and performance of
              materials.  The center's goals are:   (1) to establish a nationally
              competitive, crossdisciplinary  university research center in materials science
              and engineering,  supported by faculty with high levels of expertise and
              state-of-  the-art equipment and facilities, (2) to develop the university's 
              capabilities as a doctoral granting institution, and (3) to  increase the
              number of underrepresented minority scientists and  engineers available to the
              nation in the field materials science  and engineering.    The Materials
              Research Center of Excellence was established in 1988  with funding from The
              National Science Foundation under the  Minority Research Centers of Excellence
              (MRCE) Program.  The Center  of Excellence is the University's capstone program
              to attract  minority students to study in science, mathematics, and 
              engineering.  The Materials Research Center of Excellence meets the  goals of
              the MRCE Program especially (1) to increase the minority  presence in science
              and engineering by making substantial resources  available to upgrade the
              research capabilities of strong and  productive minority institutions, (2) to
              allow the institution to  continue the effectiveness of related science and
              engineering  activities for minority groups in its region, and (3) to provide 
              opportunities for minority faculty and students at UTEP and nearby 
              institutions to engage in meritorious research that leads to the  publications
              of refereed journals.  ***
