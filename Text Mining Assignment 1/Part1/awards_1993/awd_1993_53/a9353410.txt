              Abstract      ESI-9353410    PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR:  Dr. Mare Taagepera   
              INSTITUTION:  University of California at Irvine    TITLE:  Orange County
              Science, Technology, and Society Network     This five year project proposes to
              establish an infrastructure  in Orange County for the continuous infusion of 
              science/technology/society issues into the secondary curriculum.  This will be
              done by the partnership of technically-based  corporations with both
              postsecondary and K-12 schools by blending  the expertise of educators with the
              scientific, technical, and  management skills of industry. The project will
              work with 110  Science/Technology/Society Fellows or master teachers in a 
              Leadership Institute. It is estimated that the Fellows will  influence and
              estimated 2000 teachers and through them 200,000  students. This Network will
              encompass over 20 corporations  dealing with energy, aerospace, and
              biotechnology; the Orange  County Department of Education; and 10 post
              secondary  institutions and all of the school districts in Orange County.  The
              project has approximately 35% in cost share of the face value  of it.
