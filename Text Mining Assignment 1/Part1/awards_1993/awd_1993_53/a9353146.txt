Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will be an exploratory study of the dissemination of              
              MathFINDER in two settings:  a university-based preservice teacher             
              education program and a field-based inservice teacher training                 
              program for mathematics teachers.  (MathFINDER is a CD-ROM disc                
              which presents mathematics resources and teaching strategies based             
              on NCTM standards.)                                                            
                                                                                             
              Using qualitative evaluation methods--questionnaires, interviews               
              and observations--the researchers will provide data about the role             
              and use of curriculum materials, technological innovations, and                
              curricular standards that have been acquired from the MathFINDER               
              disc.  The findings should inform and shape the design of a more               
              comprehensive evaluation and utilization study that (1)                        
              conceptually links curriculum materials to a set of reform                     
              standards, and (2) structures access to the materials that will                
              support local reform initiatives.                                              
                                                                                             
              The findings of the exploratory study will be disseminated to                  
              several mathematics and science education reform networks,                     
              including the Statewide Systemic Initiative and Urban System                   
              Initiative projects.  The researchers expect to tentatively                    
              identify and describe the factors that facilitate or inhibit change            
              in reform settings in this study as a precursor for further study.
