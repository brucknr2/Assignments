Abstract    :
              9353679  Collins    The Section of Women in Science of the New York Academy of
              Sciences will hold a one-day  Workshop/Conference for Re-entry Women in Science
              and Engineering at the Academy in  October, 1994.  Intended outcomes are to: 
              (1) provide career advisement for re-entry women,  particularly minority women
              interested in physical science and engineering fields; (2) establish  mentoring
              networks linking women scientist mentors with prospective re-entry women to 
              facilitate enrollment of women, including minority women, into baccalaureate
              programs; (3)  establish a network of small peer groups linking re-entry women
              by disciplinary interest and/or  locale; (4) prepare and disseminate a book
              based on the workshop/conference and supporting  information for re-entry
              women; (5) prepare and disseminate a videotape on the  workshop/conference to
              motivate other prospective re-entry women; and (6) prepare and  disseminate a
              quarterly newsletter to conference participants to motivate their ongoing 
              preparation in peer study groups, and facilitate their enrollment into B.S.
              programs in the  physical sciences, engineering, mathematics and computer
              science.  ***
