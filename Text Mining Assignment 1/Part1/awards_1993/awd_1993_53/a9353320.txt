              involved with education generally agree that "experience is the best teacher." 
              The sad reality of the educational process, however, is that students are
              seldom given opportunities for direct experience of that which is to be
              learned; instead, they often flounder in teaching by telling classroom
              situations.  A rapidly maturing teachnology, first proposed in the 1960s now
              offers a novel unique avenue for the delivery of profoundly situated
              experiential education to students of all age levels.  Usually described as
              "virtual reality," this technology provides sensory inf ormation of such
              fidelity that the observer can suspend disbelief about feeling "immersed" in an
              artificial world.  Virtual realities not only can simulate real world
              environments for learners, but also enable artificial worlds that empower
              immersive, contextualized experiences previously impossible (e.g. slowing the
              flow of time during an experiment).  The goal of this proposed project is
              charting the potential opportunities and challenges of virtual reality
              technologies designed for learning in science.  The investigators will
              integrate a virtual reality user interface with intelligent coaching,
              distributed simulation, and visualization techniques to produce a Virtual
              Physics Laboratory, a first step toward laboratories for other sciences. 
              Experiments in this Virtual Physics Laboratory will focus on remediating common
              misconceptions about physics based on learners' misgeneralizations of real
              world experiences.  Using this laboratory, cognitive trials will be conducted
              with individual learners to research how various aspects of the virtual
              environment (immersion, visualization, collaboration, contextualized
              intelligent aids) can be designed to optimize learning.  This project's results
              will aid in establishing the degree to which virtual reality is a useful and
              affordable instructional adjunct in science education.  If these outcomes are
              promising, funding will be sought for a second phase project to develop and
              field test virtual realities structured to supplement curricular units in
              physics and chemistry (and, potentially planetary sciences and biology) for
              high school and first year college students.   ***
