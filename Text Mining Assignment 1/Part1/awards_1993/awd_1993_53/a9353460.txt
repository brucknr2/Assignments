Abstract    :
              9353460  Brooks  This experientially based program engages undergraduates in
              direct  interaction with schools and the real world of science teaching;  they,
              with guidance from the program's staff, design and deliver  high quality,
              customized science programs to elementary and middle  school classes from the
              very beginning of their science course  work.  The two year program provides a
              rich, supportive context in  which undergraduates develop and hone their
              teaching skills well in  advance of the student teaching internship.  By
              providing an early  teaching experience, the project also provides an
              opportunity which  can motivate science undergraduates, particularly
              underrepresented  minorities and women, to elect the teaching of science as a
              career.  Another expected outcome of the project is an improvement in the 
              levels of science achievement and persistence in science and  mathematics
              programs of students in student support programs on  Long Island.  Over 300
              children will be tutored, mentored, and  otherwise supported through a network
              connecting SUNY Stonybrook  science undergraduates in Partnership for Progress
              with five  federally sponsored programs covering school districts with the 
              largest percentage of minority students in Suffolk County.  ***y
