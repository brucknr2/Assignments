Abstract    :
                BILL NYE THE SCIENCE GUY is a half-hour, weekly children's  science education
              series produced in Seattle, Washington by  McKenna/Gottlieb Producers Inc. and
              KCTS Television in  association with Rabbit Ears Production. The series is 
              designed to make science assessable and interesting to  children in the of
              forth and fifth grades by relating science  at the interests and everyday
              activities of children and  presenting basic concepts from elementary science
              curricula in  a humorous and exciting format. Programs are set in a variety  of
              studio and field locations and utilize special effects and  the creative
              techniques of  host Bill Nye, a popular  television entertainer and science
              aficionado.  In each  program, studio demonstrations/experiments and field
              segments  feature Nye and a diverse cast of children, scientists and  celebrity
              guests.  Experiments and demonstrations use  inexpensive, safe household items
              to enable viewers to follow  along at home or in the classroom. As part of the
              promotion  and outreach for the series, ancillary materials such as a 
              teacher's guide, parent's guide, activity packages and  newsletters will be
              developed and made available to schools as  well as in the home and such
              informal setting as community  centers, libraries, and clubs.   ***
