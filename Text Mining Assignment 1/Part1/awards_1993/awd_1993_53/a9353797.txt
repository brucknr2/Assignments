Abstract    :
              9353797   Rodriguez    Female undergraduates (42), from science, engineering and
              mathematics (SEM) fields at the  University of California, Irvine (UCI), will
              serve in local high schools as positive role models  and laboratory
              instructors.  This activity is part of an effort to increase the representation
              of  women in SEM fields.  The project extends a previously successful model
              program designed to  promote interest and academic instruction in these
              disciplines for underrepresented minorities.   The participating local high
              schools are populated by ethnic groups having historically high  attrition
              rates in secondary and post secondary education and low representation in SEM
              related  occupations.    Success in science, engineering and mathematics for
              women is often dependent upon the  internalized interpretation of female roles
              in society.  Additional motivation and training is  needed for women to enter
              the male dominated (SEM) professions.  The project will help create  a
              supportive environment for both the high school participants and the female
              undergraduate  mentors.  The project also provides critical instructional
              assistance for secondary laboratory  classes.  Low ratios of instructors to
              students (1:35) at the participating high schools contribute  to the inability
              to understand the basic scientific principles taught in the classroom.  Female 
              undergraduates receive positive reinforcement in their science
              instructor/mentor roles, which  give them added motivation to complete the
              course work necessary for careers in SEM.  The  participating undergraduates
              will receive a $2,000 stipend to help them complete their course  work.  ***
