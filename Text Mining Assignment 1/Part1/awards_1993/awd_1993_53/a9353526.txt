Abstract    :
              9353526  Gruner    This project provides two teachers in all 136 Connecticut
              public  high schools with 144 hours of content preparation, training, and 
              support for a statewide institutionalization of a rigorous new  curriculum in
              environmental field research.  Through summertime  Teacher Institutes,
              year-round workshops, and regular meetings with  professional scientists, 272
              teachers will learn new instructional  techniques for fieldwork pedagogy;
              increase their knowledge of  aquatic ecology, environmental chemistry, and
              scientific reporting;  learn to use new computer systems and environmental
              monitoring  equipment; and help students produce formal reports that are used 
              by public and private sector agencies to compile research data  about water
              quality in Connecticut.    The project is jointly managed by teacher educators
              at a regional  science museum and the CT Department of Environmental
              Protection,  and uses public and private sector expertise to enhance teacher 
              skills in a new applied environmental field research curriculum.   Project
              Search links teachers with professional scientists; it has  important
              implications for long-term curricular change and the  systemic improvement of
              statewide high school science education.
