Abstract    :
              SSC-9353260  Kishton, Joseph M.  University of North Carolina at Wilmington 
              Wilmington, NC    "Cape Fear Summer Science Camp"    Cape Fear Summer Camp is a
              four-week summer program combined with academic year follow-  up activities
              aimed at increasing minority representation in the areas of science,
              engineering and  mathematics.  Objectives of the program include providing
              students with hands-on experience  developing the process skills of
              observation, measurement and analysis.  Successive groups of  fifty minority
              students will be taught by experienced public school science and mathematic 
              instructors.  Classroom and laboratory instruction will be integrated with
              field exercises with a  coastal science emphasis.  Some of the accomplished
              graduates from each group will serve as  peer mentors for subsequent students
              and will also participate in focused career exploration  activities including
              involvement in mentoring relationships with professionals working in science, 
              technology and engineering occupations.
