Abstract    :
              93-53659    Geren  Arkansas Undergraduate Research Program  A pilot project is
              proposed to develop a state-wide program to support undergraduate research.  
              Involvement in a hands-on research project is the capstone of a complete
              undergraduate  education.  Funds are requested from NSF, the State of Arkansas,
              and participating institutions  to support individual research projects for 35
              undergraduate students and their mentors. The   program will be administered by
              the Arkansas Science and Information Liaison Office.  Criteria  for selection
              of participants and administration of the program are described.  Students and 
              mentors will be able to request academic and summer support for students,
              summer salary for  mentors, and travel funds for the students to attend
              appropriate scientific sessions.  The program  is primarily aimed at junior and
              senior students, but all Arkansas institutions of higher education  will be
              eligible to compete.  If the pilot project is successful, funds will be
              solicited within  Arkansas to continue and expand the program.
