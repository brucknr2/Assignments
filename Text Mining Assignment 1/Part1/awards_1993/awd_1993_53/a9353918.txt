Abstract    :
              9353918  Landis  This project is developing a portable modular short course 
              which faculty can take within their institutional context to  better prepare
              themselves to teach engineering to freshmen.   Topics covered will include 1)
              understanding engineering  students, 2) achieving effectiveness in classroom
              teaching, 3)  the freshman year curriculum and early student development, 4) 
              student/faculty interaction, 5) the importance of the peer  environment, 6)
              teaching to a diverse student population, and  7) case studies of best teaching
              practices.  Specific materials  to be developed include self-assessment
              instruments,  monographs, videotapes, and study guides to the videotapes.  
              Materials will be developed with the consultation and  assistance of a National
              Action Committee of distinguished  engineering educators.  Evaluation of the
              developed materials  will be via actual use by engineering faculty during
              formative  development and a summative survey of users of the final  materials.
               Dissemination of the course materials will include  the usual conference and
              journal avenues.  An additional avenue  to be pursued includes commercial
              publishers.  ***
