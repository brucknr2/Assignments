Abstract    :
              9353464  Khourey-Bowers    This four year, $737,120 project will train all of
              the middle  school science teachers and 80 elementary teachers from the Canton 
              City School District of Ohio.  The middle school teachers will be  trained in
              two four week workshops in both content, pedagogy and  leadership.  The
              training will include much immersion in hands on  science.  The elementary
              teachers will have only one four week  workshop but they already have had
              considerable in service work.   An average of 4 elementary teachers for each of
              the 18 elementary  schools will be trained.  Principals and other personnel
              from each  of the 32 elementary and middle schools totaling 58, will also be 
              involved in the training in order to maximize the likelihood of  systemic
              change.  The project will begin in 1994 and run through  1997 academic year. 
              The cost share is approximately 12% of the  amount funded by the Foundation.
