Abstract    :
              HRD-9353215  Jacquez, Ricardo  New Mexico State University    The purpose of
              this project is to increase the number of  baccalaureate degrees awarded to
              minority students in science,  engineering, and mathematics (SEM) by
              establishing an Alliance for  Minority Participation (AMP) in New Mexico.  The
              New Mexico AMP  will be established through a partnership of 25 postsecondary 
              institutions including 100 percent of the state's 20 public two-  year
              colleges.  A governing board will implement the alliance in  meaningful
              collaborations with academia, industry, government and  other entities.  This
              issue is vitally important to new Mexico  because: (1) about half of New
              Mexico's population is of minority  heritage including 60 percent of all
              students in Grades K-12; and  (2) New Mexico has the highest population
              percentage of American  Indians and Hispanics of any state.  The New Mexico AMP
              will be a  multidisciplinary comprehensive undergraduate program.  The 
              Alliance will increase the number of minority students receiving  baccalaureate
              degrees in SEM to over 700 per year by 1998 and to  over 1,800 per year by the
              year 2003.  The program will implement  the following strategies:  establish
              articulation agreements that  will serve as the Alliance's cornerstone. 
              Faculty development and  distance learning systems will also be utilized; 
              provide  recruitment, retention, and assistantship programs; maximize summer 
              bridge programs for minority students; and provide research  experiences
              through summer internship programs.
