Abstract    :
              9353012  Betzer    The University of South Florida Marine Science Institute will
               initiate a three-week Young Scholars Project in oceanography for 30  female
              students entering the 9th grade.  The project targets  talented and/or
              disadvantaged girls, particularly minorities.   Students will participate in a
              research cruise.  Field trips to  local coastal environments and research
              facilities will be combined  with extensive laboratory work.  Biology physics,
              chemistry and  geology will be studied under the unifying theme of
              oceanography.   Follow up work will include 4 day long sessions devoted to 
              participants specific research interests.  ***
