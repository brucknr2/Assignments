Abstract    :
              9353060  Florey    The University of Wisconsin-Superior will initiate a 5-week, 
              residential, Young Scholars project in mathematics, chemistry and  biology for
              20 students entering grades 11 and 12.  Hands-on  experience and participation
              will be emphasized.  Participants  will use techniques of exploratory data
              analysis and multiple  linear regression to analyze National Atmospheric
              Deposition  Program data and develop mathematical models of the pH of acid 
              rain.  Students learn of the chemistry of pollutants, the  chemistry of acid
              deposition and the effects of acidification  through field trips.  Career
              exploration and ethics of science  activities are also included. A series of
              follow-up activities  complete the program.  ***
