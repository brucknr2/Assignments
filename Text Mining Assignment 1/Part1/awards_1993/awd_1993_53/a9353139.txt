Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research project, The Underrepresentation of Minority Women in            
              Science and Engineering Education, is the outgrowth of information             
              that only 3 percent of the doctorates awarded to U.S. citizens in              
              science and engineering were awarded to American Indian, Black, and            
              Hispanic women.  The study proposes to identify and clarify the                
              relationship between race/ethnicity, gender, and educational                   
              outcomes by comparing the educational outcomes of non-Asian                    
              minority women with majority women in science and engineering.  Two            
              hypothesis predicts disadvantages for women based on the double                
              oppression that comes from joint membership in the two lower status            
              groups.  It is expected that the research findings will have                   
              both practical and policy implications for minority women in S/E               
              graduate education.
