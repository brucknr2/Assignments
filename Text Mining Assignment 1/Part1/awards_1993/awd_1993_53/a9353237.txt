Abstract    :
              9353237  Sprague    The Mesa, AZ Public School District is a national leader in 
              promoting the use of hands-on inquiry-based science teaching in  elementary
              schools.  The Mesa approach to elementary science is  one of the models used by
              the National Science Resources Center  in the NSF-supported Leadership
              Institute that has been attended  by teams from 126 school districts.  These
              districts, as well as  other districts that are implementing changes inspired
              by the  Mesa model, encounter many of the same barriers to organizational 
              change, the same logistical problems relating to science  materials in the
              classroom, and the same questions concerning  professional development of
              teachers and school administrators.     For this reason, the Mesa Education
              Foundation will host a  three-day Advanced Leadership Conference for teams from
              districts  that are implementing change efforts in elementary science.  Dow 
              Chemical and Hewlett-Packard have supported the change efforts in  many of
              these districts, and both companies will be contributors  to the conference. 
              The conference will focus on three strands:  organizational change, management
              of science materials centers,  and staff development.  This conference will
              facilitate: 1)  advanced training by staff from exemplary districts, 2) sharing
               of ideas and strategies among the districts that are implementing  change, and
              3) formulation of widely applicable change indicators  and a model for
              technical assistance to school districts. The  proposed conference has an
              excellent format, an outstanding  leadership team, and a solid plan for
              disseminating the results  of the meeting.  The potential impact of this
              conference extends  beyond the districts that will send representatives.   
              Cost sharing for this project represents 125% of the NSF  contribution.  ***
