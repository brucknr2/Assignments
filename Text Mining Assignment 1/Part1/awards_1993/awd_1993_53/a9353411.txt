Abstract    :
              9353411  Hernandez-Heinz    This 4-year project aims at providing students --
              especially at-  risk, minority students -- greater access toi challenging,
              colllege  track mathematics courses.  To this end, the project prepares some 
              155 teachers at 4 large San Francisco High Schools to implement two  new
              exemplary mathematics curricula: Course A of the California  Mathematics
              Framework, and the 3-year Interactive Mathematics  Project (IMP) materials. 
              The program provides the teachers  appropriate content background (including
              topics from probability  and statistics, geometry, trigonometry, and
              mathematical modeling),  as well as stressing problem-solving, applications of
              graphing  calculators, cooperative learning, the uses of journals and 
              portfolios, and alternative assessments.  The project has 3 basic  components:
              (1) a 1-week summer program focusing on mathematical  content; (2) intensive
              support during the school year (including a  daily, special, common preparation
              period for participating  teachers); on-site visits by staff; group meetings
              and conferences  with staff; and on-going staff efforts to maintain and nurture
               support from school administrators; (3) an "After the Bell Program, 
              "especially for at-risk students, featuring after-school  involvement of
              parents, peer tutoring, field trips, a homework  "hot-line," and the like.  In
              order to prepare the participants to  become leaders in mathematics reform in
              San Francisco, the program  provides them with many opportunities to develop,
              exercise and hone  their leadership skills.  An external evaluation not only
              looks at  the effectiveness of the implementation model, but also focuses on 
              student outcomes, such as increased enrollment, and success in,  demanding
              college-track mathematics courses.    Cost-sharing is 64% of the NSF
              contribution.
