Abstract    :
              9353865  Pallrand    Rutgers University seeks to provide a four-week, summer
              commuter,  Young Scholrs program with follow-up activities during the academic 
              year for 24 students entering grade 11.  Students will  participitate in
              hands-on laboratory activities, field trips, and  classroom discussions and
              lectures in the biological sciences.  An  important feature of the program is
              the opportunity afforded to  students to work in the Waksman Institute with
              university  scientists on a basic research project that is intellectually 
              challenging and one that is not ordinarily a part of the school  curriculum. 
              By working directly with scientists, students will  idtntify their efforts with
              those of the community of scientists.
