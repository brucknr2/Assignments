Abstract    :
              9353423  Hestenes    This national leadership project will directly serve 168
              physics  teachers.  The project is based on a new paradigm for physics 
              instruction, the Modeling Method.  In Phase I, each of two 6-week  summer
              workshops will enroll 24 physics teachers.  The following  summer all teachers
              return for another 6-week workshop.  Ten of  these 48 teachers will be selected
              as Workshop Leaders for Phase  II.    In Phase II, beginning in the third
              summer, five 5-week workshops  will be conducted by two person teams from the
              ten Workshop  Leaders.  Each will enroll 24 physics teachers.  This second wave
               of teachers will attend a second 5-week workshop the following  summer.  From
              these 120 teachers 50 will be selected as new  Workshop Leaders.    In Phase
              III, the 60 Workshop Leaders will each conduct a 6-week  workshop for 24
              physics teachers covering the entire curriculum,  using the modeling method.   
              Participants must teach at least one section of physics following  their
              participation in the summer workshops so they can use the  modeling method in
              their classroom the following academic year.   The workshops in Phase I are at
              Arizona State University and  Chicago.  In both Phase I and Phase II
              participants can earn  graduate credits.  Cost sharing equals 120% of the NSF
              award.  ***
