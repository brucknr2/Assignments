Abstract    :
              HDR-9353136  Garza, Ray, Berriozabal, Manuel, Borman, Christopher and Valdez,
              Jude    University of Texas    San Antonio, TX      "San Antonio Comprehensive
              Regional Center for Minorities"    The San Antonio Comprehensive Regional
              Center for Minorities proposes a comprehensive set  of student enhancement
              programs, student support initiatives, teacher development activities  which
              will be articulated across all grade levels from Kindergarten to 12th grade. 
              In cooperation  with four school districts in San Antonio, Texas with more than
              98,000 students of whom 92%  are Hispanic, the San Antonio CRCM seeks to
              facilitate systemic change in the education system  which currently enables
              less than 1% of the Hispanic student population to earn a STEM B.S.  degree and
              less than 0.05% of the Hispanic student population to earn a STEM Ph.D.    The
              San Antonio CRCM will offer activities which will address the need to:    1.   
               Create expectations for all minority students that they will aspire to attend
              college and         will succeed in college.    2.     Increase teachers'
              awareness of elements of the Hispanic culture which cause Hispanic         boys
              and girls to find competitiveness to be aversive, and which places value of    
                  family closeness over educational opportunities.    3.     Provide student
              counseling and other student support services.    4.     Improve teacher
              knowledge and teaching skills in mathematics and the sciences.    5.    
              Improve course content, including course curricula and curriculum materials, to
              enable         minority students to learn the mathematical and scientific
              skills and concepts necessary         to compete and achieve in college STEM
              degree programs.
