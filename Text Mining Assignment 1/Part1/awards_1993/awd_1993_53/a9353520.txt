Abstract    :
              9353520  Egreczky    This proposal is the extension of a highly successful
              project  called 'Science Alliance' which is an older private sector 
              partnership project. The first project was a two county alliance  and 50 school
              districts.  The new project will involve four new  counties.  The project will
              do the following:         o    recruit and preprogram train of local           
              scientists/engineers and teachers.         o    pairing of scientists/engineers
              and teachers based on            appropriate areas of expertise and interest.  
                    o    development of industry/teacher/student networks that           
              will bring practicing scientists and engineers into the            classroom to
              provide appropriate role models and provide            teachers and students
              opportunities to hear about up to            date  science from those actually
              doing the work.         o    development of a program of science modules by
              teams of            scientists/engineers and teachers, complete with           
              appropriate supplies, which focus on consumer relevant            issues,
              including technological advances in the physical            sciences,
              environmental science, product chemistry and            product use biology,
              that teachers can use in the K - 12            classroom.         o   
              provision for the implementation and            expansion/dissemination of the
              program through extensive            teacher training by their peers in the
              modules developed            in the section described above.    The training of
              the teachers to be lead teachers in the training of  their peers is critical to
              this project and has been successful in  the previous project.    The cost
              share is 89% of the face value of the award from the  Foundation.  ***
