Abstract    :
              9353204 Park The proposed research will develop a revolutionary and practical
              data compression technique by using least squares Autoregressive Moving Average
              (ARMA) modeling of a signal.  Because of computational complexity and numerical
              instability, least squares ARMA modeling has been applied infrequently for data
              compression.  In data compression, a stream of analog or very high rate
              discrete data is converted into a stream of relatively low rate data for
              transmission over a digital communication link or for storage in digital
              memory.  After developing the data compression technique, a VLSI encoder will
              be designed and tested for the proposed data compression.  Parallel processing
              will be used for fast computation.  Then, the functional and layout levels of
              the new VLSI encoder chip will be designed, simulated, and verified by using
              computer aided design (CAD) tool. ***
