Abstract    :
              9353955  Cassidy  This project is designed to enhance the ability of experienced
               faculty members to teach polymer chemistry, an area which has  become an
              integral factor in electronics, space exploration and  medical applications. 
              The two-year project includes (1) a  two-week intensive residential seminar at
              Southwest Texas State  for twenty faculty members selected from colleges
              throughout  central Texas, (2) a two-semester internship at Southwest Texas 
              State for four of those faculty members, selected on the basis  of interest and
              aptitude, (3) trips to national and regional  meetings for the Project Director
              and as many as fourteen  participants, and (4) an ongoing advisory group of
              thirteen  regional colleges and SWT staff, for continued support.  ***
