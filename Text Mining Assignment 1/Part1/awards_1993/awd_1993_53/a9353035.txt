Abstract    :
              9353035  Heller    The American Geological Institute is developing ten to twelve
              units  of instructional materials for an Earth Science Sourcebook for 
              elementary school.  These supplemental curriculum materials  development are
              for grades 4-6 and focuses on topics which include  the atmosphere, the
              biosphere, the hydrosphere, and the  lithosphere.  The materials include
              hands-on inquiry based  classroom activities, transparency masters, charts,
              graphs, maps,  a resource catalog, assessment strategies, and teacher guides. 
              In  addition these materials are designed to achieve science being  developed
              by a team of elementary school teachers, earth  scientists, science educators,
              and assessment specialists.
