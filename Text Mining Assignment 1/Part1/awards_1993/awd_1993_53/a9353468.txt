Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a request from Claypoint Productions for 124,700 of a                  
              total budget of $526,178 to produce a one-hour prime-time                      
              documentary program on the Wright Brothers, the processes of                   
              science and engineering used in their work, and the science                    
              and technology behind their development of the airplane.  The                  
              PBS program will cover the subjects of aerodynamics,                           
              aeronautics, geometry, algebra, applied mathematics,                           
              mechanical engineering, the process of invention, and the                      
              history of technology.  A teacher's guide will be developed to                 
              supplement the film.
