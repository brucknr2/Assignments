Abstract    :
              9353950  Hughes   A two-week summer workshop focused on undergraduate faculty 
              enhancement in the area of computer networks. Sixteen computer  science and
              engineering faculty from small  colleges/universities (priorities were given to
              minorities)  were exposed to state-of-the-art developments in computer 
              networks, with emphasis on LANs, WANs, and high-speed networks.  During a
              typical day of the workshop, time was equally divided  between discussions on
              network concepts and theory, and  laboratory assignments involving various
              implementations of  protocol and network designs. Each participant was required
              to  maintain a complete notebook consisting of network lessons and  laboratory
              assignments for possible use in future network  courses at his/her home
              institution. Michigan State University  network facilities, including the
              Computer Science Department's  High-speed Networking Research Laboratory, were
              available to  participants for workshop related activities. As a follow-up of 
              the proposed project, a quarterly newsletter is available to  participants via
              e-mail. Participants attended an annual  professional meeting (e.g., Computer
              Science Conference) and  have the opportunity to share experiences. Experts on
              computer  networks were available to participants throughout the  workshop.
              This workshop follows a successful model of a similar  NSF computer network
              workshop, funded for the 1991 summer and  received extended support for the
              summer of 1992.  ***
