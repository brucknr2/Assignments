Abstract    :
              As the world's largest single-dish radio telescope, Arecibo  Observatory in
              Puerto Rico attracts thousands of visitors each  year, of all ages and from
              many countries.  Pride in the  Observatory has caused local Puerto Rican
              organizations to  contribute the funds necessary for the construction of the
              new  Arecibo Observatory Visitor and Educational Facility.  Cornell 
              University, in behalf of the National Astronomy and Ionosphere  Center, is
              requesting $774,463 form the NSF-ISE over a two  year period to develop and
              implement the exhibits and  educational programs which will give life to the
              Educational  Facility.    Within the facility, we propose establishing an
              educational  program centered on the theme "More Than Meets the Eye", which 
              will reflect the general idea that we can study our world with  tools which
              extend our direct sensory experience.  The  proposed program will explore the
              unseen sky and, in  particular, the objects that fall under the scrutiny of a 
              radio telescope.  Specifically, the program will introduce the  visitors to the
              electromagnetic spectrum as a means of  exploration, will offer a framework of
              basic astronomy and  atmospheric science, and will provide understanding of the
               function and operation of the Arecibo radio telescope.  Some  of Arecibo's
              most exciting new discoveries in the fields of  radio astronomy, solar system
              radar astronomy and  astomospheric science will be presented so that visitors
              can  experience the dynamic nature of science.  ***
