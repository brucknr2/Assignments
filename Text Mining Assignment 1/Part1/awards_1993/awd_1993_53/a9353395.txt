Abstract    :
              9353395  Badar    This project will increase the engineering awareness of high 
              school teachers from northeast Ohio.  Project activities are done  at Case
              Western Reserve University (CWRU) where participating  teachers will have
              access to a state-of-the art materials and  engineering laboratory.  They will
              work in eight different areas  of engineering:  Computer Engineering, Materials
              Engineering,  Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Civil Engineering, Chemical 
              Engineering, Biomedical Engineering and Systems Engineering.    The major
              components of this three year project are:            two-Saturday workshops
              and a one-day program during            each academic year for 120 accomplished
              teachers;            two-week, all-day summer institutes for 30 commuting      
                   teachers; sustained support and networking of teachers            with
              CWRU faculty; and            a requirement that institute participants conduct 
                        engineering career programs for other teachers,            students,
              parents, guidance counselors and            administrators.    Workshop
              attendees will experiment with project kits, relating  "real-world engineering
              problems" to classroom activities.   Teachers will also engage in discussions
              and demonstrations of  various disciplines in engineering.  It is intended that
              the  hands-on experience with engineering projects and design will  provide
              content and new methods useful to them in teaching their  courses plus becoming
              a resource for career information.  ***
