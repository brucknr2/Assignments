Abstract    :
              SSC-9353141  Miami Museum of Science, Inc.  Miami, FL    Chen, Judy, Ramirez,
              Alberto and Raymond, Catherine     "Macintosh Using Science Teams (MUST) Summer
              Camp"    A collaboration between in Miami Museum of Science and the  University
              of Miami's Rosenteil School of Marine and Atmospheric  Studies (RSMAS) to
              introduce and interest minority youth to the  fascinating world of marine
              science and its many related careers.  The project, entitled Macintosh Using
              Science Teams (MUST), is a  five week commuter enrichment summer camp for
              students in grades 7-  9.  Students, organized into four-member cooperative
              research  trams, study man's impact on the marine environment.  Field 
              investigations, supervised by Museum project staff and RSMAS  graduate student
              mentors, take place in nearby locations, in  Biscayne Bay and the Atlantic
              shorelines.  MUST teams use  scientific methods to collect information about
              their selected  topic and conduct qualitative and quantitative surveys of the 
              coastal marine ecosystems information is discussed, analyzed and  processed the
              following day in a Macintosh computer laboratory.   Each tram produces a
              culminating research report on their findings  and using multimedia
              technologies, presents it to their families  and peers at a Family Night at the
              Museum.  An extensive follow up  academic year component provides students with
              an internship  opportunity to explore several Museum based science careers as
              well  as participation in a Saturday science and computer club.   Additionally,
              students will participate in field expeditions and  interactive seminars with
              local scientists and mathematicians to  explore science and mathematics college
              and career opportunities.
