Abstract    :
              The Massachusetts Microelectronics Center (M2C) plans to                       
              conduct a two-week (ten day) project-oriented workshop on the                  
              fundamentals of microelectronic systems education.  This                       
              workshop is directed towards Electrical and Computer                           
              Engineering faculty with some experience in VLSI design but                    
              little or no experience with microelectronic systems building.                 
              The goal of the workshop is to equip the faculty with the                      
              resources necessary to develop and conduct undergraduate                       
              courses in microelectronics systems design that would culminate                
              in rapid prototyping and testing of a system that incorporates                 
              multiple components and technologies with well-defined                         
              interfaces.  Topics will include:  the computer-aided                          
              engineering (CAE) approach to systems design, technology                       
              selection criteria, rapid prototyping, technology re-targeting,                
              high-level description languages, multi-level simulation                       
              techniques, and systems design project which illustrates each                  
              stage of the design process with an emphasis on design trade-                  
              offs based upon implementation technology.  A combination of                   
              public domain and commercial CAE tools is used.  Working in                    
              project teams, attendees build a prototype system in FPGAs and                 
              then re-target the design specification to a standard-cell CMOS                
              technology.  One month after the workshop each attendee                        
              receives a set of the chips designed by his/her team and a test                
              fixture for use in their undergraduate microelectronic systems                 
              design courses.
