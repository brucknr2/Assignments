Abstract    :
              Critical Issues in Science and Engineering Technician Education                
              The American Chemical Society (ACS),the American Society for                   
              Engineering Education (ASEE), and the National Science                         
              Foundation is sponsoring a workshop on "Critical Issues in                     
              Science and Engineering Technician Education."  The workshop                   
              participants include key constituencies from government,                       
              industry, and academia.  Important issues in technical                         
              education such as accreditation, voluntary industry standards,                 
              who the technicians are and how they should be recruited, how                  
              they should be educated, the needs of industry for technicians,                
              how the curriculum evolves, and how the faculty who teach in                   
              such programs are educated both in preservice and inservice                    
              programs are being addressed. Recommendations are being                        
              developed for government agencies, employers, and educators.***//
