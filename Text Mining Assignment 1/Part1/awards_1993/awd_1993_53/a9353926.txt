Abstract    :
              9353926  Little  A two-week workshop is being run for two- and four- year 
              college teachers of introductory astronomy whose formal  training is in fields
              other than astronomy.  The workshop will  offer laboratory work, both indoors
              and with sky observations,  as well as offering practical examples of uses of
              astronomical  materials in the classroom.  The lab work will include 
              astrophotography and the use of small CCD cameras.  The  workshop will also
              offer selected topics in current research in  astronomy.  ***
