                                  9353739 Teich The American Association for the Advancement
              of Science (AAAS) proposes a project that will enhance the planning
              andevaluation of the National Science Foundation's Experimental Program to
              Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).  This program was established to work
              with states that compete least effectively for federal academic R&D funds.  The
              objective of the AAAS project is to develop a clearer understanding of the
              concept of state "competitiveness" in research by developing criteria for
              assessing competitiveness over time.  The project will be organized (1) to 
              review and examine state EPSCoR programs in terms of objectives and subsequent
              accomplishments; (2) to examine across disciplines the assumptions underlying
              "competitiveness" of university research; and (3) to conduct a workshop of
              scholars to define and build consensus around "competitiveness" criteria
              relative to the objectives of EPSCoR.  An advisory committee constituted by the
              AAAS Committee on Science, Engineering, and Public Policy will oversee the
              study.  Reports will be prepared summarizing the results of the study. ***
