Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This planning grant will lead to a full proposal from the                      
              Bozeman Public Schools.  The planning grant will initiate an                   
              effort to "create a unique and innovative systemic change                      
              model for dissemination of new skills unique to rural                          
              schools."  Through a myriad of task groups, issues are                         
              examined in the context of rural education where resources                     
              are often not available locally and collaborative networks                     
              are difficult to establish.  The focus of the project is on                    
              individual teacher change or adaptation through a school                       
              district based collaborative re-training project for the                       
              region.                                                                        
                                                                                             
              The planning grant begins the examination and compilation of                   
              strategies that will lead to a Teacher Enhancement proposal.                   
              The cost sharing is estimated at 22%
