Abstract    :
              9353935  Cummings  The complex tectonic evolution of the Pacific Northwest and
              the  associated volcanic activity provides an ideal setting for the  study of
              volcanism.  This program utilizes a field-oriented  workshop format to
              investigate volcanic processes and examine  the methods by which investigations
              in volcanic terrains are  conducted.  During the workshop, five theses are
              addressed: 1)  volcanism and tectonic setting, 2) physical volcanology, 3) 
              volcaniclastic sedimentation, 4) volcanic hazards, and 5)  volcanism and
              resources.  These themes are examined through  hands-on investigations at
              carefully selected field sites  throughout Oregon.  The follow-up program
              encourages networking  among participants and program staff and the use and 
              modification of materials developed during the workshop in  classroom settings.
              The program is designed for faculty from  community colleges and primarily
              undergraduate, four-year  degree granting colleges and universities.  ***
