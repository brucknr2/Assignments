Abstract    :
              9353126  Maclin  The proposed research will focus on combining the emitter,
              detector  and passive modes electrically rather than geometrically in 
              electro-optical materials.  The research will involve modeling and  fabricating
              SiC and Ge materials for devices to serve as active  optical fibers and to
              achieve large-scale integration of optical  switching.  The effects of
              radiation on the operational  characteristics of fiber optical-electronic
              systems will also be  investigated.  In a parallel study, electronic, band
              structure  calculations will be developed to explain magnetism in semimagnetic 
              semiconductors by using and extending the principle, band theory  techniques
              used in metal systems.  ***
