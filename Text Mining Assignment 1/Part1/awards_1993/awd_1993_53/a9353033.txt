Abstract    :
                  ABSTRACT    9353033  Clark    The Human Genome Project has brought to the
              public view the  importance and excitement of genetics in our society.  This 
              videodisc project focuses on that project and especially  bioethics to motivate
              the study of the fundamentals of  molecular and cell biology and genetics.  The
              nine-week  curriculum is issues oriented since increasingly individuals  will
              be faced with making family, career and medical  decisions based upon this
              knowledge.  The modules are  entitled Fundamental Concepts, The Human Genome, 
              Developmental Genetics, Human Genetics, Population and  Evolutionary Genetics. 
              Themes are developed in each area  relative to the human organism, with focus
              on modern  molecular mechanisms of inheritance, DNA, RNA, genes and  their
              variable expression, congenital defects, the human  genome, and bioethical
              considerations of genetic  technologies, etc.  Critical thinking and
              problem-solving  abilities are emphasized to create students who will  continue
              to understand the issues related to genetics.  The  videodisc-based materials
              are coordinated with biology  courses developed under NSF funding.  Appropriate
              role  models from groups under-represented in science, as well as  career
              information will be provided.  In addition to the  videodiscs, the materials
              include a textual encyclopedia of  modern genetics, computer software to
              control and search the  disc and the encyclopedia, and lesson plans.  The
              materials  are pilot tested in diverse locations.  Teacher workshops  are
              available as is an on-line bulletin board.
