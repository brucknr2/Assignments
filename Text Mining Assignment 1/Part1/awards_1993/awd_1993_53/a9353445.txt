Abstract    :
              9353445  Murray    Teams of elementary and secondary school teachers participate
              in  a series of Earthkeeping programs, in which the process of  ecological
              restoration is utilized to teach prairie ecology,  natural and cultural
              history.  The program is conducted at the  University of Wisconsin - Madison
              Arboretum over a period of two  years per group of teachers.  Two groups of
              teachers (96 teachers  total) attend two 2-week workshops, meetings and
              conferences, and  field days at the Arboretum with school classes.    In the
              initial 2-week summer workshop, 16 teachers (teams of 2  teachers each from 8
              schools) conduct hands-on ecological  restoration activities -- planning, site
              analysis and  preparation, planting and management.  Teachers learn about the 
              ecology, cultural and natural history of prairies as they learn  how to
              reconstruct this biological community.  They also  experience activities
              suitable for use in the classroom and have  time to develop curriculum plans.  
               During the subsequent school year teachers and their students  begin to plan
              and plant a prairie at their school.  The 16  teachers return to the Arboretum
              the second summer with  additional teachers from their respective schools (4
              associate  teachers per school on average).  Each team of master teachers 
              teach their colleagues and work with these associates to further  develop
              curriculum plans and activities.  The expanded teams of  master and associate
              teachers offer inservice sessions on prairie  ecology and prairie restoration
              for other teachers at their  respective schools or districts.  ***
