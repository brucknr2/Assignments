Abstract    :
              9353374  Benbow    Operation Chemistry is a 3-year national elementary and 
              middle school teacher project directed by the American  Chemical Society.  In
              cooperation with the American  Institute of Physics' Operation Physics, and in
              conjunction  with the University of Wisconsin Oshkosh and Purdue  University,
              Operation Chemistry uses a "training of  trainers" approach to prepare 36 teams
              of teacher educators  from 36 sites across the country each year to conduct 
              chemistry staff development workshops in their home regions.    Each Operation
              Chemistry team consists of a college  chemistry faculty member, a high school
              chemistry teacher,  an elementary/middle school physical science specialist,
              and  a representative from a local chemical industry experienced  in working
              with pre-high school science education.  The  first 36 teams will be trained
              for two weeks during the  summer of 1994 at the University of
              Wisconsin-Oshkosh,  followed by two weeks at Purdue University.    Six Workshop
              Books dealing with the basic of chemistry will  be the focus of the two-weeks
              training of trainer session at  the University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh.  The 36
              Operation  Chemistry teams will then travel to Purdue University to  work with
              the six "applied chemistry" Workshop Books.   During this latter two weeks, the
              teams will be joined by  their industrial team members.     The teams will
              return to their local school districts to  conduct a minimum of 72 contact
              hours of staff development  workshops during the 1994-1995 school year.  The
              staff  development at the local sites will take the form of  inservice
              workshops for grades 4 through 8 teachers; as well  as longer-term
              college-based courses.    After the first year of training and academic year 
              implementation, Operation Chemistry teams will seek their  own funding for the
              continuation of their staff development  programs; from their states, from
              local school districts,  and from industry.  Each team will have members who
              are  experienced in proposal writing, to fac ilitate obtaining  follow-up
              funding.  ***
