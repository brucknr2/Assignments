              Pemantle plans to continue his research on tree indexed processes and
              correlation inequalities and to begin work on stochastic models for financial
              markets.  He also plans to develop a mathematics liberal arts course for non
              mathematicians and is working on a restructuring of mathematics courses for
              elementary school teachers.          This Presidential Faculty Fellow award to
              Robin Pemantle is for excellent research and teaching in probability.  The
              recipient is also working in mathematics education. ***
