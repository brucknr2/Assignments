Abstract    :
              9353969  Smith  The proposed project would support a coalition of two- and 
              four-year institutions (The Washington Center Coalition)  interested in helping
              faculty learn about new advances in their  disciplines and new ways to
              incorporate these into their  classes. The project emphasis is on
              interdisciplinary science  curricular designs. Four, eight-day
              interdisciplinary summer  institutes would be team-taught over the two year
              period of the  grant. Each Institute would be residential and have 30 faculty 
              participants. Follow-up activities after the institutes include  a two-day
              retreat, involvement in on-going Washington Center  activities, and
              communication among the participants via  InterNet and written publications.
              The Summer Institutes, which  are the core of the project design, are miniature
              versions of  some of the most successful interdisciplinary programs in the 
              state. They provide a "high challenge" curriculum and are based  upon
              pedagogical principles of student involvement that are  recommended by an
              increasingly convergent literature on  improving education in the sciences.
