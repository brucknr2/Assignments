Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Computer Museum in Boston, MA is requesting a SGER of                      
              $49,000 to support preliminary research into the use of                        
              virtual reality as a tool for informal science.  Using a                       
              virtual reality environment of the human cell, they will                       
              test to determined:  1) if people gain a physical                              
              understanding of the human cell, including a sense of scale,                   
              the shape and location of elements, and the physical                           
              relationship between elements, and 2) if people gain an                        
              understanding of the concept of a system by interacting in                     
              the virtual world of the human cell.                                           
                                                                                             
              The PI will be David Greschler, Exhibit Developer at the                       
              Museum.  He has developed two major exhibits at the Museum,                    
              has worked at the MIT Media Laboratory, and has taught                         
              educational software design at the Harvard Graduate School                     
              of Education.  Eben Gay will be co-PI and will have                            
              oversight for the software development of the virtual                          
              reality.  He has been Principal Engineer at Digital                            
              Equipment Corporation since 1980 and has been building                         
              virtual realities since 1982.
