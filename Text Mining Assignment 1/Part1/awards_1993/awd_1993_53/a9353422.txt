Abstract    :
                   The National council of La Raza (NCLR), the nation's  principal Hispanic
              constituency-based organization, seeks  funding from the National Science
              Foundation's Informal  Science Education Program for a four-year
              community-centered  demonstration program.  Project EXCEL-MAS, the Math and 
              Science component of its EXCEL-MAS is designed to develop and  encourage the
              adoption of supplemental math and science  programs for at-risk Hispanic
              elementary and middle school  students and their parents, using thematic,
              hands-on  approaches; and ultimately help to increase the numbers of  Hispanic
              student enrolling and succeeding in paths which lead  to advanced study in math
              and science.         Hispanics -- the youngest and fastest-growing major U.S. 
              population, numbering 22.4 million or 9% of the U.S.  population according to
              the 1990 Census -- continue to be most  undereducated major U.S. population. 
              Only about half of  Hispanics are high school graduates, and fewer than one in
              ten  have completed college; only about one-quarter of high school  graduates
              have followed curricular tracks including the math,  science and language arts
              needed for college attendance;  national studies suggest that Hispanic
              17-year-olds on average  have math and science skills at the level of White
              13-year-  olds.  Contributing to these problems are a lack of culturally 
              appropriate, meaningful parent involvement or family-wide  approaches to
              education, supplemental programs to motivate and  support at-risk students,
              wrap-around social services for low-  income students and their families, and
              efforts to promote  more equitable Hispanic access to the full school
              curriculum.  ***
