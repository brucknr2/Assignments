Abstract    :
              9353910  Geer  The American Meteorological Society, in cooperation with the 
              U.S. National Weather Service/National Oceanic and Atmospheric  Administration,
              will conduct an undergraduate faculty  enhancement project for instructors of
              introductory courses  containing significant weather content.  The purposes of
              the  program are to: (a) provide renewal and updating learning  experiences
              that focus on dramatic recent advances in  operational meteorology and
              atmospheric research, (b) make  available pre-existing and
              participant-developed laboratory and  other student learning materials that
              emphasize the processes  by which the workings of the atmosphere are sensed,
              analyzed,  and predicted on a real-time basis, and (c) acquaint  participants
              with the instructional and research potential  (faculty and student) of the
              meteorological data and  information bases available via a variety of data
              stream  sources.  Central to the program will be the offering of a  two-week
              workshop held twice (in Summers 1994 and 1995) to a  total of 48 participants
              at the National Weather Service  Training Center, Kansas City, MO.  ***
