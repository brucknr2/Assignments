Abstract    :
              9353273  Krebs  The proposed research will investigate the processing of
              lanthanum  aluminate films on a silicon substrate by generating an aerosol of 
              lanthanum and aluminate nitrate.  The proposed research will  investigate an
              alternative ceramic process for the preparation of  epitaxial ceramic films,
              which are now usually prepared by using  elaborate and expensive techniques
              such as chemical vapor  deposition and plasma, sputtered vapor deposition.  The
              aerosol  technique involves the formation of micron or submicron precursors 
              from aqueous solutions of lanthanum and aluminum nitrate.  The  aerosol is
              injected into a tube furnace, which is heated to  temperatures greater than
              900oC, to remove the solvent and form  submicron to micron spherical oxide
              particles.  The particles are  deposited on crystalline silicon wafers and then
              the coated silicon  substrates are annealed to form a polycrystalline film. 
              The  proposed research will investigate the optimization of the aerosol  to
              form a ceramic coating and develop an epitaxial thin film.  The  principal
              investigator will study fundamentally the effects of the  lanthanum/aluminum
              solution and the annealing step to prepare  ceramic thin films on silicon
              substrates.  ***
