Abstract    :
              9353453  Bowyer    This project (Leadership Institute for Teaching Elementary
              Science  or LITES) targets all 1050 elementary teachers located in the 60 
              schools of the Oakland, California District.  A broad-based  coalition of
              college, industry, and science center scientists; and  college, school,
              community, and family educators will be involved  with the LITES effort. 
              Leader Teachers (180) will participate in  a research-based LITES curriculum
              for 5 weeks each year for two  years.  They will in turn train a school-site
              cluster of five same-  grave-level colleague teachers.  Key features of the
              LITES  curriculum will be: (1) a linkage of four informal science centers  to
              teach a 4-day thematic science course on ecosystems in  environments that
              teachers can use year round as living  laboratories for their own learning and
              classroom teaching; (2) a  technology course taught in an industry setting
              where teachers can  learn first-hand the complex concepts in this often
              misunderstood  discipline, and (3) an integration of pedagogy and science
              subject  matter courses combined with practical classroom experience.  The 
              Leader Teachers will be assisted in their task by a team of 29  LITES staff who
              will provide school-site support.  Seventy-two  teachers who have participated
              in a pilot of the LITES program will  serve as consultants to the Leader
              Teacher/Colleague Teacher  clusters.    This proposal is appropriate for
              teacher enhancement because it is  a well-developed systematic project designed
              to enhance the science  knowledge and teaching, and develop leadership skills
              of lead  elementary school teachers of a large, multiethnic (mostly African 
              American and Hispanic) student population.    Non-NSF cost-sharing is
              approximately 70% of the amount requested  from NSF.  ***
