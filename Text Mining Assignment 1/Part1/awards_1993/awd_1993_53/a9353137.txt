Abstract    :
              HRD-9353137  Lee, Clarence  Howard University    This program is a
              comprehensive, multidisciplinary plan by  scientists and administrators at four
              HBCUs in the Greater  Washington-Baltimore-Hampton Roads area --Howard
              University (HU),  Morgan State University (MSU), University of the District of 
              Columbia (UDC), and Hampton University (HAU)-- with academic  linkages with
              selected area universities and community colleges.   These universities have
              agreed to utilize their resources and  expertise to provide quality academic
              experiences for  undergraduates and increase the enrollment, retention, and 
              matriculation of African American, Hispanic American, Native  American, and
              other minority students who are underrepresented in  science, engineering, and
              mathematics (SEM) fields.  The Alliance  will encompass outreach components
              through partnerships and formal  articulation agreements with Community
              Colleges in Maryland and  Virginia, and will forge a coalition with other
              mid-Atlantic HBCUs,  including Bowie State, Coppin State, University of
              Maryland at  Eastern Shore, Norfolk State, Virginia State/Petersburgh, St. 
              Paul's College, and Virginia Union College.  These latter colleges  and
              universities will be invited to network to afford their  students the
              opportunity to participate in the Summer Math Bridge  and Summer Institutes and
              other undergraduate enrichment activities  at Core Alliance Institutions.  The
              Alliance will be enhanced by  existing consortia, linkages, and partnerships
              with industry,  governmental agencies, and mainstream research universities. 
              The  number of trainees directly involved in this program over the five-  year
              period will be more that 5,000 students.
