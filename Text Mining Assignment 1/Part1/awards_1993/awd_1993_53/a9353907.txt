Abstract    :
              9353907  Johnson  The aim of this project is to engage undergraduate faculty in 
              a set of activities that prepare them to teach courses or  course modules on
              professional and ethical issues in computing.  Participants  attended a 5-day
              workshop during the summer of  1994. Follow-up activities include ongoing
              electronic  communications among participants and the director, as well as  a
              2-day meeting during the spring semester of 1995.         ***
