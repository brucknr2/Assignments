Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a conference will bring in 10 teams consisting of a                    
              classroom teacher, a school librarian and a principal for a                    
              two day conference/workshop held just prior to the annual                      
              meetings of the American Library Association and the                           
              American Association of School Librarians.  The conference                     
              will focus on standards and hands on science with emphasis                     
              upon integration of the school librarian and the classroom                     
              teacher in collaboration in science teaching.  A total of                      
              about 13 hours of involvement will occur during the                            
              conference.  A bimonthly newsletter will provide followup                      
              and networking for the conferees and an additional number of                   
              teachers and librarians.
