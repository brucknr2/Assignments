Abstract    :
              9353938  Williams  As a result of the calculus reform movement good curriculum 
              materials which involve the use of technology, modeling, and  problem solving
              are now widely available for the first two  semesters of calculus.  Similar
              materials are also becoming  available for courses which lead into calculus
              like precalculus  and college algebra. In this project a coalition involving
              both  two- and four-year colleges and universities in Connecticut is  working
              to integrate the materials and approaches so that  students taking a reformed
              precalculus course can move into a  reformed calculus course with an
              expectation of continuity. It  is particularly important both two-year colleges
              and four-year  colleges and universities are involved in this process because 
              many students take precalculus at two-year colleges and then  transfer to a
              four-year institution for calculus.    Three different workshops are being held
              in each of two summers  on precalculus and algebra, first two semesters of
              calculus,  and calculus of several variables and differential equations  for
              instructors at two and four-year colleges and universities.   In addition, key
              faculty at 7 institutions are identifying and  evaluating materials for
              precalculus and calculus and  developing further materials which assure a
              smooth transition  of students between the identified courses.  ***
