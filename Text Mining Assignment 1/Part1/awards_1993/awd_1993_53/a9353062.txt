Abstract    :
                9353062  Faile    Chowan College seeks to initiate a three-week, summer
              residential,  Young Scholars program in Interdisciplinary Science for 20
              students  entering grade 10. The students will be provided an enrichment 
              experience in biology, chemistry, physics, and computer usage  through the
              participation of hands-on laboratory activities, field  trips, and lectures and
              discussions. Students will engage in  ethical issues and career awareness
              activities. The highlight of  the project is the participation in a research
              project under the  guidance of faculty members at Chowan College.
