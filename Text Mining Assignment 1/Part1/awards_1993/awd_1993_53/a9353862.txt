Abstract    :
              9353862  Wardle    Brandeis University seeks to provide enrichment experiences
              for a  four-week summer residential Young Scholars program for 30 students 
              entering grades 10-12. The program is multidisciplinary and  provides students
              an opportunity to engage in hands-on class work,  career counseling workshops,
              field trips and independent projects  that enhance thinking and research
              skills. The students will also  participate in directed research projects, in
              which they learn  research methodology and practice through work in one of the
              three  Brandeis centers; the Graybiel Spatial Orientation Laboratory; the 
              Volen National Center for Complex Systems; and Brandeis  Environmental Studies.
