                   F   k               9353740 Kuhn  The proposed research is devoted to
              microgenetic study of the development of scientific thinking skills across
              content domains.  The content extends broadly across physical and social
              science domains, and the work is informed by a conceptualization of scientific
              thinking that emphasizes its argumentive, as well as exploratory, aspect and
              links it to thinking more broadly conceived (Kuhn, 1993; in press).  The
              microgenetic method (Siegler & Crowley, 1991) is used to observe patterns of
              development across multiple social and physical science domains during twice
              weekly problem sessions over a course of three months.  In phase 1 subjects
              work alone, but in phase 2, to address the social context of learning, they
              work with a partner on one problem and alone on  other, allowing direct
              comparison of the two conditions. Various components  of scientific thinking
              activity (planning, generation of data, inference, justification) are followed,
              with particular attention to (a)the role of metacognition, particularly in
              fostering generalization, and (b)microcomputer vs. physical presentation as
              learning contexts.  Generality of change assessed in two ways:  (a)by
              comparison of weekly progress across domains, and (b)through the design feature
              of substituting new content midway through the observation, enabling assessment
              of the extent to which newly developed strategies are maintained when new
              content is introduced.  The research is conducted at three age levels
              (preadolescence, adolescence, and young adulthood), to permit cross age
              comparisons both of patterns of change and overall effectiveness of the
              involvement in fostering changes.  The broad significance of the proposed work
              lies in its contribution to making the enhancement of scientific thinking a
              meaningful goal of science education, for the social as well as physical
              sciences.  To do so we must better understand the nature of scientific thinking
              skills and how they develop across broad domains of experience. 
              Instructionally, the proposed work establishes a basis for helping students to
              connect scientific thinking to thinking that figures in their own lives, which
              may provide a key to effective science instruction. ***
