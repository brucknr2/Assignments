Abstract    :
              9353074  Martin      The University of Alabama at Birmingham, Southern Research 
              Institute and Alabama School of Fine Arts will initiate a 4 week  summer
              residential Young Scholars project in the physical sciences  for 36 students
              entering the 11th and 12th grades.  This summer  program will emphasize small
              team learning, hands-on activities in  the research laboratory and an
              individualized approach to the  discipline related instruction.  Classroom
              instruction on "Doing  Science" will emphasize class discussions, hands on
              exercises and  outside readings.  Additional classroom instruction on "Using 
              Computers" will introduce students to Mathematica, UNIX and other  local
              computer based communication.  Career exploration  and ethics  of science
              activities complete the program.  ***
