Abstract    :
              9353467  LaDelle Olion    The project includes four historically black public
              universities  (North Carolina Central University (NCCU), Elizabeth City State 
              University (ECSU), Fayetteville State University (FSU) and Winston-  Salem
              University (WSSU), a public university enrolling a  substantial number of
              Native Americans and blacks (Pembroke State  University (PSU), and a public
              liberal arts university emphasizing  undergraduate research (University of
              North Carolina at Asheville  (UNCA).  These institutions, as members of The
              University of North  Carolina system have entered into a consortium (North
              Carolina  Consortium for  Undergraduate Research (NCCUR)) to promote the 
              development of institutions-wide undergraduate research programs,  to enhance
              research activities, and to implement the Seizing  Opportunities for Advancing
              Research Scholars (SOARS) Program.  The  SOARS Program initially will involve
              twelve (12) undergraduate  students from the six campuses in research projects
              distributed  among six (6) Undergraduate Research Groups (URGs) directed by 
              faculty researchers selected by the six Consortium institutions.   The research
              projects available in the 6 URGs are widely  diversified, and all have some
              form of collaboration with major  research universities in the State of North
              Carolina.
