Abstract    :
                   California State University, Office of the Chancellor,                    
              proposes to hold a national video conference in October, 1993.                 
              This would be the fourth in a series of similar conferences offered            
              in April, 1992, March and April 1993.  This conference is directed             
              toward teachers of Calculus.  Its intent is to inform teachers of              
              Calculus about new curricula and approaches to teaching and                    
              learning in an environment of reform.  Examples of successful                  
              Calculus programs will be shown and individuals in sites around the            
              country will participate by two way audio between the site and Long            
              Beach, CA, the origination point of the video signal.  A marketing             
              plan includes promotion, registration, advance materials, self                 
              assessment tools, evaluation and follow-up.//
