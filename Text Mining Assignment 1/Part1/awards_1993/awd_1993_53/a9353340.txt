Abstract    :
              9353340  Mixon    The Columbus Public School District plans to collect and
              analyze  data regarding components of the school district that contribute to 
              and impact upon student learning. The planning process consists of  three
              steps: defining and achieving consensus on a vision;  collecting data to
              analyze strengths and weaknesses of the school  district; and developing an
              implementation plan.    Two groups of consituents, the Leadership Council and
              the USI  Staff, comprise the Planning Team. The Leadership Council will  review
              collected data, make recommendations based on this data, and  garner additional
              support from other stakeholders. The USI Staff  will gather data, prepare
              reports for the Leadership Council and  draft the implementation plan.     At
              the conclusion of the self study, Columbus will have developed  a documented
              study of existing programs, reached consensus on the  priorities for achieving
              comprehensive reform, obtained the  commitment of key constituencies to support
              systemic change in the  Columbus Public Schools, articulated a vision for
              mathematics and  science education; identified a detailed plan to guide their 
              reform.   ***
