Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This planning grant is to bring together the elements needed                   
              for writing and submitting a district wide grant for teacher                   
              enhancement in the area of environmental studies and earth                     
              sciences.  Specifically, the planning grant will be used to                    
              build a consensus of support from among the local                              
              businesses, colleges, government agencies and secondary                        
              teachers; establish two high school teams of teachers to                       
              plan two curricula; plan the instructional components needed                   
              for the proposed institute.                                                    
                                                                                             
              The system is now planning to establish a school within a                      
              school in 1993-1994, devoted to the environmental and earth                    
              sciences which is closely tied to research projects at sites                   
              of various state  and federal agencies.  The plan is then to                   
              broaden the participation in these projects to all of the                      
              district schools in the coming years.  The project builds                      
              upon the district's strategic location where there are many                    
              locations of ongoing research including; 1) Loxahatchee                        
              River, a federally designated wild and scenic river, 2)                        
              Jonathan Dickinson State Park which includes a number of                       
              threatened ecosystems, 3) Jupiter Marine Science Center, 4)                    
              Marine Life Center of Juno Beach and 5) MacArthur State                        
              Park.  The Loxahatchee River Environmental Control District                    
              has already provided the annual rent and a full-time staff                     
              member to the Jupiter Marine Science Center for this                           
              project.
