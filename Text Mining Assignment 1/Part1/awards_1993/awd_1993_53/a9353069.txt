Abstract    :
              9353069  Houston    The University of Texas Medical Branch seeks to initiate an
              eight-  week, commuter and residential, Young Scholars project in  biochemistry
              and life science for 20 students entering grades 11  and 12. The project also
              includes a Mathematics and Science  Teaching Perspectives (MSTP) component for
              4 teachers. The  participants will be involved in a research experience under
              the  guidance of university scientists. Other activities include  classroom
              lectures and discussions, field trips, seminars, and  laboratory activities.
              The goal of the project is to provide a  stimulating "hands-on" experience in
              scientific research for  disadvantaged students and their teachers.
