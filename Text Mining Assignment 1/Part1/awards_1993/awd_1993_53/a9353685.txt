Abstract    :
              9353685  McKenney  I recommend that we continue for one year the grant to AACC 
              which underlies the AACC/NSF Fellows Program and which will  generate a pool of
              outstanding community college faculty in  science and engineering for
              participation in activities that  are of service to community colleges and
              improve the design of  NSF programs such as those in technician education,
              human  resource development, dissemination, and systemic change.  I  recommend
              the requested budget of $56,822.  ***
