Abstract    :
              9353771   Nekvasil    The year-long project, known as Women in Science Excel
              (Project WISE), is designed to  encourage women to continue their science and
              math education in college.  The project will be  directed at women entering
              Stony Brook who show academic promise and a demonstrated  aptitude for math,
              science, or engineering (MSE), and will consist of five components:  1) an 
              orientation that will educate the women about Stony Brook, and particularly its
              research milieu  in the sciences; 2) an innovative two-semester sequence on
              Becoming a Scientist that will expose  them to a range of scientific
              disciplines, help them develop critical skills, give them hands-on  research
              experience, and address gender-focused considerations that might influence
              their  educational and professional plans; 3) a basic calculus course using an
              enhanced version of the  Harvard Consortium curriculum that will be taught
              interactively and emphasize a group approach  to learning; 4) a multiple-tired
              mentoring system involving advanced women undergraduates  majoring in a
              science, women graduate students, and women faculty; and 5) informal programs 
              and social activities that will foster collegiality and socialization with
              women scientists.  While  the broad goal of Project WISE is to engage
              participating women in the excitement and challenge  of mathematics and science
              early in their college careers, before they make academic decisions  that will
              shape their subsequent education, the Project has several specific objectives: 
              1) to  motivate the women at the critical juncture between high school and
              college to continue their  mathematics and science education; 2) to help them
              develop confidence in their ability to learn  and perform well in mathematics
              and other quantitative courses; 3) to promote awareness of the  range of
              educational and career opportunities open to individuals with quantitative and
              empirical  skills; 4) to create a supportive social environment that will
              encourage continuation; and 5) to  create a  model program that can be readily
              "main streamed" at Stony Brook, and replicated or  adapted at other centers of
              higher education.      Project WISE is being developed in response to both
              national and Stoney Brook needs to  increase participation by women in MSE
              education and careers.  Few programs exist that target  female students
              specifically and focus on their recruitment and retention.  The project 
              concentrates on the period that bridges high school and college, through the
              first year of college,  because this has been identified as the period of
              "highest risk" in the MSE pipeline, when a high  proportion of college-bound
              students, but especially women, make the decision to discontinue  their study
              of these subjects.  ***
