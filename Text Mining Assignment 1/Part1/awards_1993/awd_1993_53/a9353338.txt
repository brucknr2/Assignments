Abstract    :
                    9353338  Porter, A. Duane    This is a master's degree program for 50
              well-prepared high school  mathematics teachers, primarily from Wyoming and
              Neighboring  States.  Participating teachers have a choice of 2 program
              formats:  (1)  an academic year institute, or (2) a sequential 4-summer 
              institute.  The 14 specially designed courses of the program focus  on
              mathematical content, pedagogical issues, integration of  technology into the
              teaching of mathematics, and assessment.  A  program component focuses on the
              special needs of Native American  students.  A research paper, generally
              classroom-based, is required  for the degree.  After receiving their degree,
              participants,  supported by project staff, are expected to offer "short"
              courses  in mathematics and pedagogy for other teachers in their home  schools
              and districts.  ***
