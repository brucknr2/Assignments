               residential, EAI Young Scholars program in mathematics with follow-  up
              activities during the academic year. The program will consist of  38 students

              for Everyone" workshops designed to interest  and encourage junior high school
              students to take mathematics  courses necessary for a possible career in
              mathematics or a  mathematics related profession. Learning experiences include
              hands-  on laboratory activities, field trips, classroom lectures and 
              discussions, mathematics projects, and interaction with  mathematicians and
              mathematics majors.
