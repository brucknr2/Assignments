Abstract    :
              9353399  Clark    This is a three year collaboration between Brown University's 
              Institute for Secondary Education, the Roger Williams Park Zoo, and  the middle
              schools in Rhode Island and southeastern Massachusetts.   The emphasis of the
              project is to have science teachers doing  hands-on investigative laboratory
              work with university scientists  at the Zoo.  Thirty teachers each year will
              learn research  techniques as they work at the zoo, exploring themes such as 
              Diversity and Anthropology, Reproduction and Conservation and 
              Behavior-Morphology and Environmental Conditions.  Workshops will  include
              sessions on teaching for collaborative learning, using  essential questions to
              frame a curriculum, stressing inquiry-based  learning and using technology. 
              The project staff will observe and  provide support during the academic year. 
              The project is designed  to provide an opportunity for science middle school
              teachers to  experience the Zoo as a living laboratory and to encourage
              teachers  to use innovative methods which will enhance science education in 
              the classroom.    This proposal is appropriate for teacher enhancement because
              it is  a leadership project designed to prepare middle school science  teachers
              to collaborate with a local zoo in developing an  innovative and research-based
              science program for students.  It  will also further the goals of Rhode
              Island's SSI project.    The cost-sharing amount is 41% of the amount requested
              from NSF.   ***
