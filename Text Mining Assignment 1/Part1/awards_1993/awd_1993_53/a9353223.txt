Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project enables high school physics teachers, community                   
              college physics professors and 4-year college/university                       
              professors to participate in the third U.S./Japan/China                        
              Conference on Physics Education.  The conference is                            
              scheduled for July 26-30, 1993 in Zhaoqing, Qixinghu, China.                   
              The theme of the conference is curriculum reform in physics.                   
              The work of the conference will be done by seven working                       
              groups with balanced membership from the three countries.                      
              In the United States, dissemination of conference                              
              recommendations derived from working group reports is                          
              facilitated by the American Associations of Physics                            
              Teachers, the submitting agency, in their journals and at                      
              their national and state meetings.  This conference is the                     
              third in a series of three such tri-partite conferences on                     
              physics education.
