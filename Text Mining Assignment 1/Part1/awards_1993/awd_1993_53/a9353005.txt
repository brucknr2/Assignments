Abstract    :
              9353005  Connolly    California State University at San Bernardino will sponsor 
              a six  week, residential, multi-disciplinary Young Scholars project in 
              physics, mathematics, and astronomy.  Enrichment activities will  be provided
              for 39 students entering grades 11 and 12.  Research  will emphasize the
              determination of asteroid orbits.  Classroom  lectures will develop the
              scientific tools and research  methodologies underlying this central problem. 
              Hands-on  activities will include  photographic plate development, 
              manipulation of a wide field astrographic telescope and precise  measurements
              of photographic plates using a measuring engine.   Career activities include
              guest lectures/informal discussions  from NASA astronauts and scientists. 
              Field trips to local  universities complete the program activities.  ***
