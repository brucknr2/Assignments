Abstract    :
              9353208 Datye The research will fundamentally investigate the reactive
              mechanisms of titanium dioxide-based photocatalysis for treating hazardous
              waste.  For instance, this technology is presently being evaluated for
              treatment of contaminated groundwater, chemical waste streams, indoor air
              purification and for detoxification of contaminants in drinking water.  The
              process uses titanium dioxide powder as the photocatalyst which when exposed to
              ultraviolet light, has the capacity to oxidize organics while reducing
              dissolved metals like Cr(VI), Hg(II) and Ag(I).  Organics are converted to CO2,
              H2O, and other inorganic products.  The metals, in general, are immobilized
              onto the photocatalyst as metallic crystallites.  Prior to commercialization of
              photocatylsis, a need exists to develop a fundamental understanding of catalyst
              deactivation so that suitablestrategies for improving lifetime and
              regeneration.  The goal of the proposed research is to use established catalyst
              characterization techniques and ceramic synthesis routes to improve the
              performance of TiO2 photocatalysts. ***
