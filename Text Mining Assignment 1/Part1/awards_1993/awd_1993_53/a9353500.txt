Abstract    :
              9353500  Stanley    This project builds on earlier and concurrent projects to
              develop  materials for students which incorporate the concepts of randomness 
              in nature.  Participating teachers, and ultimately students, are  given the
              opportunity to discover and explore natural phenomena in  much the same way a
              scientist would.  Using existing units  including random walks, accretion and
              percolation, many activities  have been and are being developed which relate to
              each of the  sciences.  Examples include the growth of nerve cells, lightning 
              strokes, termite tunnels, erosion gullies, tree roots, and forest  growth. 
              Lessons such as these can be included in existing courses  or be combined to
              make a complete one year course on  interdisciplinary science.    An important
              aspect of this project is the reeducation of the  teachers to assume different
              roles.  Teachers become guides,  mentors and coaches to students.  Instead of
              the more traditional  mathematics and rule based science, the students build
              their  understanding of processes and relationships through exploring  natural
              phenomena.    The project trains 32 (country-wide) teachers the first summer
              and  two groups of 32 teachers each of the following two summers for a  total
              of 160 From each group of 32, 10 teacher leaders are selected  to assume
              additional roles and to help train additional teachers.    The cost sharing is
              estimated at 43%
