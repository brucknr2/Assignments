Abstract    :
              9353963  Klee  The purpose of the proposed workshop is to enhance the 
              background and ability of faculty members teaching within the  area of
              computing sciences at a two-year college which serves  Native Americans. This
              purpose is achieved through a five-day  workshop and follow-up activities
              involving twenty faculty  members. Participants are urged to apply in pairs,
              two from one  institution or one from each of two neighboring institutions. 
              During the workshop, the participants are brought up to date on  the computing
              sciences topics and methodologies that can be  offered in associate-degree
              programs, as identified in the  recently-completed two-year college computing
              curricula  recommendations of the Association for Computing Machinery  (ACM).
              By engaging in small group activities based on the  report's contents,
              participants develop items such as  implementation strategies for specific
              content areas,  educational materials, ways of combining topics into courses, 
              and project or laboratory exercises. Through contact with  industry
              representatives, participants are informed about  current employment
              opportunities and issues for graduates with  an associate degree in the
              computing sciences. Upon completion  of the workshop activities, each
              participant-pair is required  to conduct a local follow-up mini-workshop to
              disseminate  materials and knowledge gained from the workshop. These  follow-up
              activities provide means for participants to interact  with colleagues in the
              same or neighboring institutions on a  person-to-person basis. The results of
              the project will be  presented by the participants in journal articles and 
              conference presentations.  ***
