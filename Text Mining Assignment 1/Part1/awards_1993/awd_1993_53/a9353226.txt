Abstract    :
              9353226  Lathrop    This is a seed project to help establish a program which
              would  accept visitors to do research at the National Center for 
              Supercomputing Applications.  The funds are used to set up the  program that is
              expected to become self sustaining.  Teachers, and  others, apply directly to
              the center with their research proposals.   The advisory board screens these,
              the staff helps to find funding,  and a visiting position is awarded.  The
              center is donating space  and support for up to four at any one time and the
              facilities could  support as many as twelve.  It is anticipated that the
              projects  will range from 15 to 90 days and that the participants will have 
              sabbatical leave from their home schools or institutions.  Follow-  up support
              is integral to the project and network access is seen as  crucial to this.   
              Future projects will vary in scope and discipline, but it is  expected that
              visualization and networking will be integral to all.   Educators in science
              and mathematics with strong interests in their  disciplines and a commitment to
              hands-on education will be actively  recruited.  Because of tools NCSA and
              others have developed,  programming is not essential for participation.    The
              cost sharing includes salaries of the Principal Investigators,  the space for
              the RSE staff, the space for four visitors, access to  NCSA responses, and
              space/staff for workshops, institutes and  seminars.  It is estimated at 28%
