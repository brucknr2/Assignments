Abstract    :
                9353495  Brennan      "How Things Fly" is a major new exhibit gallery being
              produced  by the National Air and Space Museum and is scheduled to open  in
              1995.  The goal of this permanent exhibition is to convey,  to the broadest
              possible audience, the essential principles by  which aircraft and spacecraft
              fly.  "How Things Fly"  represents an important departure from other
              exhibitions at  the Museum in both content and execution.  Instead of relying 
              on static displays of historical artifacts, "How Things Fly"  will use
              interactive devices and live demonstrations  designedto spark curiosity, invite
              visitor participation, and  provide children and adults with the opportunity to
              discover  for themselves answers to some of their fundamental questions  about
              flight.    "How Things Fly" will be the first major exhibiton at the  Museum
              devoted entirely to hands-on learning.  It will  incorporate some of the best
              interactive exhibitry ideas from  othermuseums, improve upon them where
              possible, and include a  substantial number of original exhibits.  While
              intended to  help visitors more fully appreciate the Museum's collection,  the
              cooperative efforts, such as publications, a traveling  exhibition, and
              educational outreach programs, will extend the  exhibition's impact across the
              nation.  ***
