Abstract    :
              9353978  Smardon  The Great Lakes Research Consortium proposes to immerse 20 
              undergraduate faculty in a 3-week summer practicum that  demonstrates
              environmental problem-solving as an effective  teaching strategy to stimulate
              undergraduates' interest in  environmental science. This model has proven to be
              effective  during a summer practicum for undergraduate environmental  science
              teachers of two and four year colleges who, as a result  of the practicum,
              successfully incorporated environmental  problem solving curriculum into their
              courses.   Undergraduate  faculty participants learn environmental analysis
              techniques  and prepare environmental impact statements for a hypothetical 
              development project in a contaminated harbor of Lake Ontario.  As they are
              being exposed to new innovative theoretical  concepts and techniques developed
              by the Great Lakes research  community to understand and solve environmental
              problems,  participants will integrate environmental problem-solving into 
              curricula at their home institutions. Special topics, based on  the Great Lakes
              experience, will include the theories and  applications of cascading trophic
              interactions and  particle-size spectra in community ecology; analytical
              methods  for determining toxic chemical concentrations in sediments and 
              fishes; and the use of microcomputers for mass balance and  bioenergetics
              modeling of large lake systems. Through  preparation of environmental impact
              statements for a realistic  project, these techniques will be integrated into
              the overall  environmental analysis and problem-solving approach.  Participants
              in the practicum will return to their home  institutions with expanded and
              updated professional skills and  new strategies, methods and techniques for
              improving  undergraduate education and addressing environmental problems  in
              local communities.  ***
