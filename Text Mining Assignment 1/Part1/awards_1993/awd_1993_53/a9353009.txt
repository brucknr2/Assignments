Abstract    :
              9353009  Kaltofen    Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute will  initiate a three
              week  summer residential program in mathematics and computer science  for 25
              students entering the 12th grade.  Using Mathematica,  Derive, and Maple
              students create visualizations of objects such  as functions of complex numbers
              and algebraic curves over the  reals.  Other research activities include 
              primality testing  using parallel processors, exploration of algebraic
              extension  fields and the manipulation of graphs/directed graphs. Career 
              exploration activities include visits to the IBM research center  and the GE
              research facility.  Careers in pre-college teaching  are also highlighted. 
              Issues on the ethics of science are  considered using small group and round
              table discussions.  Use of  videotapes, e-mail, and  symbolic computation
              software  in the  follow up activities allow the participants to share their 
              experiences with their teachers and classmates.  A formal  presentation at the
              participants school concludes the program.  ***
