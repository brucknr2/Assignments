Abstract    :
              9353854  Frye    Fairmont State College will continue its three-week commuter,
              Young  Scholars Early Alert Initiative Project in physics and mathematics  for
              thirty six students entering the 11th and 12th grades.  The  summer component
              consists of lab classes in physics and  mathematics.  Students work with
              manipulatives,calculators and real  world problems in the math component. 
              Physics laboratory classes  focus on research related to energy and mechanics. 
              Students  participate in workshops related to their individual research 
              efforts during the fall and spring follow-up sessions.  College  orientation,
              career exploration and ethics of science activities  complete the program.  ***
