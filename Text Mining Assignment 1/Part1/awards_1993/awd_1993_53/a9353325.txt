Abstract    :
              9353325  Hamadeh    This award to the Boston Public Schools is to evaluate and 
              cultivate the potential for major systemic reform in mathematics  and science
              education. The study will define how BPS can improve  access to and the quality
              of mathematics and science education.    The two working goals of the program
              are to create a mathematics  and science profile of BPS and to develop a
              mathematics and science  leadership team. An advisory board, an executive
              committee, a  leadership team, technical support team and various working
              groups  will direct the administration of five tasks in five key areas.   Data
              generated will be used to ascertain the status of access and  quality of
              mathematics and science education in Boston.     ***
