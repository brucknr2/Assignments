Abstract    :
              9353930  Alexander  This project establishes a coalition between science faculty
              at  the University of Wisconsin Centers, which are two-year  institutions, and
              other University of Wisconsin System  institutions.  An interdisciplinary
              workshop on environmental  science will be held June 6-10, 1994, at UW-Green
              Bay, with  academic year follow-up activities.  Participants will include 
              science faculty from the UW Centers and the four-year campuses.   The goals are
              to help participants learn of advances in their  disciplines as they relate to
              environmental science,  incorporate these advances into their classes, and plan
              inter-  institutional research.   ***
