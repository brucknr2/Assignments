Abstract    :
              9353370  Geer    This project, sponsored by the American Meteorological Society
              in  partnership with the United States Naval Academy and assisted by  the
              National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the State  University of
              New York at Brockport, will conduct a three and one-  half year national
              teacher enhancement program to train 72 master  precollege teachers in the
              physical science foundations of selected  topics in oceanographic science.  The
              teachers will be mainly  middle-school teachers (Grades 6-8), joined by some
              high school  teachers (Grades 9-12).  All will be selected through a highly 
              competitive process and will attend a two week summer program with  a follow-up
              during the academic year and the following summer.  All  participants are
              expected to carry out in-service activities.   Based upon the experience of
              earlier projects it is anticipated  that more than 1500 teachers will be
              impacted by the project.  In  addition to the teacher enhancement component the
              project develops  modules in oceanographic science utilizing the most
              up-to-date  information prepared by experts in the field.  Based upon these 
              teaching materials an instructional resource manual, including  classroom ready
              activities will be produced and distributed  directly to teachers.
