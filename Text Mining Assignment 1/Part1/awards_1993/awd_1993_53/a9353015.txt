Abstract    :
              9353015  Allyger    Mountain Empire Community College seeks to initiate a
              four-week,  commuter, Young Scholars program in multi-disciplinary science and 
              mathematics for 60 students entering grades 10-12. The program  provides the

              trips to science related facilities. Real  world environmental and ecological
              problems are studied, and  innovative teaching methods are used. The students
              are provided a  choice of study in the fields of microbiology and environmental
               science, chemistry, geology and physical science, and mathematics  and
              computer science. Follow-up activities are included during the  academic year.
