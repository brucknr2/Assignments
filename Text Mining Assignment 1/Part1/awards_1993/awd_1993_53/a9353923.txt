Abstract    :
              9353923  Smith  A laboratory workshop based on recent Nobel experiments will be 
              offered for undergraduate faculty from two- and four-year  colleges throughout
              the nation.  Participants in this three-  week long, summer workshop will carry
              out up to six experiments  based on recent Nobel prize-winning work: 1987 Nobel
              Prize for  High Temperature Superconductivity; 1986 Nobel Prize for the 
              Scanning Tunneling Microscope; 1983 Nobel Prize for Nuclear  Reactions and
              Nucleosynthesis; The 1981 Nobel Prizes for  Electron Spectroscopy, Non-Linear
              Optics, and Laser  Spectroscopy; and the 1977 Nobel Prize for the Quantum
              Nature  of Solids.  The Nobel Experiments Workshop will offer  participants
              "hands-on" laboratory experience using up-to-date  instrumentation purchased
              with a recent ILI Grant from the NSF.   Participants will interact daily with
              local and national  experts on the various topic areas of Modern Physics, and
              work  to develop instructional materials for teaching the physics  concepts to
              science students.  Continued contact with the  participants will be maintained
              through a newsletter and  electronic mail.  The intellectual stimulation and
              personal  involvement experienced by the participants will help them to  relay
              the excitement of science to students at their home  institutions.  ***
