Abstract    :
              9353886  Morrell    Atlanta Metropolitan College seeks to provide a five-week, 
              commuter, Young Scholars project in chemistry and mathematics for  32 students
              entering grades 7 and 8. The project is designed to  enhance the scientific and
              mathematical awareness of under-served  minority and female students. The
              students will be involved in  classroom discussions and lectures, and
              laboratory and field  activities stemming from an investigation into the
              chemistry of the  environment. The students will also investigate the concepts 
              involved in mathematical modeling.
