Abstract    :
              9353081  Sambrotto    This project is to develop an interactive, computer based
              program  that will promote conceptualization through student exploration of 
              relevant scientific and societal issues in earth science.  The  proposed
              software would provide the capability to access, analyze  and model
              geographically based data using a state of the art  graphical interface and
              would retrieve data over a distributed  computer network such as Internet.  The
              proposed curriculum  entitled EARTH VIEW is to be a general model by which
              computer  networking can be used to expand the classroom.  A personalized 
              notebook would be developed and used to guide students' exploration  and would
              provide a site for recording findings and  interpretations.  This notebook
              would also serve as a portfolio for  evaluation of learning progress.  A CD-ROM
              would be produced for  those schools who did not have direct access to an
              on-line data  source or Internet.
