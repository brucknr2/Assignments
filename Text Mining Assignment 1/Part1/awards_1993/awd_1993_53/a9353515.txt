Abstract    :
              9353515  Anderson    Volcanology for Earth Science Teachers is series of
              three-week  workshops for 25 teachers to be held during the summers of 1994 and
               1995 at the Hilo Campus.  The focus of these workshops will be the  study of
              active volcanoes.  The objective will be to improve  middle/secondary earth
              science instruction by preparing  participants to effectively teach their
              students about volcanoes,  related geological processes and principles, such as
              plate  tectonics and earthquakes.  Science knowledge development, hands on 
              activities, interactions with scientists, field experiences,  teaching
              strategies, and the development of teaching materials will  make up the core of
              the program.  A "resource book" will be  compiled and validated for each
              participant.  The participants will  be expected to improve earth science
              curricula and classroom  instruction upon returning to their schools.
