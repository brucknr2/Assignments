Abstract    :
              9353908  Caverly  The workshop focuses on introducing undergraduate electrical 
              engineering faculty to analog VLSI design principles as a  natural outgrowth of
              the digital VLSI design process. These  faculty are prepared to bring these
              design principles back to  their universities for introduction to undergraduate
              electrical  engineering students. The week-long workshop is a unique mix of 
              analog design concepts, circuit simulation and laboratory  measurements on
              typical CMOS analog circuits. User groups will  be formed with the participants
              as a means to share information  and provide leadership in bringing analog VLSI
              design concepts  to an undergraduate audience.    ***
