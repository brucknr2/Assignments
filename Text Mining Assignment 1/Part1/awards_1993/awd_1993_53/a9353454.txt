Abstract    :
              9353454  Saul    The Elementary Science Integration Project (ESIP) promotes 
              integration of hands-on inquiry-centered elementary school  science instruction
              with language arts and other subject areas.  Teachers are encouraged to work as
              classroom researchers engaged  in "action research" with students on a variety
              of topics that  arise in the classroom.  A 1990 NSF Teacher Enhancement award
              has  supported professional development for approximately 50 teachers  who are
              now prepared to act as teacher-consultants in training 65  new ESIP
              participants.  Teacher enhancement activities would  include two summers and
              the intervening academic year.  This  approach stresses the strengths shared by
              many elementary  schoolteachers -- the ability to recognize and pursue topics
              of  interest to their students.  Past ESIP participants have been  extremely
              productive in writing and publishing the results of  their classroom research,
              and in sharing their experiences with  other teachers through presentations and
              inservice workshops.     Expansion of ESIP to more teachers will create a
              critical mass of  classroom teachers who are capable of fostering inquiry 
              activities that cross disciplinary boundaries.  Their teaching  and writing
              will serve as a model for an innovative approach to  the professional
              development of teachers.     Cost sharing on this project represents 23% of the
              NSF  contribution.  ***
