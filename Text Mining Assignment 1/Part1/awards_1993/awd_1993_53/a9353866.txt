Abstract    :
              9353866  Warshauer    Southwest Texas State University will initiate a six week 
               residential Young Scholars program in mathematics for 48 students  entering
              the 11th and 12th grades.  Students are taught to reason  rigorously and
              precisely while experiencing the excitement of  mathematical discovery. 
              Students receive classroom instruction in  number theory, discrete
              mathematics,as well as programming in  Mathematica.  An honors seminar examines
              philosophical and ethical  issues as well as career options.  Students will be
              provided a  license for Mathematica and a modem to take back to their school. 
              All students will develop collaborative projects which build on  ideas learned
              during the summer.  ***
