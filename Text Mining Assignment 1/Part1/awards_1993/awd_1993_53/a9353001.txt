Abstract    :
              9353001  Stevens    The University of Kentucky at Lexington  will offer a
              three-week  summer residential program in earth sciences for 24 students 
              entering grades seven through nine.  Students study landforms,  energy
              production/use, water quality, forest resources and  technology using
              classroom, laboratory and field activities.  Participants work in small groups
              and cooperative learning is  stressed.  Research mentorships at local
              industrial settings  enable students to see how practicing scientists use earth
               science on a daily basis.  Ethics of science will be introduced  using videos,
              simulation games and informal/formal discussions.   Follow up activities
              including a  presentation by participants at  their high school or local civic
              organization conclude the  program activities.  ***
