Abstract    :
              9353353  Rowe    Curriculum development projects depend for their success on 
              fruitful collaboration between developers and teachers.  In many  projects,
              however, trial sites are spread around the country making  on going
              communication and feedback cumbersome.  As a result  projects suffer because
              developers do not receive and respond to  feedback in a timely manner.  The
              purpose of this project is to  create a viable electronic learning community in
              conjunction with  a science curriculum development project for middle schools. 
              In  theory the potential contribution of electronic networks is great.   In
              practice, however, few have survived and none have been studied  carefully
              enough to provide a useful knowledge base on which to  build others.  Two NSF
              funded projects will collaborate, one in  curriculum and one that has developed
              communication software  especially suited to help people who are geographically
              dispersed  work together to produce better results.  One product of this study 
              will be the preparation of guidelines for the formation of new  electronic
              learning communities.  ***
