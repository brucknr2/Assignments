Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This disparity in interest and achievement in mathematics                      
              and science between white male students and female and                         
              minority students is a problem that needs to be addressed.                     
              At a three day conference in July 1993, Luther College will                    
              bring together college educators from Lutheran Colleges                        
              across the United States and elementary and secondary                          
              educators from Iowa, Minnesota and Wisconsin to examine                        
              current research findings on this topic.                                       
                                                                                             
              Two hundred participants will be introduced to materials and                   
              pedagogical methods designed to remove the disparity in                        
              student interest and achievement.  Presentations will focus                    
              on changing classroom activities from elementary through                       
              college instruction including teacher education.  The goal                     
              is that the event will serve as a resource that will enable                    
              educators at all levels:                                                       
                                                                                             
              *  to understand the causes of the disparities math science                    
               achievement and interest among student populations.                           
                                                                                             
              *  to implement teaching methods and materials that remove                     
                 obstacles and disincentives that can cause disparities in                   
                achievement and interest.                                                    
                                                                                             
              *  to motivate more female and minority-group students to                      
                 pursue careers in mathematics and science.
