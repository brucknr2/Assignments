Abstract    :
              9353075  Stoebe    The University of Washington seeks to initiate a 4-week,
              summer  commuter, Young Scholars program focused on the Physics of  Robotics.
              The program will be for 40 Seattle Mathematics,  Engineering, Science
              Achievement (MESA) minority students in grades  7th and 8th. The program
              provides students with an opportunity to  engage in classroom, laboratory,
              field trips, and research  activities with University faculty during the
              summer. The project  terminates during the academic year with the design and 
              construction of a complex engineering system involving a robot.
