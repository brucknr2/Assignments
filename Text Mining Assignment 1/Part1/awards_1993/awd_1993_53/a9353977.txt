Abstract    :
              9353977  Hartman  This is a two week workshop for faculty with limited access to
               parallel computers.  Participants learn to integrate parallel  processing into
              their courses.  Tools include transputers,  simulators, and a network
              connection to a research center.  Topics include parallel algorithms, design of
              parallel  programs, parallel architectures, integration of parallel  processing
              into an undergraduate computer curriculum, and  methods for teaching parallel
              processing to undergraduates. The  workshop includes lectures and laboratory
              sessions focusing on  writing parallel programs and developing curriculum
              materials.   The participants are expected to develop an instructional unit  on
              parallel computing that they will teach in the 1994-95  academic year.  ***
