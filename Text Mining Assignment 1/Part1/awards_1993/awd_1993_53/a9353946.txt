Abstract    :
              9353946  Borrelli  This project is continuing the activities of an ongoing
              project  using computer experiments in differential equations.  The  goals of
              the project include (a) development of expertise in  the use of interactive
              computer experiments in a laboratory  setting, (b) opportunity for creation of
              ordinary differential  equation exercises for classroom and laboratory use, and
              (c)  networking of faculty teaching ordinary differential equations.   In
              particular, this award is adding Stetson University to the  differential
              equations consortia consisting of the following  six institutions: Cornell
              University, Harvey Mudd College, St.  Olaf College, West Valley College,
              Rensselaer Polytechnic  Institute, and Washington State University. 
              Differential  equation workshops are being held during the summer of 1994 at 
              Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and West Valley College and at  Stetson
              University during the summer of 1995.                   ***
