Abstract    :
              9353936  McGregor  The project will support activities that enhance the
              knowledge  of faculty concerning the laboratory approach to teaching  computer
              science. During a summer workshop, faculty will  develop laboratory activities,
              class-test them over an academic  year, and evaluate and refine them during a
              second summer  workshop. One of the content threads along which faculty will 
              create activities is the area of multiprocessing.  ***
