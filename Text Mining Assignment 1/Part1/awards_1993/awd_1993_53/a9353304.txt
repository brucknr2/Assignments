Abstract    :
              9353304  Parrish    The Cleveland City School District will implement a
              self-study  assessment and planning project to define the needs, set 
              priorities, improve coordination of existing programs and design a 
              comprehensive science and mathematics reform program. This effort  will be
              built upon a broad based vision for educational reform and  school improvement
              developed through the collaborative efforts of  the City of Cleveland, the
              Superintendent, the Board of Education  and key community stakeholders.     
              Two groups, The Commission for Systemic Reform in Mathematics and  Science
              Education and The Steering Committee will direct the self  study and planning
              initiative. An advisory council will assure  continued constituent
              participation and information exchange.   ***
