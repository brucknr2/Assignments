Abstract    :
              9353184 deBossenet The proposed research will develop further the symbolic
              manipulation system (SMS), which is a unified approach to knowledge
              representation, automated reasoning, and simulation of human conversation. 
              With a symbolic language (SL) to build databases, the project will simulate the
              mental associations of human beings when responding to one another in
              conversations.  The associations usually are based on deductive or
              probabilistic relations.  The proposed research will extend SMS theory to
              include non-standard association and inference with the flexibility to operate
              in a conversational mode.  The symbolic manipulation system will also handle
              imprecise and incomplete information in its inference operations by using SL to
              represent ambiguity, vagueness or incompleteness.  The significance of the
              proposed research would be the advancement of expert systems through the
              establishment of a nonstandard theory of association and inference to address
              problems connected with the elicitation of imprecise or incomplete knowledge.
