Abstract    :
              Boston Museum of Science seeks funds from the National Science  Foundation fort
              the development of a group of interactive exhibits  and educational programs
              that will comprise the Museum's permanent  TESTING THE THEORY activity center. 
              The project is part of a new  approach to exhibits that  aims to make the
              experiences available  to visitors closer to the actual process of scientific
              discovery.   Visitors will carry out experiments in fields ranging from 
              chemistry and cognitive psychology, to statistics, optics, and  materials
              science.  The focus will be on promoting specific  experimental skills and
              scientific habits of mind, and on  encouraging the transfer of these skills to
              everyday activities.   The exhibit techniques developed during the prototyping
              and  production of TESTING THE THEORY are expected to be of importance  to
              science museums and others concerned with increasing science  literacy.  ***
