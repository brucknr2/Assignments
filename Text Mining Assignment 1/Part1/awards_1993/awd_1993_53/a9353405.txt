Abstract    :
              9353405  Pica    A five year program is proposed which will promote effective 
              inquiry based science teaching and learning in the elementary  grades of the
              school district of Philadelphia.  It has three  principle objectives:        
              1.   to improve the teaching of science through the            establishment of
              a cadre of Leader teachers to serve as            mentors and change agents;   
                   2.   to deepen and extend students' knowledge and            understanding
              of science by integrating science learning            with instruction in the
              language arts, and         3.   motivate students from historically
              underrepresented            groups to pursue further study and career selection
              in            science and technology.    The Collaborative brings together
              teachers, university faculty and  professional scientists who share a
              commitment to the enhancement  of science teaching and learning.    The
              Collaborative will focus its efforts in the District's  southwest region, whose
              25 schools have a predominantly minority  population.  Teams of 4 elementary
              teachers (grades 1-3) from these  schools will participate in the first two
              years to build up a  critical mass of Leader Teachers.  They will attend an
              intensive  three week summer institute, a graduate level continuing education 
              seminar during the academic year and a three week institute during  the
              following summer.    Teachers will work with materials which they will use in
              their  classroom-the Franklin Institute hands-on science kits-as the 
              sprongboard to exploring basic science concepts and discovering  strategies for
              engaging students in their own explorations.  Pre-  service teachers will be
              invited to attend the summer institutes.   An annual spring conference will
              bring together current and former  participants share information and
              experiences.  By the end of the  five years the school district will have in
              place approximately 250  leader teachers.    The funds requested amount to
              $1,780,796 for 5 years with cost  share estimated  at $784,039.
