Abstract    :
              93-53649  Shehata  Maine Experimental Systemic Initiative  The Research
              Excellence Partnership has developed a one-year pilot program to stimulate 
              collaborative research among Maine's public and private research institutions. 
              This initiative,  which is a component of Maine's Science and Technology
              Strategic Plan, would take advantage  of the state's Centers for Innovation in
              aquaculture, biomedical technology, and metals and  electronics.    The program
              would encourage Maine firms to work with academic-based researchers to address 
              industry challenges.  The collaborations would not only produce short-term
              benefits for  businesses at the heart of Maine's economy, but they would
              position the  participants, as  individuals and as cohesive research groups, to
              expand their research capacities.    Maine EPSCoR is requesting $75,000 to
              pilot test this program.  The Maine Science and  Technology Commission, as
              fiscal agent, will provide additional funding totaling $77,158.
