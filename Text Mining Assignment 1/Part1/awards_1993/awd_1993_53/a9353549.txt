Abstract    :
              9353549  Gonzalez  University of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez Campus proposes to
              continue  its Center of Excellence in Tropical and Caribbean Research.  The 
              Center was established (1) to develop areas of research that will  contribute
              to solve the pipeline problem of minority access to  careers in science, and
              (2) to exploit and study the unique  tropical advantages available within
              Puerto Rico.  The objectives  of the Center are:  (1) to develop a research
              infrastructure to  promote collaboration between the strongest research groups
              on the  island, (2) to compete for funding from major funding sources, (3)  to
              strengthen the instrumentation base, (4) to promote  collaborations with other
              research entities on a national and  international level, (5) to provide
              collaborative research  opportunities for researchers at 4-year institutions,
              (6) to  provide educational improvement activities for faculty and  graduate,
              undergraduate and precollege students, and (7) to  contribute to the
              strengthening of a competitive research  environment in Puerto Rico.    The
              Center of Excellence for Tropical and Caribbean Research was  established in
              1988 with funding from the National Science  Foundation under the Minority
              Research Centers of Excellence (MRCE)  Program.  The Center of Excellence meets
              the goals of the MRCE  Program especially (1) to increase the minority presence
              in science  and engineering by making substantial resources available to 
              upgrade the research capabilities of strong and productive minority 
              institutions, (2) to allow the institution to continue use of  research as a
              tool to increase the effectiveness of related science  and engineering
              activities for minority groups in its region, (3)  to provide opportunities for
              minority faculty and students at  the University of Puerto Rico, and (4) to
              engage in meritorious  research that leads to publications in refereed
              journals.  ***
