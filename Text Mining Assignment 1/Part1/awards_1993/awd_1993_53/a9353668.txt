Abstract    :
                9353668  Boschmann       An Invitational conference on teaching laboratory
              science at  a distance is proposed.  Increasing use of distance education 
              delivery systems has stimulated the teaching of laboratory sciences  by the
              same means.  However, the laboratory aspect of such courses  is usually
              problematic.  Several solutions have been advanced by   professors of biology,
              chemistry, physics and earth sciences in the  United States, Canada and the
              United Kingdom.  People having these  experiences will share their solutions
              with others who are engaged  in similar instructional situations.  This
              conference will identify  key issues, discuss alternative procedures, and
              establish a network  for continuing communication among the participants and
              others who  are using distance education delivery systems.
