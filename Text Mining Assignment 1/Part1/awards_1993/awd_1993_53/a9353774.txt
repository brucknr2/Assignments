Abstract    :
              9353774  Fentiman    The proposed project is a one-week workshop for incoming
              freshman women who expect to  study engineering, and are qualified to enroll in
              Engineering Graphics 166, the first engineering  course at The Ohio state
              University.  The goal of the workshop is to improve retention of  women in the
              engineering program by offering them some skills needed to succeed in their
              first  engineering course.    The workshop is to be be conducted in the summer
              of 1994.  Approximately 30 women are  expected to participate.  Experiences
              planned for the workshop will help students to develop  visualization skills,
              become familiar with engineering terminology, and exercise problem solving 
              skills.  Meetings will women engineers and more senior engineering students
              will help  participants prepare for success in engineering.  Materials and
              lesson plans for the workshop will  be developed during the 1993-94 academic
              year by members of the Ohio State University  Engineering Graphics faculty with
              the support of the women in Engineering Program and the  College of
              Engineering.  Success of the workshop will be assessed by measuring the
              student's  performance in their first engineering graphics course and
              calculating the retention rate for  participants.  ***
