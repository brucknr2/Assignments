              Bock        This is a proposal to evaluate the effectiveness of essay questions
              in biology designed to test the student's understanding of three main aspects
              of scientific work    inquiry, explanation, and confirmation.  Scoring
              protocols based on ratings of content knowledge and process skills will be
              developed and tested for feasibility and reliability.  In addition, a form of
              holistic scoring based on comparative judgment rather than rating will be
              investigated as a possible teacher based method of scoring essay test questions
              in science.  The procedures will be evaluated in a field trial associated with
              the California Golden State Examination in Biology.
