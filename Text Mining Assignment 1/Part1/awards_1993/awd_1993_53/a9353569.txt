Abstract    :
                   This is an exploratory interview study with high school                   
              students in the greater New York metropolitan area to determine                
              what attitudes, competencies, and motivations explain why some                 
              students who are taking low-level, academically dead-end math                  
              courses, and who may be doing poorly in them, nevertheless express             
              positive attitudes toward math, and report that success in                     
              mathematics will be important for their careers and lives.                     
              Generally, the educational psychology literature reports a                     
              correlation between achievement in a subject, but among Blacks                 
              especially this relationship does not always hold.  If the factors             
              in such a situation can be elucidated, effective encouragement and             
              intervention by school personnel may be made possible.
