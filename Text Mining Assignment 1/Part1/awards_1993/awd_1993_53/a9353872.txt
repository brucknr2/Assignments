Abstract    :
              9353872  Bustoz    Arizona State University will continue a Young Scholars
              project  in science, mathematics and computer science.  120 students from  the
              Navajo reservation will be introduced to experiments in  mathematics.  Students
              will learn to program in BASIC  Applications of mathematics to elementary
              physics and astronomy  will be a  unifying theme.  Field trips to local
              planetariums,  museums and universities as well as ethics/career discussions
              are  also featured.  Several follow up meetings during the academic  year
              complete the program.   ***
