Abstract    :
              9353059  Aliaga    The University of Michigan at Ann Arbor seeks to provide an 
              innovative summer program in mathematics for 30 female students  entering grade
              9 in schools located in Detroit, Michigan. The  program is a three-week summer
              residential Young Scholars project  in mathematics with follow-up activities
              during the academic year.  The program is designed to accomplish the following
              objectives:  enhance students' positive attitudes toward mathematics and 
              statistics; develop confidence in their potential in the field of  mathematics;
              encourage the female students to pursue careers in  mathematics; and to
              incorporate mathematical skills and thinking in  their everyday lives. This
              will be accomplished through classroom  discussions, field trips and
              participation in hands-on laboratory  activities. Instructional classroom
              activities will be conducted by  professors from the Departments of Mathematics
              and Statistics on  the campus of the University of Michigan.
