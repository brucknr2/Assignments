Abstract    :
              9353555  Giamati    This planning grant invites 35 teachers and administrators
              to the  Northern Arizona University campus to attend two weekend-long  meetings
              and to participate in follow-up networking that will lead  to the submission of
              a proposal to the National Science Foundation  Teacher Enhancement Program. 
              That future proposal, which would  serve Native American teachers and teachers
              who are employed by  districts with a large Native American population, is
              anticipated  as a project consisting of a series of summer courses and
              academic-  year follow-up activities for teachers of elementary and middle 
              school mathematics.  The educators who make up the planning  committee either
              represent elementary and middle schools and  educational consortia from the
              targeted population or are community  college or university personnel who have
              special expertise in  Native American education.  The planning grant provides
              funds to  cover expenses associated with organizing, attending, and  conducting
              the two planning meetings and establishing a computer  network among the
              members of the planning committee.
