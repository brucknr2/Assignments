Abstract    :
              Among the concerns of the American Association for the  Advancement of Science
              (AAAS) for undergraduate science and  mathematics education are the large
              attrition of students from  introductory to the intermediate courses and
              concomitant  declining numbers of majors, lack of attractive offerings for 
              non-science majors, poor science and mathematics preparation  for prospective
              pre-college teachers, and inability to recruit  and retain women and minority
              students.  Other organizations,  including the NSF, also have concerns and
              issues that they  would like to bring to the attention of appropriate
              university  faculty and administrators for action and/or comment.  There  is,
              at present, no single effective and efficient access point  for presenting
              these to the higher education community , nor,  more seriously, for
              coordinating and exchanging information  among the science and mathematics
              departments at different  institutions.  This is a missing piece of the science
              and  mathematics teaching/learning infrastructure.  The AAAS  proposes here a
              mechanism, a Science Deans Colloquium, for  addressing the problem of access to
              the science and mathematics  communities in large research universities with
              the long-term  goal of improving undergraduate science and mathematics 
              education through continued interaction among the Deans.  ***
