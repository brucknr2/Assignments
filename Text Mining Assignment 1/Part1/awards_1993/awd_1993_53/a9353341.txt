Abstract    :
                    The Association of Science-Technology Centers (ASTC) is  requesting
              $50,000 to investigate and report on education  activities linking science
              centers with schools.  The research  will examine the nature and levels of
              service currently  provided by science centers, and produce a report that 
              describes the current status with an emphasis on  understandings that provide
              insight for program planning.  The  study will gather information from both
              museums and schools  and museums where collaborative efforts are not occurring
              to  investigate the barriers that have discouraged linkages.   ***
