Abstract    :
              9353055  Nashner-Whitney    The Oregon Graduate Institute of Science and
              Technology will  initiate a four week commuter Young Scholars project in
              discrete  and applied mathematics for thirty African Americans entering the 
              ninth grade.  The program will stress positive career skills,  appropriate
              problem solving skills and the development of a network  supportive of pursuit
              of mathematics or mathematics dependent  careers.  Students work in small
              groups with peer, tutor, and  instructor support provided as needed.  Students
              work with mentors  from community businesses and agencies to solve problems in 
              staffing schedules, restaurant waiting line management, traffic  flow, bus
              routing and decision making protocols for trauma victims.   Discussion of
              issues in the ethics of science will use the case  study method.  Career
              activities will feature site visits and guest  speakers (especially African
              Americans).  Four quarterly Workshops  providing academic counseling, math
              review and a continued  introduction to community professionals who use
              mathematics in  their work will complete the project activities.  ***
