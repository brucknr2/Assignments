Abstract    :
              9353416  Denning    This 36 month project links a small rural North Carolina
              school  district to community, university and computational resources.  It 
              supports them in building curriculim units ties to local issues and  in
              training teachers to deal with the concomitant technologies.   Teachers are
              central to school change and become local mentors and  change agents supporting
              their colleagues in adopting computational  interdisciplinary approaches. 
              Initial plans target specific skills  taught in the context of wetlands, which
              are vital to the local  area.  A multi-grade sequence of activities is
              envisioned which  ties together the work of students in the elementary, middle
              and  high schools.  In the early grades, teachers and students focus on  simple
              simulations and viusual representations.  In the middle  grades, they deal with
              dynamic models and student representations.   In the high school, they work
              with numerical methods and  computational methodologies and have access to
              software on the Cray  at the North Carolina Supercomputing Center.  Eighteen
              K-12  teachers are trained in each of the first two years and 24 in the  third
              year.    The partners in the project include Elizabeth City State University 
              providing access to the network, equipment and technical expertise,  East
              Carolina University helping with curriculum change, teh North  Carolina
              Supercomputing Center training the staff in computational  science, and the
              N.C. Science and Mathematics Alliance extending  the goals of the state systems
              initiative to the Camden school  district.    Cost sharing is estimated at 45%
