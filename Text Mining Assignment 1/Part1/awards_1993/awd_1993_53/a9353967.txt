Abstract    :
              9353967  Wilkinson  Borough of Manhattan Community College has been a leader of
              the  Calculus reform movement. Their present precalculus, calculus  and
              differential equations curriculum emphasizes students  working in groups and
              using computer graphers and computer  algebra systems to create written honors
              projects and animated  mathematical movies. It adapts the model developed by
              Uri  Treisman at Berkeley to a large urban non-residential college,  and moves
              beyond the Treisman model in its strong emphasis in  technology and alternative
              assessment models.   This project  builds on their previous calculus curriculum
              projects.  They  are offering two regional summer faculty workshops for each of
               two summers. One workshop is for faculty inexperienced in  technology and
              focuses on the preparation of collaborative  computer portfolios in precalculus
              and calculus. The second  workshop for faculty more experienced in technology
              and is  emphasizing the use of new computer technology (e.g., Macromind 
              Director) that animates graphs, and allows students to create  mathematics
              movies in precalculus, calculus, and differential  equations.  ***
