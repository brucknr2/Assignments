Abstract    :
              SSC-9353214  Bank Street College  New York, NY    Hogan, Kathlen and Penberg,
              David    "Liberty Environmental Science Academy (LESA)    The Liberty
              Environmental Science Academy (LESA) will serve 40  African American and Latino
              rising seventh, eighth and ninth  graders from Community School District Three
              in Manhattan, which  includes Central Harlem.  All are part of Bank Street's
              Liberty  partnership program, a New York State-funded comprehensive college 
              preparatory program that stresses prevention through early  intervention.   
              LESA's residential, 20-day, intensive summer science experience  will take
              place at Bard College.  Developed and coordinated by the  Bronx Botanical
              Garden's Institute of Ecological Studies (IES),  field investigation will
              alternate yearly between a terrestrial and  an aquatic ecology focus.  Outdoor
              Biological Instructional  Strategies (OBIS) investigations will familiarize
              students with  organisms and their environments with activities centered on the
               physical environment, aquatic environments, and organisms, plants,  insects,
              and other invertebrates, birds, and mammals.  Mathematics  will be continually
              integrated into activities.  Students will  attend "Writing to Learn
              Mathematics and Science," and receive  career counseling.    During the school
              year, weekly Saturday Environmental Science  Clusters at Bank Street will
              involve LESA students in accessing  Learning Link, a national electronic
              network; using the Center for  Children and Technology's NSF-sponsored Imagine,
              a computer-based  environment; and participating in Wave Hill's natural area 
              restoration project.
