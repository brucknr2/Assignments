Abstract    :
              9353928  Ingargiola  The goal of this faculty enhancement workshop is to provide
               instructors in two and four year colleges an exposure to the  resources
              available to teach the undergraduate introductory  course in Artificial
              Intelligence.  The workshop will run for  six days during June 1994 followed by
              two one-day "reflection"  workshops in November 1994 and April 1995.  The major
              topics    addressed are (1) What resources are available and how they can  be
              obtained, (2) How to integrate classroom lectures with  laboratory sessions and
              assignments using available laboratory  materials and network facilities, (3)
              How to adapt or extend  the available pedagogic material, (4) How to improve
              learning  and cooperation between instructors and their students, (5) How  to
              establish and maintain cooperative arrangements between  instructors at
              different institutions, and (6) Ideas on how to  assess the effectiveness of
              various pedagogic methods for using  the resources.  A Teaching Portfolio will
              be developed that  includes material distributed by the instructors, materials 
              created by the participants for their own courses, and  suggestions by
              participants for further exploration.  ***
