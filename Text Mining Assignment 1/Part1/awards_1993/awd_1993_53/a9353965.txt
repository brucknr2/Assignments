Abstract    :
              9353965  Fuller  This project offers an undergraduate faculty enhancement 
              workshop for each of two summers, 1994 and 1995.  The purpose  of this project
              is to host two week workshops on Teaching  Physics Using Interactive Digitized
              Media.  Each workshop will:   i) foster a discussion and formulation of new
              strategies for  the teaching of physics using the capabilities of interactive 
              digitized media; ii) enable 30 physics professors to become  skilled in the use
              of interactive digitized media for teaching  physics courses for
              undergraduates; iii) help physicists  develop lessons that change the present
              physics content using  existing interactive digitized media software and
              technologies;  iv) prepare the participants to lead local, regional, or 
              national workshops on new science content using interactive  digitized media
              technologies; and v) make the interactive  digitized media lessons developed by
              the workshop participants  available to physics educators throughout the
              country.   ***
