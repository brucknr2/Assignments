Abstract    :
              9353912  Porter  This conference brings together a group of thirty college 
              teachers of mathematics and biology to learn about the content  and uses of
              difference and differential equations in modeling  problems of biology and
              ecology. Participants train on existing  software packages and in their use as
              classroom instructional  tools. The materials cover fundamental topics from
              both  difference and differential equations and how they are used to 
              understand problems in population dynamics and other related  biological and
              ecological areas. The goal is to modernize  undergraduate courses in which
              these topics can be a vital  part. Applications of mathematics to and from
              biology and  ecology are a main theme throughout the conference. Mornings  are
              devoted to lectures and demonstrations by the speakers.  Afternoons involve
              hands-on computer activities, problem  solving, modeling of biological
              problems, group discussions,  participant presentations and the construction of
              a module or  course outline. The conference is followed by class testing of 
              the module/outline along with models and computer activities  during the
              1994-95 school year. The reports are submitted to  the project director for
              distribution to all participants. Each  report will include a revised copy of
              the module/outline/other  activity along with an evaluation of classroom
              success. A  selection of reports will be distributed nationally.  ***
