Abstract    :
              9353839  Austin    Howard University seeks to provide enrichment experiences for
              a  four week commuter program in microbiology for 30 high-ability and 
              high-potential eighth and ninth grade students from the school  district of
              Prince George's (PG) County, Maryland. The program is  conducted by the Howard
              University Department of Microbiology in  the College of Medicine.  During the
              four-week period the students  will be introduced to concepts of microbiology
              and learn  experimental techniques from research scientists, university 
              professors, physicians and medical technicians. The students will  engage in
              small group discussions, participate in field trip  activities, and work on a
              research project.
