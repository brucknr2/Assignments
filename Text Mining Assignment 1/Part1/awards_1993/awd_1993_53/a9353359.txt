Abstract    :
              9353359  Schreck    This project is for teachers of science in grades 6 - 9. 
              The  participants will attend two, four week summer workshops in order  to gain
              an understanding of basic chemistry and physics concepts,  develop effective
              methods of teaching these concepts in an  integrated manner, and learn safe and
              appropriate methods of  operating science apparatus, as well as proper handling
              of  substances in classroom activities.  The workshops will features  content
              presentations, discussions, laboratory activities,  demonstrations, safety
              sessions, teaching practice, planning  outreach sessions and attention to
              interrelationships of these  sciences and technology. Emphasis will be placed
              on core topics   common to most middle  school curricula along with effective 
              methods for concept-based teaching using the teaching/learning  cycle,
              cooperative learning, and improved integration of these  sciences with other
              sciences and mathematics.  There will be  support offered for key physical
              science concepts supplemented by  specially prepared background briefs,
              featuring applications and  extensions of the topic.  The teachers will also
              get a chance to  practice with a group of students in the UNC science camp
              during  the summer.  The cost share is 11% of the NSF grant.   ***
