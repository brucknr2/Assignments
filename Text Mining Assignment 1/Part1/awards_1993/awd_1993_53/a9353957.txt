Abstract    :
              9353957  Bouldin  A five-day short course will be offered twice--once in 
              Knoxville, TN, and again in Sacramento. CA. The course  introduces new
              techniques for designing microelectronic systems  that rely on rapid
              prototyping using field-programmable gate  arrays (FPGAs). Thus, a design can
              be taken from initial  specification to a working implementation involving all
              the  steps in the design, debugging, and evaluation cycle.  Laboratory
              exercises  permit each participant to complete a  project that can be taken
              back to their home institution. Also,  each participant  receives a "starter
              kit" containing class  notes, reprints, sample completed projects and
              instructions on  how to obtain donations of vendor hardware and software.
