Abstract    :
              9353683  BELL    This conference will bring in at least 80 (K-12) science
              teachers  who will focus on methods for teaching science at the elementary, 
              middle, and high school levels.  They will also participate in  critical
              discussions about the methods.  Topics to be included are:   hands-on
              discovery-based learning; reflective teaching and action  research;
              cognitively-guided instruction; technology-based science  teaching; the
              relationship between laboratory and classroom work in  middle and high school;
              the role of textbooks in teaching science;   and the effect of school-based
              management on teaching practice.   There will be a distribution of the
              conference proceedings which  will cover plenary papers, summaries of the
              interactive sessions,  models of good practice presented by teachers, and an
              assessment of  what makes good practice and how to reinforce it.  The
              conference  is expected to have a total attendance of about 400 with a 
              composition of science educators, scientists, business people,  state and
              federal government policymakers, congressional staff, and  others for invited
              presentations and joint discussions.  ***
