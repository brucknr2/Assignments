Abstract    :
              9353079  Edwards    The Dallas Independent School District, in partnership with
              the  City of Dallas and its diverse communities, seeks to implement a  one year
              self study/planning grant which will result in a plan for  systemic change in
              science, mathematics and technology education.  Ten site-based School Centered
              Education (SCE) planning groups will  meet by area to conduct area self
              studies. Concurrent meetings of  identified stakeholders will assess the needs
              of higher education,  technical education and the workforce. The groups will
              meet to  identify and develop strategies that will result in an increase in 
              student enrollment and achievement in mathematics and science  classes and
              successfully impact those entering college and the  workforce. Recommendations
              from these groups will form the basis of  a comprehensive plan for systemic
              reform in the Dallas Independent  School District.  ***
