Abstract    :
              SSC-9353152  Harvey Mudd College  Claremont, CA    Tanenbaum, Samuel B   
              "Harvey Mudd College Summer Science Institute"    Harvey Mudd College request a
              three-year grant of $197,490 to  establish the Harvey Mudd College Summer
              Science Institute, a  commuter summer science program targeted to
              underrepresented  students in grades 7 and 8 from the surrounding local school 
              districts.  The five week program will offer students the  opportunity to
              explore five different science and engineering  topics in-depth, and give them
              hands-on experience in highly  motivating projects especially designed to
              excite the enthusiasm of  junior high students.  Students will also interact
              with  representatives from industry and selected members of the Harvey  Mudd
              faculty and student body.  Follow-up activities will be  organized during the
              academic year to further motivate the students  to continue their studies of
              science and mathematics, and  ultimately pursue careers in technical fields.
