Abstract    :
              9353992  Ganesan  The objective of this workshop is to both present a course and
               develop a problem workbook on air toxics and their control.  Offering such a
              course in this critical area for 20  undergraduate teaching faculty and
              involving them in developing  a workbook will significantly enhance their
              understanding of  the subject and also help them to develop new courses in this
               area. It is also a very cost-effective way to disseminate  information and to
              transfer technology. The workbook, problems  and solutions will be generated by
              an interdisciplinary  environmental team of engineering and applied science
              faculty.  Topics include: regulatory issues related to air toxics;  measurement
              and estimation of toxic emissions; control systems  for toxic particulates and
              gaseous emissions; pollution  prevention; economic considerations; health risk
              assessment,  management and risk communication, control analysis for  specific
              industries; ethical considerations; and, health/safety  and accident/emergency
              management. The first draft of the  problem workbook will be prepared during a
              two week (July 94)  summer workshop session in 1994. The 1994-1995 academic
              year  will provide an opportunity to class-room test the  effectiveness of the
              problems in the workbook. A three day  follow-up summer session in late June of
              1995 is scheduled at  Manhattan College in New York to provide an opportunity
              to  revise, update, and edit the workbook, and finalize production  and
              distribution plans for implementation in undergraduate  engineering and applied
              science curricula. This is a  collaborative effort between two four year
              undergraduate  colleges; Montana Tech in Butte, Montana, and Manhattan College 
              in Manhattan, New York.   ***
