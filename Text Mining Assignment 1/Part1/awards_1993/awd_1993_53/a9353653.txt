Abstract    :
              93-53653  Ballinger  Nebraska EPSCoR Experimental Systemic Initiative  This
              proposal outlines several specific initiatives that will  support the Nebraska
              EPSCoR office's  efforts to promote increased competitiveness in the research 
              programs of faculty of the four  academic research institutions in Nebraska. 
              The projects are  grouped into three general areas  of activity including
              travel associated with grant or collaborative  research opportunities, 
              disciplinary research conferences, and educational programs to  increase the
              number of women  and minorities in science disciplines.  Travel programs
              involve  opportunities for junior faculty  to visit program officers in federal
              agencies and to explore  collaborative research opportunities  in national
              research labs and industry.  Conferences include an  international conference
              in atomic  collisions physics, an intrastate conference in regulatory peptide 
              research, and possibly an  additional intrastate conference to stimulate
              increased  collaboration among scientists of the state's  four research
              universities.  Educational programs are focused on  engineering and biomedical 
              science at the pre-college level, biochemistry at the college  level, and water
              science at the  graduate level.
