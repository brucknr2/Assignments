              of Missouri-Kansas City             Kansas City,   MO     Enhancing the
              Teacher's Role in Assessment (EXTRA)    Project Overview:    This is a 3-year
              project of the University of Missouri-Kansas City  School of Education in
              collaboration with the Coalition for  Missouri Mathematics, the Missouri
              Council of Teachers of  Mathematics, the Missouri Department of Education, the
              University  of Missouri Video Network, the Mid-Continent Regional Educational 
              Laboratory, and 6 school districts.  The aim of the project is to  make
              mathematics teachers (grades 7-12) knowledgeable about, and  skillful in, the
              uses of modern assessment practices, and to  integrate such practices
              successfully into their teaching.  To  these ends, 40 teachers from 6
              ethnically diverse school districts  will be selected to participate in a
              3-year professional  development program consisting of two sequential academic
              year  institutes and summer workshops.  Communication between  participants and
              staff will be facilitated by a state-wide fiber  optic communication network. 
              An outreach program will begin in  Summer 2, when the original 40 participants
              will begin to help  project staff run institutes for some 120 teachers around
              the  State, again relying heavily on telecommunications.  By Year 3, it  is
              expected that some 200 teachers around the State will be  implementing modern
              assessment practices in their classrooms.  By  way of dissemination, the
              project will organize working groups of  mathematics educators from around the
              State to produce both a  handbook and a television course on modern assessment
              in  mathematics.  From its beginning, the project will be represented  by both
              participants and staff on the State's new testing  committee.
