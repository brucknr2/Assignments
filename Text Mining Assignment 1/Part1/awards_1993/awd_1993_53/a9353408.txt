Abstract    :
              9353408  Morrison    This five-year project will provide 120 secondary school 
              biology and chemistry teachers, from Indianapolis and rural  districts in
              Indiana, with workshop opportunities to gain  content knowledge and skills in
              using modern laboratory  instrumentation.  In three week summer workshops, ten
              two-  person teams of a biology and chemistry teacher from a  district will use
              analytical instrumentation common to both  disciplines and design laboratory
              curriculum modules using  the instrumentation in their classroom.  During a
              second  summer these same teachers will attend another two-week  workshop to
              learn new content, use of more instrumentation  and to resolve problems they
              have encountered in classroom  use of the instrumentation.  Teachers may earn
              nine-credits  for the first summer and six-credits for the second.    A
              Chemobile will support the summer activities during the  academic year.  It is
              a van equipped with the  instrumentation the teachers have used.  It will
              deliver the  instruments to local districts to support instruction in the 
              teacher's classroom.  Instrumentation in the van is provided  by Purdue
              University.  The van driver is a teacher qualified  to use the instruments and
              provide appropriate on-site  instructional support.  Indianapolis schools will
              be further  served by a Purdue Visitation Team composed of a university 
              faculty member and an industrial scientist.  The project  builds on an earlier
              pilot project which served a limited  number of chemistry teachers.  ***
