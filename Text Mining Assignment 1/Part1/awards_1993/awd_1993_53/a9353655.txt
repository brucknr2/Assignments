Abstract    :
              93-53655    Engstrom  Electronic Communication and Information Retrieval  The
              proposed project focuses on developing a state-of-the-art communication and
              information  retrieval system for the EPSCoR investigators in South Dakota. 
              New technology will be utilized  to overcome difficulties in effective
              collaboration caused by physically separate centers of  research within the
              existing clusters of the Advanced Development Program.  Three specific 
              activities will be implemented:  1) A telecommunications seminar series will be
              initiated over  the  recently inaugurated Rural Development Telecommunications
              Network; 2) All investigators  will be provided access to Internet and
              instruction in its use so that daily communication between  investigators,
              between the Project Director and investigators, and between investigators and
              their  colleagues outside of South Dakota can occur; 3) Investigators will be
              provided with access to  Uncover2, an information retrieval and document
              delivery service so that they can have the  research libraries of the country
              available to them.
