Abstract    :
              9353022  McCook    The University of Mississippi will initiate two, three-week 
              residential Young Scholars projects in life sciences for forty  students
              entering grades 10 through 12.  Student experiences will  include classroom
              lectures, field research, career counseling and  laboratory exercises.  The
              University of Mississippi Biological  Field Station will serve as an outdoor
              laboratory for research on  freshwater wetlands.  Students will gain research
              experience by  touring ongoing research projects at the field station. 
              In-depth  instruction on freshwater ecosystems will be provided by university 
              faculty.  Additional field trips to the National Forest Hydrology  Laboratory,
              National Sedimentation Laboratory and Sardis Reservoir  Dam are also provided. 
              The follow up activities, which include  data collection, research projects and
              classroom presentations,  complete the project.  ***
