Abstract    :
              9353052  Zimmerman    Boston University seeks to initiate a 6-week, residential
              and  commuter, Young Scholars project in Multi-disciplinary Science for  30
              students entering grades 12. The program, designed for high  ability students,
              enables students to participate in research  laboratories located at Boston
              University and MIT. The object of  the program is for the students to become
              aware of the realities of  a scientific career through involvement in research
              and research  methodology. The students will be paired with a faculty member
              who  will serve as a Mentor and assist the students as they explore  research
              problems in the sciences. Other experiences include field  trips and classroom
              discussions and seminars.
