Abstract    :
              93-53658    Connolly  Research Experiences for Undergraduate and Minority
              Students in Biology and Chemistry  The Kentucky Experimental Program to
              Stimulate Competitive Research proposes to initiate two  pilot programs to
              expand its activities into human resource development.  One of these programs 
              is an undergraduate enrichment program in biological sciences at the University
              of Kentucky.   The other is a minority fellowship program in chemical catalysis
              at the University of Louisville.    Each program will have at least equal
              matching funds provided by either the Howard Hughes   Medical Institute, the
              University of Kentucky, or the University of Louisville.  Each of the  projects
              is closely related to the research clusters already supported by the NSF/EPSCoR
                advanced development grant.  However, they represent a new direction for the
              clusters as they   are designed to encourage talented undergraduates to seek
              careers in biological research, and for   minority students to work in the
              commercially important area of chemical catalysis.
