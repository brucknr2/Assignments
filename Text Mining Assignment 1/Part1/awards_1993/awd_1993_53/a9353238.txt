Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project is a four-year program to enhance the teaching of life            
              and environmental science to deaf middle school and high school                
              students nationwide.  To accomplish this purpose, a four-week                  
              summer Institute will be held at Gallaudet University each summer              
              for four years, for a total of eighty-two middle and high school               
              teachers of the deaf.  The Institute will integrate the expertise              
              and facilities of the University science faculties and the Genetics            
              Services Center at the University as well as the Fish and Wildlife             
              Service and the Marine Science Consortium, of which Gallaudet                  
              University is a member.                                                        
                                                                                             
              The Institute will concentrate on the content areas of genetics,               
              physiology and environmental science with the major focus on hands-            
              on laboratory and field experiences.  Other topics to be covered               
              include:  teaching critical thinking, career information,                      
              techniques to improve teaching, and the use of educational                     
              technology.  Participants will be provided with a series of "take              
              home" lesson plans and will be expected to transfer relevant                   
              information and pedagogical skills to their peers.  Participants               
              will also be linked with faculty and staff and each other via a                
              computer conferencing system.                                                  
                                                                                             
              Cost-sharing equals 5.0% of the NSF award.
