Abstract    :
              9353787  Krane    We propose to develop a model program for an annual symposium
              for undergraduate women  majoring in science.  This symposium will provide them
              with information related to graduate  study in various disciplines of science,
              and it will also bring them into close contact with women  scientists.  We
              expect to be able to demonstrate that the knowledge and encouragement gained 
              from this experience not only increases the number of women who undertake
              graduate study in  science , but also will make them better prepared for
              graduate study and therefore more likely  to see it through to an advanced
              degree.    A pilot program along these lines was successfully held for 120
              undergraduate women in April  1992.  This program revealed several needed areas
              of development which require that the  symposium be repeated before an
              exportable model can be finalized.  This proposal requests  funding to continue
              the symposium for three years, which will permit us to accomplish the 
              following:  (1) The continuation will allow us to evaluate the success of the
              program over  several years and track the participants through a few years of
              graduate study.  (2) We will  develop a package of materials that the
              participants can take with them to enable them to stage  a similar event on
              their home campuses.  (3) We will design and disseminate this model to other 
              regions of the U.S. to enable them to establish similar programs.  ***
