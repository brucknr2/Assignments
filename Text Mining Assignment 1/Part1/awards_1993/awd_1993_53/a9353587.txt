Abstract    :
              9353587  Cobb    The three-year project brings together issues concerning
              students'  learning, teachers' activity, classroom interactions, and the 
              nature of instructional activities.  The primary focus is on the  role that
              students' models of their informal mathematical problem  solving play in
              supporting their transition to more formal yet  personally-meaningful
              mathematical activity.  As part of the  investigation, particular attention is
              given to both small group  work and to students' developing mathematical
              beliefs and values.   The research involves a series of classroom teaching
              experiments  conducted in collaboration with first, second, and third-grade 
              teachers.  The four instructional sequences used in these  experiments each
              last six weeks and address arithmetical topics  that are central to elementary
              school mathematics.  The analysis of  classroom video-recordings and children's
              written work coordinates  cognitive and social perspectives to clarify the role
              that models  can play both in individual learning and in classroom 
              communication.  The findings have immediate implications for the  design of
              mathematical learning environments that are consistent  with current reform
              recommendations.  Further, the four  instructional sequences that will be
              revised in the course of the  research are designed to all innovative teachers
              the so-called  basics via communications, reasoning, and problem solving.  ***
