Abstract    :
              9353084  HANCOCK    The project proposes to build on the success of the
              Tabletop, a  computer-based data tool which provides dynamic visual 
              representations for organizing, exploring and analyzing data.  A  Tabletop Jr.
              version, for grades 4 through 8, will be used as the  basis for training
              teacher leaders who will use the software in  their own classrooms.  The study
              of the pilot group will assist in  improving the draft version of the software
              and in disseminating  information and skills about its use among a second tier
              of  teachers.  A network (given the name, "Multilog") will facilitate 
              communication and provide support among all participants in the  process.  The
              anticipated outcomes include a marketable product  (Tabletop Jr.), a core group
              of 235 trained teacher leaders who  will, in turn, influence many more teachers
              in a continuing  dissemination process.  ***
