Abstract    :
              9353447  Hosoume    This project, sponsored by the University of
              California-Berkeley  (Lawrence Hall of Science), will develop, conduct and
              disseminate  a science and mathematics content and methods institute for 
              preschool and kindergarten teachers in the San Francisco Bay area  and the
              nation as well.  The curriculum is based upon the PEACHES  and GEMS materials. 
              Project activities include: introduction to  science and mathematical concepts
              through the life and physical  sciences; participation in hands-on sciecne and
              mathematics  experiences integrated with language arts; introduction to 
              appropriate instructional strategies for young children;  participation in
              early childhood professional conferences in the  area of science and
              mathematics and presentation of orientation  sessions on project curriculum by
              participants to teachers and  parents at their schools.  The project will
              develop and conduct 3  summer institutes, each three weeks in length and each
              enrolling 40  pre-school and kindergarten teachers.  In addition two academic 
              year sessions will be conducted each year for project participants  to carry
              out dissemination to the schools.  Fifty parents,  administrators and teachers
              from participants' schools will be  involved in one academic session each year
              at the Lawrence Hall of  Science.  The Handbook for Early Childhood Science and
              Math  Explorations for teachers and parents will be revised and published  by
              year four of the project.
