Abstract    :
              9353744  Harris-Perkins    The goal of the Fresno Unified School District
              self-study/planning  grant is to collect data and analyze existing policies in
              order to  develop a process for systemic change. The proposal seeks to  develop
              a system that will monitor and assess student achievement;  improve existing
              science and mathematics curricula; design a plan  for on-going professional
              development and collaboration with local  colleges; and establish the community
              as a classroom.    A Steering Committee consisting of key stakeholders and
              community  representatives will guide the planning process.  ***
