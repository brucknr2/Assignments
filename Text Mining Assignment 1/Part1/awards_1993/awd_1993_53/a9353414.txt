Abstract    :
              9353414  Henry    This conference grant of $74,340 to the Florida Council of 
              Mathematics is designed to prepare 40 members of the Florida  Mathematics
              Presidential Awardee Association (FMPAA) to serve as  mathematics education
              reform leaders, and to conduct outreach  conferences, particularly for small
              school districts in Florida.    Over twenty months of the project, there will
              be a leadership  conference for FMPAA members followed by five regional
              conferences  with many of the Awardees as conference presenters.  The
              leadership  conference for the Awardees will be planned in spring and conducted
               in summer, 1994.  During the 1994-95 school year, the grant will  provide
              support for the Awardees to serve as presenters in five  outreach conferences
              for teachers from small districts in Florida.   Each conference will be planned
              for an attendance of 75 teachers  from small districts with minimal mathematics
              education support for  a total of 375 teachers impacted by the pool of 40
              teacher leaders  prepared.    The evaluation of the conference grant will be
              done by evaluating  the five outreach conferences conducted, the dissemination
              of  examples of best practice through the outreach conferences, and the 
              monitoring of small district networking activities resulting from  each
              conference.
