Abstract    :
              9353030  Garbisch    The intent of this project is to prepare a guidebook for
              students  and teachers of grades 7-12 that will encourage, facilitate, and 
              guide the creation, enhancement and restoration of wetlands.  The  guide is
              expected to be about 150 pages in length and will be  divided into two parts. 
              Part I will provide information on the  common wetland types with integrated
              learning activities.  Part II  will include information on identifying
              potential sites for  implementing the project and will include the information
              necessary  to achieve these objectives.  The guide will also include 
              information on ecological functions, hydrologic regimes and plant  communities
              of wetlands.  It will provide an alternative for hands-  on projects that will
              result in a school yard habitat well suited  for student monitoring, research
              and instructional activities.  An  urban wetland restoration project will be
              selected to field test  the project.
