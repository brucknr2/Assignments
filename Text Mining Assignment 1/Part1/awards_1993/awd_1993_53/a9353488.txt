Abstract    :
              9353488  Akins  City College of City University of New York proposes to continue
               its Center for Analysis of Structures and Interfaces (CASI).  The  Center has
              two fundamental goals:  (1) to conduct exemplary  research and (2) to
              substantially enhance the involvement of  minorities in science and engineering
              in this Nation.  The center  has three research component subprojects
              including:  (1) the use of  light and its properties to study structure and
              dynamical processes  of aggregated molecules absorbed onto surfaces of
              different types  of materials, (2) the use of spectroscopies to investigate 
              structures and properties of mass-selected cluster beams syntheses  of
              clusters, and (3) the use of ultrafast laser techniques for  characterization
              and assessment of nonlinear properties of films  and semiconductors for
              electronic and/or photonic device  applications.    CASI was established in
              1988 with funding from the National Science  Foundation under the Minority
              Research Centers of Excellence (MRCE)  Program.  The CASI project meets the
              goals of the MRCE Program  especially (1) to increase the minority presence in
              science and  engineering by making substantial resources available to upgrade 
              the research capabilities of strong and productive minority  institutions, (2)
              to allow the institutions to continue use of  research as a tool to increase
              the effectiveness of related science  and engineering activities for minority
              groups in its region, and  (3) to provide opportunities for minority faculty
              and students at  City College and nearby institutions to engage in meritorious 
              research that leads to publications in refereed journals.  ***
