Abstract    :
              In the Fall of 1994 The New York Botanical Garden will  begin its second 100
              years of commitment to science education  with the opening of the Children's
              Adventure Garden and the  Children's Adventure Trails.  As two components of
              the  Children's Adventure Project , these informal science  education
              facilities will use  participatory discovery to  engage urban children and
              their families in learning botanical  science, inquiry skills, positive
              attitudes towards science,  and the methods of scientists.  In the 1.5 acre
              Adventure  Garden children will interact with living plants and  fabricated
              exhibits to discover fundamental principles of  plant biology; and in the one
              mile of Adventure Trails they  will closely observe interdependencies of
              complex ecosystems  using the framework of these fundamental principles.  To 
              expand visitor understanding of plant biology and the ways  that scientists
              study it, Investigation Stations, integral  components of each facility, will
              be placed so that visitors  will handle, sense, and observe living plants in
              situ and  interact with fabricated exhibits and scientific tools.  The  Project
              will be developed by NYBG staff educators and  scientists with on-going
              participation of a broad spectrum of  advisors and consultants, including
              exhibition designers,  evaluators, community school teachers, and environmental
               education specialists.  ***
