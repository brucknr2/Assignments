Abstract    :
              9353973  Brock  The UNCA Workstation Workshop is a two-week introduction to the 
              use of workstations in science, engineering, and mathematics  education. Each
              summer two workshops are held on the UNCA  campus. Participants addend one
              workshop.     The workshops are designed for faculty in smaller departments 
              who are starting to use workstations in their teaching and must  provide much
              of their own computer support. The goal of the  workshop is to show
              participants how to effectively utilize a  workstation connected to the NSFnet.
              In particular,  participants learn how to use Unix file utilities; write simple
               programs and command procedures; navigate the Internet; install  programs
              obtained over the Internet; solve classroom problems  using symbolic
              computation; assemble a reliable local area  network; and manage a small
              workstation laboratory.    The workshop is taught in a networked workstation
              laboratory in  which each student has his/her own workstation or X-terminal.  
              Teaching is highly interactive and frequently alternates  between lecture and
              lab.  ***
