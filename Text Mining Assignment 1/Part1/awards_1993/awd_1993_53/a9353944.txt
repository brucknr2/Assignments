Abstract    :
              9353944  Wyman  "Technology Strategies: Tutorials and Projects" involves 120 
              participants in one of four two-week workshops offered at The  Ohio State
              University in Summer 1994 and 1995. The workshops  include tutorials in
              mathematical topics, calculator use, and  software packages, but they emphasize
              extensive participant  projects that incorporate new technologies and teaching 
              methodologies culminating in presentations during the workshops  and at
              followup meetings.  These workshops build on the highly  successful Technology
              Strategies Workshops offered at Ohio  State with N.S.F. support in 1992 and
              1993. Faculty from two-  year and community colleges, four year colleges, and 
              universities are actively recruited.  Also, alumni from the  previous workshops
              are invited to attend the Tutorials and  Projects workshops. The Participants
              take home new insights on  the national curricular reforms that have developed
              in the past  five years, as well as renewed excitement and enhanced  technical
              skills.  As a result of the workshop, they will be  able to communicate this
              excitement to their students.   Proceedings volumes will be widely distributed
              and participants  are invited to submit papers for a refereed publication for 
              national dissemination.  ***
