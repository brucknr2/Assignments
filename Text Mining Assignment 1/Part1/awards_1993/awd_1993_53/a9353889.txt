Abstract    :
              9353889     Pogrow    The project focuses on helping at-risk middle school
              students  increase their mathematics performance through the development of  a
              new genre of software called Word Problem Processors (WPP).  A  WPP enables
              students to create  mental models of how to translate  language into
              mathematical procedures.  Students communicate in  writing with an imaginary
              creature in the computer which responds  to the language the student inputs. 
              In addition, mathematics  curriculum consisting of daily conversations that are
              coordinated  with the software are provided.  Specific mathematics concepts are
               introduced indirectly, through discussions of problems and issues  in highly
              motivating computer settings.  Content includes  estimation, geometry,
              statistics, probability, graphing,  measurement, ration, proportion, percent,
              algebra, relations, and  functions.  This discovery-based mathematics
              curriculum supports  the NCTM Standards, and emphasizes problem solving and
              problem  posing in a mathematical context.  Students who have low language 
              comprehension skills raise these skill levels.  Students can work  individually
              at a computer or in groups.  This project continues  and augments work done
              during award ESI-9054924.
