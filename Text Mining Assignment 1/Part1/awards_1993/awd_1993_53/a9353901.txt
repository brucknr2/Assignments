Abstract    :
              9353901  Friedman  A three week workshop Mathematical Modeling for 32 college
              and  university instructors will be held in the summer of 1994. The  general
              goal of the workshop is to provide mathematicians the  opportunity to use
              mathematical modeling to solve problems  which come from industry and
              engineering sciences.  The  participants will experience the excitement of
              solving  real-world problems (using a team approach), and be provided 
              background to offer undergraduate courses with modeling  components at their
              home institutions.  ***
