              New Haven Public Schools  New Haven, CT    "New Haven P.M.S.A. "Pathway"
              Project"    The New Haven Public Schools (NHPS) requests $2.5 million in NSF 
              funds for a five-year "Partnership for Minority Student  Achievement."  The
              project will increase minority student  participation in "gate-keeping" S&M
              secondary courses and NHPS  minority graduate enrollment in postsecondary SEM
              programs by a  factor of five.  The project will contain these elements: (1) 
              district-wide K-12 S&M curriculum reform; (2) significant expansion  of
              year-round minority student enrichment activities; (3) creation  of a District
              K-12 "path" for improved minority student achievement  (six Pathway Schools);
              (4) reallocation of technology and other  resources to strengthen instruction
              and student participation; and  (5) increased professional development and
              support for NHPS S&M  teachers at all levels.  Strong emphasis will be placed
              on  equitable gender participation, parent involvement, and role  modeling and
              mentoring for younger students.  The project will  focus on "hands-on,"
              interdisciplinary learning in the classroom  and complementary discovery
              approaches in a variety of K-12  enrichment activities.  Project partners
              include: five Yale  university schools and departments, Southern connecticut
              State  University, Gateway Community and Technical College, the New Haven 
              Chamber of commerce, the Connecticut Academy (CT SSE), the  Connecticut
              Pre-Engineering Program, the Eli Whitney Museum, the  Urban League, and the
              Center San Jose Center.  Bank Street  College's Center for Education and
              Technology will evaluate the  project.  A total of 3,928 K-12 students and 250
              teachers will be  served directly through the New Haven PMSA program. 
              Eighty-four  percent of NHPS students are African-American or Hispanic, 32 
              percent live in poverty.
