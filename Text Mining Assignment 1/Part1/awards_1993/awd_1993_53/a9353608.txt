Abstract    :
              PMSA-9353608  Memphis City Schools  Memphis, TN  Jones, Barbara    "Memphis
              Minority Mathematics and Science Achievement Partnership  Project"    Minority
              academic performance in mathematics and science is lower  in the southeastern
              United States than any other area.  With a  total of approximately 105,000
              students and 84,000 African American  students, the Memphis City School system
              is one of largest school  systems in that region as well as the United States. 
              Promising  solutions may be found in national experience and experimentation 
              within the Memphis City School system.  However, it is becoming  apparent that
              effective solutions must be comprehensive and ling  term.  Comprehensive and
              long term solutions require the  mobilization of community wide resources for
              systemic adoption and  the institutionalization of effective programming for
              the necessary  through time effort.    This project has three goals: 1) to
              increase enrollment and success  of minority students in mathematics and
              science courses; 2) to  increase minority enrollment in college and entry into
              mathematics  and science courses; and 3) to accomplish replication and 
              institutionalization of effective programming.   The project will  offer a
              comprehensive set of activities for student s, teachers,  and parents.  In its
              first phase, activities that have been  identified as potentially effective
              will be implemented in a set of  schools with 90% minority enrollments and
              2/3's of the Memphis City  School system's students and teachers.  Required
              community  resources will be mobilized through a collaborative led by memphis 
              City School that includes a historically Black college, a  comprehensive
              university, health sciences university, and a  nationally unique community base
              coordinating agency.  In its  second phase, effective activities will be
              identified and extended  systemwide based on the results of careful and timely
              monitoring,  assessment and analysis.  A "bottom up" strategy empowering 
              teachers and school site level staff  and a "top down" strategy  involving
              school system, higher education, community  representatives, and community
              political and business leaders will  be used to bring about systemic change.
