Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Researchers in mathematics education are writing foundational                  
              papers to be included in the new Conference Board of the                       
              Mathematical Sciences series RESEARCH IN COLLEGIATE MATHEMATICS                
              EDUCATION.  These papers serve both pure and applied purposes,                 
              contributing to the field of research in undergraduate mathematics             
              education and informing the direct improvement of undergraduate                
              mathematics instruction.  The dual purposes imply dual but                     
              overlapping audiences.  Papers focus on learning within particular             
              mathematical domains as well as on more general cognitive process              
              such as problem solving, skill acquisition, conceptual development,            
              mathematical creativity, and cognitive styles.  Papers also deal               
              with issues associated with variations in teaching methods, or                 
              classroom and laboratory contexts.  More broadly, research may                 
              address institutional arrangements intended to support learning and            
              teaching; for example, curriculum design, assessment practices, or             
              strategies for faculty development.
