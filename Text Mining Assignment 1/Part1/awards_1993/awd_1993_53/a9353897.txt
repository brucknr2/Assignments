Abstract    :
              9353897  Peters      Indiana University seeks to initiate an eight-week,
              residential,  Young Scholars project in Multi-disciplinary Science for 50 
              students from Indiana entering grades 11 and 12. The students will  learn about
              research methodology and career opportunities in the  various science fields
              through lectures, field trips, and hands-on  laboratory activities. Students
              will also work as apprentice  scientists under the auspices of University
              faculty. Throughout the  program, emphasis will be placed on philosophy and
              ethics of  science, careers in science and mathematics, and the 
              interrelationships of the various scientific areas.
