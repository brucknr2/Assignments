Abstract    :
              9353933  Hovanesian  This course will present the newest technologies of applied
               optics needed by college teachers of subjects which utilize  optics.  Digital
              and analog data processing, gaging, video  techniques, hologram interferometry,
              fiber optics, metrology,  canning methods, moire methods, photoelasticity,
              shearography  and others will be presented by experts.  The latest generation 
              of equipment will be available for planned hands-on  experimentation.  As a
              follow-on effort, the investigators will  assist the participants to implement
              these laboratory  experiments at their home institutions.         ***
