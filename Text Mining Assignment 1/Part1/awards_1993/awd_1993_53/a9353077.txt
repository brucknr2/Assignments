Abstract    :
              9353077   Butts    Using systemic reform in mathematics and science education as
              the  catalyst, the Atlanta Public Schools propose to initiate a self-  study
              planning process that will examine all aspects of its public  school education
              system. The effort will build upon the strong  partnerships that currently
              exist between the school system, local  businesses, service organizations,
              institutions of higher learning  and the Mayor's Office. The focus of the self
              study will be to  identify structural changes needed to significantly improve
              the  delivery of mathematics and science instruction to all Atlanta  Public
              School students. The study will identify steps that need to  be taken to effect
              comprehensive and coordinated improvement in  student achievement.     Six task
              forces, comprised of representatives from key stakeholder  groups, will gather
              data for the self study. This data will serve  as the basis for developing a
              five to seven year plan for revamping  the system's overall instructional
              program to produce not only  improved mathematics and science achievement, but
              to better  integrate instruction among all core disciplines. Critical 
              information will be used to initiate comprehensive change in the  Atlanta
              Public School System's overall instructional program.   ***
