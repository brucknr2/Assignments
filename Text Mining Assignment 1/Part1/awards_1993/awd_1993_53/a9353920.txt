Abstract    :
              9353920  Gwozdz  Workshops on microfabrication are provided for undergraduate 
              faculty. These workshops teach technology used for the  manufacture of
              integrated circuits and other miniature devices.  Hands-on laboratory
              experience, under the direction of experts  in the field, is emphasized.  The
              subject matter is highly  interdisciplinary, appropriate for faculty from most
              science  and engineering departments.  Workshops are particularly  appropriate
              for teachers of introductory courses in materials  science and engineering,
              electrical engineering, chemistry and  chemical engineering, and physics.  ***
