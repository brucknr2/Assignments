Abstract    :
                                                9353876  Watson    Texas A&M University seeks
              to initiate a three-week summer,  residential, Young Scholars program with
              follow-up activities  during the academic year for 32 female and minority
              students  entering grades 8 and 9. The students will engage in classroom 
              discussions, group activities, research projects, and field trips  in
              environmental science and engineering. The program is designed  to involve the
              students in a range of participatory activities that  will communicate the
              excitement of engineering inquiry, research  and problem solving and enhance
              their interest in considering  engineering as a career option.
