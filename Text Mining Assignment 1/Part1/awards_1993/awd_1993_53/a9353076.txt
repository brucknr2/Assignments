              Independent School District self study/planning grant will focus on five areas:
              (1) vision, (2) professional development (3) resources (4) learning
              opportunities, and (5) policy reforms. The self assessment process will address
              key educational issues, establish consensus and provide direction for systemic
              in mathematics and science education.  The study will begin by involving
              community task forces in town meetings, surveys and questionnaires.   Visions
              from San Antonio's 15 school districts will be developed and synthesized into a
              common plan that identifies of barriers and outlines implementation strategies.
                SAISD, key city stakeholders and current school partners will build upon
              successful education strategies initiated as a part of the City of San
              Antonio's    Target '90 Goals    strategic planning effort.  The self
              assessment will yield a report that will summarize baseline data and outline an
              action plan that addresses systemic reform of mathematics and science
              education.  ***
