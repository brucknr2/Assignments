Abstract    :
              9353090  Fisher    The Mathematicians and Education Reform Forum (MER) proposes
              to  institutionalize a program developed over the past 5 years.  The  mission
              of MER "...is to encourage and facilitate the involvement  of
              mathematicians...in K-14 mathematics education, and to promote  the
              professional recognition of educational work within the  mathematics
              community".  The dissemination effort for 3 years  focusses on: (1) workshops
              to facilitate change in the college  preparation of mathematics teachers; (2)
              establishing links between  MER and 7 professional mathematics organizations
              for the purpose of  bringing about change among the individual members of those
               organizations; (3) establishing and e-mail newsletter and network;  (4)
              holding a video teleconference; (5) publishing a newsletter for  5,500
              mathematicians; and (6) integrating the functions of MER with  the American
              Mathematical Society (AMS). The effort is guided by a  core group of four
              leaders and a steering committee of key national  figures.  ***
