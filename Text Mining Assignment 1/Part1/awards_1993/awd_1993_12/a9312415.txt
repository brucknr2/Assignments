Abstract    :
              9312415 Palmer  This proposal requests partial support for the Twenty first
              Annual Telecommunications Policy Research Conference, scheduled for October 2 4
              in Solomons, Maryland.  The Conference convenes national and international
              scholars in basic and applied research from engineering, economics, operations
              research, law, communications and information science, and public policy;
              leaders in communications and information industries; specialists from public
              interest organizations; and government policymakers.  Rapid growth in the field
              of communication and information science and policy  from initiatives in high
              speed networking to changes in the traditional approach to communications and
              information regulation  provides few opportunities for the research and public
              policy communities to exchange information.  Yet the significant interaction
              between national and international policy, on the one hand, and the successful
              development and improvement of communications and information technology, on
              the other, are critical.  The Conference seeks to facilitate communication of
              the results of the best available current basic and applied research on
              communications and information topics, and to foster the development of
              effective, coherent national and international communications and information
              policy.  The Conference also seeks to develop a salient basic and applied
              research agenda for emerging issues, to encourage interdisciplinary research
              early in the basic research process, and to integrate basic and applied
              research from other countries.  In addition, the Conference serves a highly
              effective educational role in informing and encouraging new young researchers
              in communications a nd information research policy.
