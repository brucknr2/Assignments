Abstract    :
              9312637  Huang    This is a three-year cooperative research project proposed by 
               Dr. Huey Huang, Rice University, and Professor Wen-guey Wu,  National Tsing
              Hua University.  Membrane fusion and lysis are two  key cell destruction
              processes utilized by viruses and toxins.   This project proposes to use Taiwan
              cobra venom to understand the  processes of membrane fusion and lysis.  Taiwan
              cobra venom  contains two biochemical components, cytotoxin (CTX) III and V. 
              The former causes membrane fusion, but exhibits little hemolysis  activity,
              while the latter induces significant hemolysis but  exhibits little fusion
              activity.  The contrast between these two  closely related small peptides
              provides a unique means for  studying the molecular mechanisms involved in cell
              destruction  processes.  Dr. Huang has experience in the structural biology of 
              membrane active peptides and proteins and has developed  innovative approaches
              to the problems of studying these  molecules, and his Co-PI in Taiwan has
              successfully purified the  Cobra Toxin peptides, CTX III and V. It is an
              excellent  cooperative study and can provide a good hands-on opportunity for 
              students in structural biology, as well as increasing their  understanding of
              the ecology and behavior of Taiwan cobra.  This  project is jointly supported
              by the NSF and the Taiwan National  Science Council (NSC).
