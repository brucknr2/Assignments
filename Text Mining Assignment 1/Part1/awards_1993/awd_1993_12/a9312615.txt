Abstract    :
              9312615  Carter    Agricultural liberalization in Madagascar has  had
              disappointing results: agricultural  production per capita has declined since 
              reforms began.  This dissertation research  project will attempt to explain in 
              microeconomic terms the fallacies in the logic  of liberalization which have
              produced these  unexpected outcomes.  The candidate,  Christopher B. Barrett,
              working under the  supervision of Prof. Michael R. Carter, of the  Department
              of Agricultural Economics, of the  University of Wisconsin - Madison, will
              collect  market-structure data on ten villages in one of  Madagascar's
              principal agricultural regions,  the Vakinankaratra area of the Central 
              Highlands.  The cooperating Malagasy  institution, the Centre d'Etudes
              Economiques of  the Universite d'Antananarivo, under the  direction of Dr. Pepe
              Andrianomanana, will  assist in identifying informants.  These data  will be
              analyzed in conjunction with existing  data already gathered from a variety of 
              sources, including an 825-household Malagasy  farm management study fielded in
              1990.  The  researcher will use the data to test a  microeconomic theory of
              peasant response to  risk in an imperfect market environment.      The
              conventional, reductionist approach, which  identifies prices as levels and
              represents  markets by price levels alone, predicts  relatively uniform
              producer response across  households.  The proposed approach would add  three
              intuitive insights to the conventional  model:  that prices are distributions,
              that  markets are not uniform in the way they  transmit price signals, and that
              farm-level,  non-price constraints bind differentially  across producers and
              commodities.  The  potential practical benefit would be a new  perspective that
              could improve the design of  agricultural liberalization programs.  ***
