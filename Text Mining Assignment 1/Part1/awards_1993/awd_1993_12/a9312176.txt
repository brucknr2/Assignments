Abstract    :
              9312176  Acrivos    This three-year award supports U.S.-U.K. cooperative
              research in  solid state chemistry between Juana Acrivos of San Jose State 
              University and W.Y. Liang of the Interdisciplinary Research  Center in
              Superconductivity, Cambridge University.  The objective  of their research is
              to determine how electronic properties of a  layer solid are controlled by
              intercalation.  Intercalation  compounds are formed by insertion of various
              elements.  These  compounds are used in the synthesis of LDS (low dimensional 
              solid) conductors and superconductors, materials for high duty  batteries,
              catalysts, and solid lubricants.    The U.S. investigator brings to this
              collaboration expertise in  the preparation of LDS and intercalated compounds
              and the  evaluation of their properties through magnetic resonance  techniques
              (NMR), diffraction techniques and optical  spectroscopy.  This is complemented
              by the British Center's  considerable expertise in high temperature
              superconductivity and  synthesis of new superconductors.  In this effort, the
              Center  will supply and characterize crystals for intercalation. The  project
              will advance our understanding of intercalation, an  increasingly important,
              efficient and novel method for  synthesizing new superconductors.  ***
