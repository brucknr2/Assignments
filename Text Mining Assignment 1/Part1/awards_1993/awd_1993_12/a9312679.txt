Abstract    :
              9312679   Bajzek       The advent of information services and the emergence of a
               set of information navigation and access tools (such as Gopher  and WAIS) have
              made the Internet more user-friendly and more  useful to novices, as well as
              enhancing its potential value to  veteran users.  Users do not yet receive
              maximum benefit from  these tools.       PREPnet plans to configure these tools
              to produce  environments that match the needs of its constituency groups.  We 
              believe that education and training coupled with the planned  information
              environment will make PREPnet more valuable to users.       Also, to improve
              the quality of its current connectivity  services and to plan to meet future
              demands, PREPnet needs to  gain a better understanding of performance-related
              factors, such  as availability, load, congestion, and delay.  Many midlevel 
              networks suffer from the lack of a freely-available,  standardized, low-cost
              package to gather, record, and process  aggregate performance statistics that
              can be compared with  statistics from other networks.       Prepnet proposes
              that NSF support a joint project with the  Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center to
              develop a set of tools,  application, and procedures for measuring network
              performance  that would be deployed by PREPnet and other midlevel networks.
