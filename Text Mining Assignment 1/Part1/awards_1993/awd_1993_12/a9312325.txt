Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT -- CTS-9312325  PI -- Michael F. Modest    While laser processing
              (drilling, cutting, welding) is gaining industrial importance at an extremely
              rapid pace, the basic process remains poorly understood, largely because of a
              dearth of knowledge of high-temperature property data (of the material being
              processed, and of the laser plume forming above it).  Sophisticated models
              exist that could accurately predict drilling rates, hole diameter, taper,
              cutting rates, etc., were it not for this lack of property data.  This proposal
              addresses three groups of experiments, which will be carried out to measure all
              relevant high-temperature properties for CO2 and Nd:YAG laser processing of
              ceramics:  (1) The absorptivity of several ceramic specimens (at the laser
              wavelengths, as a function of temperature), the ablation temperature, and the
              energy required to ablate material will be measured in an integrating sphere
              apparatus.  (2) The laser interaction zone will be imaged through high-speed
              photography and infrared thermometry to capture the removal mechanism
              (ablation, decomposition, melting, or micro-explosive removal) and to identify
              debris removal and redeposition.  (3) Absorption coefficients of the laser
              plume will be measured at the laser wavelengths (to determine amount of beam
              blockage) and in the mid-infrared (to determine re-emission from the plume)
              using transmission and emission spectroscopy.  Results from this investigation
              will allow quantitative predictions for laser processing of ceramics, and will
              provide experimental designs to measure the relevant properties for other
              materials, including metals.
