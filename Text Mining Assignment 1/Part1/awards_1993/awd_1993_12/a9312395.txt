Abstract    :
              9312398  Dean       The project will address problems in building integrated 
              planning and learning systems for applications in mobile robotics,  such as
              errand running, surveillance, target following, and  searching for objects of a
              specified type.  These applications  require robots to work under uncertainty,
              complexity, and time  pressure.  Solutions to the associated control problems
              require  efficient algorithms for directing movement and sensing to acquire 
              information about the environment.
