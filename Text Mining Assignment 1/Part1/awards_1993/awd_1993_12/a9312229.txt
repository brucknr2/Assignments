Abstract    :
              Professor Paik will continue his program of research in  experimental
              gravitational physics.  His group will design  and construct electromechanical
              transducers to measure  extremely small signals in current and future
              gravitational  wave detectors.    Professor Paik's devices will be used in the
              new receiver  nearing completion at Stanford University.  He will also  carry
              out a design for transducers associated with a large  spherical detector
              planned for the future.
