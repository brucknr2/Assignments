Abstract    :
              This interagency transfer of funds is part of an agreement between             
              NIH, NSF and AID to jointly fund three projects for five years, each           
              with three interwoven components: drug discovery, biodiversity                 
              conservation and economic development.  Each funded project will               
              seek to make biotic surveys in developing areas with the purpose of            
              simultaneously inventorying biological diversity, screening suitable           
              elements of that diversity for natural pharmaceutical products and             
              translating the results of this effort into economic potential for             
              the inhabitants of the host areas.  NIH will administer this                   
              cooperative research program for the three agencies, thus                      
              necessitating this interagency transfer.
