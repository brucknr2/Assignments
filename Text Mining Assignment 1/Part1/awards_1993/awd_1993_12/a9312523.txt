                             9312523 Veronis  This proposal is for the exploration of
              theoretical ideas of processes that influence large scale ocean circulation. 
              These theoretical studies are partly analytical and partly numerical.  They are
              to be supplemented with experiments on the effects of topography on flows which
              simulate large scale ocean circulation on a rotating turn-table in the
              laboratory.  In addition, an experimental study is proposed to determine the
              influence of the magnitude of the heat and salt anomalies on the height of salt
              fingers in the laboratory.      :
