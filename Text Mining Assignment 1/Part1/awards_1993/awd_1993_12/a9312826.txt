Abstract    :
              9312826  DEUSER    This study will continue time-series particle-flux
              measurements at  depths of 500, 1500, and 3200 m in the Sargasso Sea for three 
              years. The 3200-m series presently extends over 15 years. It is by  far the
              longest series of its kind.  Together with the hydrographic  time series at
              nearby Station "S" and with the growing number of  JGOFS time-series
              measurements (BATS) in the immediate vicinity  this work will continue to
              provide a data base on physical,  chemical and biological variables in the open
              ocean.  Over the  years this time series has demonstrated the existence of
              temporal  variability in the deep ocean, revealed the efficiency of processes 
              removing materials from the surface ocean, and documented many of  the effects
              of those processes on the chemistry and biology of the  deep ocean.  A search
              for a successor PI will be continued along  with maintaining the series and all
              associated analytical work as  well as identifying  the forcing functions of
              carbon flux to the  deep ocean, assessing decade-scale trends in the efficacy
              of the  "biological pump", and monitoring transport of anthropogenic 
              components to the deep ocean.
