Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will examine how the Tzeltal and Tzotzil Maya                     
              experience, diagnose and treat mental disorders.  A period                     
              of 24 months will be spent collecting data that will address                   
              interrelated concerns within three domains: (1) traditional                    
              Maya ethnopsychiatry, (2) the relationship of the Maya                         
              ethnopsychiatric model to the Western biomedical psychiatric                   
              model, and (3) medical pluralism and hierarchy of resort of                    
              treatment of mental disorders.  An ethnoepidemiology survey                    
              will be central to the project.  This survey will establish                    
              the prevalence and cultural definition of the mental                           
              conditions under study, form the basis for screening of                        
              cases in subsequent stages of the research, and for                            
              recruitment of self-identified cases of recognized folk                        
              disorders.  Focus on the experiences of the sufferers of                       
              mental disorders has yet to be undertaken in this region and                   
              will provide valuable information on the afflictions, the                      
              system of ethnomedical practice, the beliefs which direct                      
              treatment choice, the dynamic relation between belief and                      
              behavior, and the relation between the indigenous and                          
              biomedical systems.  The use of the Western psychiatric                        
              assessment instruments (e.g., Computerized Diagnostic                          
              Interview Schedule) will provide comparative information on                    
              cultural variation in psychological disorders.  Importantly,                   
              knowledged gained about Maya disorders and their definition                    
              and treatment will allow public health officials to more                       
              effectively design treatment strategies for the Maya.
