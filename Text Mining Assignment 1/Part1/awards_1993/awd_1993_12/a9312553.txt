Abstract    :
              9312553  O'Hanlon    This award provides funding for the first year of a
              three-year  continuing award under the "Self-Sufficient Partnership for 
              Research" Program at the University of Arizona's  Industry/University
              Cooperative Research Center for  Microcontamination Control.  The Center
              continues to meet the  renewal criteria requirements of the I/UCRC Program.    
               Additional funds are provided by the Department of Energy's  Environmental
              Restoration and Waste Management to obtain a non-  voting membership in the
              Center.    The Program Manager recommends the University of Arizona be awarded 
              $40,000 for the first year of a three-year continuing award.  An  additional
              $10,000 is recommended for one year with funding  provided by the U.S.
              Department of Energy.    Near the end of each 12-month period, the Program
              Manager and/or  the Division Director of the Engineering Education Centers
              Division  will review the progress of the Center on a number of renewal 
              criteria requirements, including the following:  1) the extent to  which the
              university/industry interaction is developing; 2) the  extent to which the
              support base is developing; and 3) the extent  to which a robust research
              program is developing.  If the review is  satisfactory, the Program Manager
              will recommend support for the  next period of this continuing award.
