Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award is to support an initial workshop and additional                    
              collaborative activities between US and Portuguese scientists. The             
              focus is on specific coastal oceanographic research that are common            
              to and of major interest and importance to Portugal and the US. The            
              theme of the first workshop will be the important oceanographic                
              processes that affect living resources in the coastal oceans. This             
              activity is being supported by the Division of Ocean Sciences and              
              the Division of International Programs.
