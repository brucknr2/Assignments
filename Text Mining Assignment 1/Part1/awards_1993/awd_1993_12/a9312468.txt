Abstract    :
              9312468  Shapiro  This theoretical and computational research is funded under
              the  Research at Undergraduate Institutions and Research Enhancements  for
              Undergraduates programs.  Multiple-interaction molecular  dynamics simulation
              techniques and computer visualization  techniques will be used to study: (1)
              electronic excitation and  inelastic energy loss effects in ion-surface
              collisions; (2)  fragmentation properties of cluster-surface and
              cluster-cluster  collisions and their sensitivity to interatomic potentials;
              (3)  material modification and thin-film deposition effects caused by  cluster
              impacts with energies in the electron-Volt to kiloelectron-  Volt per atom
              range; (4) isotopic sputtering effects from liquid  alloy targets; (5) dimer
              ejection in sputtering from alloy targets;  (6) collisional de-excitation
              effects following energetic ion  bombardment of alkali-halide surfaces; and,
              (7) differences in  surface topography effects initiated by single-ion and
              cluster-ion  bombardment.  This work will be carried out at California State 
              University at Fullerton in collaboration with the Basic and Applied  Science
              Group at Caltech and the Surface Physics Group at the  National Institute of
              Standards and Technology.  The research will  extend the fundamental
              understanding of ion-surface and cluster-  surface collision phenomena, guide
              future experiemntal work and  involve promising young undergraduate students in
              the process.  %%%  ***
