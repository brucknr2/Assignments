Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Under a Small Grant for Exploratory Research, a proof-of-                      
              concept experiment is to be conducted. The concept is that                     
              unexpected phenomena can occur under certain conditions in the                 
              interaction between a body and a vortex convected from                         
              upstream past that body. In particular, it has been predicted                  
              theoretically that a vortex may become trapped briefly near                    
              the body by large transient forces induced in the interaction.                 
              An experimental search is planned for such trapping, for the                   
              case of a cylindrical obstacle.                                                
                                                                                             
              Verification of the physical reality of the predictions would                  
              open a variety of opportunities for flow control.
