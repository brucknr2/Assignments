Abstract    :
              9312795  Dwoskin    The purpose of this program is to support an
              interdisciplinary  team of young American and Polish scientists who will
              conduct  research and develop models related to energy demand forecasting  and
              conservation assessment, and their applications for policy  development.  The
              investigators' joint analyses should contribute  to an assessment of energy
              intensity trends and potential  reductions in Polish energy demand by sector,
              and structural  changes in the Polish economy and associate implications for 
              energy demand.  Poland offers unique opportunities to examine a  variety of
              energy conservation regimes and technologies tailored  to the transition from a
              command to market economy, with  potential applicability to the entire region. 
              The United States,  concerned about unstable energy prices, uncertain oil
              supply, and  adverse impacts on the environment from fossil fuel use, has also 
              been compelled to reexamine its energy and environmental  policies.
