Abstract    :
              9312424  Sturrock       This is a research project to study periodic modulation
              of  solar flare activity and the distribution of major flares on the  solar
              surface.  Past studies have indicated that all observed  periodicities in
              sunspot activity are subharmonics of a fundamental  25.5 day periodicity.  If
              this assertion is proven, then  considerable insight into the nature of the
              solar interior will be  gained.  The study on distribution of solar flares is
              based on the  observation that major flares tend to be concentrated in "hot 
              spots" which typically exhibit rigid rotation rather than the  expected
              differential rotation characteristic of the solar surface.   The investigators
              will analyze sunspot data to further elucidate  the behavior of these hot
              spots.  Sunspot data to be used in the  study include observations made by the
              Greenwich Observatory and  the Kitt Peak National Observatory.  ***
