                    9312537 Krishnamurti "Numerical Weather Prediction Over the Tropics"     
                   Dr. Krishnamurti will continue research on a number of topics relating to
              the improvement of numerical weather prediction in tropical regions. 
              Specifically, five broad tasks will be pursued under this award.  The first is
              physical initialization which involves ensuring that the initial description of
              the atmosphere as represented in the model thermodynamic fields at the
              beginning of a forecast is consistent among various physical processes   that
              is, the humidity fields, rainfall, clouds, etc. are consistent with the earth's
              radiation balance.  Representing clouds in large numerical models is complex
              and difficult.  The second task involves the testing and comparing of two
              promising cloud schemes.  The third and fourth tasks involve research on
              improving forecasts of two tropical phenomena   the tropical cyclone and the
              large scale monsoon circulation.  Finally, the PI and his colleagues will
              continue an investigation of the low frequency portion of the monsoon
              circulation and the characteristics of the energy exchanges that are required
              to maintain the circulation.  Each of these tasks will contribute to the
              overall improvement of numerical prediction over tropical regions which, in
              turn, contributes to improve global predictions. ***
