Abstract    :
              9312726 Lu We propose to create Ge on GaAs waveguides in the mid infared.  This
              novel waveguide offers high density and compact optical wiring in analogy with
              current electronic integrated circuits.   High density is considered to be well
              over 10,000 components per square centimeter of surface.  Optical wiring, or
              waveguides, are considered to be compact if their dimensions are much smaller
              than the wavelength.  We are investigating here refractive index ratios of 4.0
              to 1 with Ge waveguides confined by an air cladding.  This high index ratio
              allows unprecedented control and confinement of the light.  The problem in this
              approach is primarily one of design as tight confinement requires the waveguide
              component development to be rethought entirely in terms of waves rather than
              the usual paraxial ray optics. The use of high index ratios to create high
              confinement is applicable to all wavelenghts from microwave to the visible.  We
              will perform our tests of components with microwave models, and create useful
              devices in the mid infrared using 10 micrometer wavelengths.  The design
              results of the mid infrared components ae applicable to visible and near
              infrared integrated optics using, for instance, GaAs waveguides with AlAs
              cladding.   ***
