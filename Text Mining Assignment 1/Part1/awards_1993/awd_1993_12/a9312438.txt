Abstract    :
              9312438  Edil    Technical Narrative:    This U.S.-Turkey collaborative research
              project  involving civil engineers from the University of  Wisconsin at Madison
              and Yildez University in  Istanbul, Turkey will address a fundamental 
              infrastructural problem, that is, prediction and  mitigation of excessive
              settlement resulting from  construction and rehabilitation of earth  structures
              founded on soft ground.  Long-term  field settlement data are very and
              difficult to  collect and consequently are very scarce.  Such  data have been
              collected in connection with the  construction of Alibey Dam in Turkey since
              1969.   The objective of this project is to use the  Alibey Dam data in
              analyzing long-term settlement  of soft ground.  Project funding will enable
              Dr.  K. Ozaydin and Mr. S. Ozcoban of Yildiz  University to work with Dr. T.
              Edil at the  University of Wisconsin-Madison.   Additionally,  Dr. Edil will
              visit Dr. Ozaydin's laboratory and  work with his team at the dam site. 
              Successful  completion of this effort is expected to verify  the validity of
              certain new concepts of soft  ground compression and contribute to the world 
              literature on the subject.     This project in civil engineering fulfills the 
              program objective of advancing scientific  knowledge by enabling leading
              experts in the  United States and Turkey to combine complementary  talents and
              pool research resources in areas of  strong mutual interest and competence.
