Abstract    :
              9312023  Svestka    The investigators will analyze X-ray imaging data of the sun
               obtained by instruments on the Yohkoh satellite.  The purpose of  the study is
              to investigate the properties of giant post-flare  arches which represent an
              important coronal phase of the most  eruptive flares on the sun.  The Yohkoh
              soft X-ray whole-Sun and  large field-of-view images, with excellent angular
              resolution offer  a real breakthrough in the information about these structures
              which  have energy comparable to those in coronal mass ejections.  The  study
              will address several problems related to these giant arches:  their internal
              structure, their magnetic fields, the location of  the footpoints of giant
              arches in the underlying magnetic field,  the time of onset of a coronal arch
              and its mode of formation, the  vertical and lateral time dependence of the
              process, the physical  conditions in the elementary components of the arch, the
               association between giant arches and eruptive flares, the  difference between
              stationary and growing arches, and the  conditions for coexistence of
              quasi-stationary giant arches with  eruptive coronal mass ejections in the same
              active region.  The  theoretical investigations will be conducted in
              collaboration with  Japanese scientists.  ***
