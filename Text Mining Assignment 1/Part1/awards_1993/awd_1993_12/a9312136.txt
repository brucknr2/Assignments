Abstract    :
              9312136  Silevitch    This award provides funding for the first year of a
              three-year  continuing award under the "Self-Sufficient Partnership for 
              Research" Program and to support an evaluator at Northeastern  University's
              Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for  Electromagnetics Research.
               The Center has demonstrated successful  research support from industrial
              members and has met the review  criteria of I/UCRC Program.      Funding is
              also provided to support an evaluator at the Center to  continue the evaluation
              responsibility on the monitoring of the  industry/university interaction within
              the Center.      Additional Funding is provided by the U.S. Army Natick RD&E
              Center  to augment a membership in the Center and to support ongoing  research.
               Funding is also provided by Rome Laboratory to obtain a  membership in the
              Center and to examine the electromagnetic  dynamics of high temperature
              superconductors in the microwave and  millimeter wave frequency ranges.     
              The Department of Energy's Environmental Restoration and Waste  Management
              Office has provided funding to obtain a non-voting  membership in the Center. 
              Additional funding is provided for a  woman undergraduate student to aid the
              Center in its's ongoing  research activities.        The Program Manager
              recommends Northeastern University be awarded  $58,000 for the first year of a
              three-year continuing award;   $63,672 for one year with funds provided by Rome
              Laboratory;   $25,000 for one year with funds provided by the U.S. Army Natick 
              RD&E; $10,000 for one year with funds provided by the Department of  Energy;
              and $5,000 for one year with funds provided by the Women,  Minorities, and
              Disabled Engineering Research Assistants Program.    Near the end of each
              12-month period the Program Manager and/or the  Division Director of the
              Engineering Education Centers Division  will review the progress of the Center
              on a number of renewal  criteria, including the following:  1) the extent to
              which the  university-industry intera ction is developing; 2) the extent to 
              which the support base is developing; and 3) the extent to which a  robust
              research program is developing.  If the review is  satisfactory, the Program
              Manager will recommend support for the  next period of this continuing award.
