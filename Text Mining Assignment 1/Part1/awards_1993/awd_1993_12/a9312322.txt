Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The long term goal of this research is to elucidate the molecular              
              mechanisms that regulate fruit abscission in higher plants. It has             
              been documented that cellulase (beta, 1:4 glucan glucanhydrolase)              
              increases in the abscission zone of Phaseolus vulgaris during leaf             
              fracture. It is also known that this increase in cellulase activity            
              can be accelerated by the addition of exogenous ethylene. A cDNA               
              clone, complementary to bean cellulase mRNA has been recently                  
              isolated and messenger RNA complementary to it has been shown to               
              increase dramatically in the abscission zone several hours after               
              ethylene treatment of bean. The kinetics suggest that other                    
              cellular events precede cellulase appearance in signalling                     
              abscission. One approach to identifying the mechanism through which            
              ethylene promotes fruit abscission is to examine those genes which             
              respond rapidly to externally applied ethylene. Dr. Klein proposes             
              here to isolate and characterize ethylene responsive genes that are            
              rapidly induced in the abscission zone and examine their expression            
              during fruit abscission in tomato.
