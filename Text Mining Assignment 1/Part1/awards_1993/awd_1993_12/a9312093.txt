Abstract    :
              9312093  Mayr  This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic 
              Chemistry Program supports research on metal-carbon triple  bonds by Dr.
              Andreas Mayr of the Chemistry Department, State  University of New York at
              Stonybrook.  Emphasis will be placed  on two projects: 1) coupling reactions of
              alkylidyne ligands  with other terminal ligands, and 2) reactions of metal 
              alkylidyne complexes with unsaturated organic substrates.  The  carbon-carbon
              bond-forming steps of alkylidyne-carbonyl and  alkylidyne-alkylidyne coupling
              reactions will be studied in  detail.  The feasibility of coupling alkylidynes
              with  thiocarbonyl, nitrosyl, and imido ligands will be explored.  Alkylidyne
              complexes containing sigma-bonded eta-1-hydrocarbon  ligands, such as alkyl,
              aryl, and vinyl, will be synthesized  and methods to induce the migration of
              the hydrocarbon ligand  to the alkylidyne will be tested.  In the second
              project, the  basic conditions for carbon-carbon bond formation during 
              reactions of alkylidyne metal complexes with alkenes and  alkynes will be
              studied.  %%%  The general goal of this research is to develop new ways to 
              form carbon-carbon and carbon-heteroatom chemical bonds, and to  understand the
              role transition metals play in mediating their  formation.  The results will
              provide a basis for developing new  organometallic reagents for organic
              synthesis and provide  models for proposed mechanistic steps of catalytic
              processes,  such as reductive polymerization of carbon monoxide,  hydrocarbon
              skeletal rearrangement, and hydrocarbon  hydrogenolysis.  Novel organometallic
              compounds will be  synthesized in the course of the research.  ***
