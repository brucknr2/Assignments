              9312911  Kesler  This proposal requests $5,000 to pay room and board for 
              students and assistant professors to attend the Gordon  Conference on
              Geochemistry of Hydrothermal Ore Deposits.  Support would be provided on a
              matching basis only to those  people who can cover their own travel expenses
              from other  sources.
