Abstract    :
              9312083  Shaw  Opportunities to examine the evolution of contract terms or of 
              firms' choices of contractual structure have been rare.  This  research project
              represents one such opportunity.  For the first  time, there exists a panel
              data set on about 1000 individual  franchisors for the period 1980 to 1991. 
              This project uses this  unique data set first to reexamine the hypotheses that
              have been  tested on franchising based on cross-sectional data only.  It  will
              be shown that the estimates obtained using these data only  are  biased because
              of omitted variables and sample selection  problems.  Second, systematic
              evidence is developed on the  evolution of the terms of franchise contracts,
              and the choice of  contract mix, overtime or as the chain expands.  This
              research is  important because it will not only shed new light on better 
              understanding of this important and growing form of business  organization, but
              also on long term contractual arrangements and  on vertical integration
              relationships.  ***
