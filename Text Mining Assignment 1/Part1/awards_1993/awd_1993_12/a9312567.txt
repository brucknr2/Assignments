Abstract    :
                    ABSTRACT    P.I. Erik Trinkaus/Robert Franciscus   SBR-9312567    A major
              controversy in anthropology surrounds the relationship (if any) of modern
              Europeans to Neanderthals, who lived in Europe from about 100,000 to 30,000
              years ago.  Some claim the Neanderthals were ancestors of Europeans, while
              others say the Neanderthals were exerminated by the invading ancestors of
              Europeans. Recently, this old controversy has once again been energized by a
              similar argument about the origins of modern people everywhere - whether there
              was a world-wide replacement of earlier, more primitive sorts of humans by
              modern invaders out of Africa, or whether there was a gradual shift towards
              modernity everywhere (the "replacement" vs. "regional continuity" theories).   
               This dissertation project provides for a detailed comparison of nasal anatomy
              among fossil and modern human crania, which will aid in resolving this issue. 
              The face and nose are widely recognized as being key indicators of population
              relationships, and this study will utilize the major extant examples.  It is a
              very well conceived project, and the graduate student to be supported is
              already known as an interesting figure in the field.   ***
