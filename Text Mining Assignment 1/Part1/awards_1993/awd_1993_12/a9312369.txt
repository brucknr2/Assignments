Abstract    :
              9312369  Svoronos  This project is on research to  develop a novel adaptive
              modeling  approach for periodic bioprocesses.   This approach, which combines 
              mechanistic models and neural  network models, will be used to  develop control
              algorithms.  These  models will also be used to optimize  the process with
              respect to the  manipulated variables.  The  techniques developed will be
              tested  on a newly constructed wastewater  treatment plant which utilizes the 
              Bio-Denipho Process for nutrient  removal.  ***
