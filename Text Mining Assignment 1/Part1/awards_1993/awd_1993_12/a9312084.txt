Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This grant will support a U.S.-Russia Workshop entitled                        
              "Fundamental Aspects of Self-Propagating High-Temperature                      
              Synthesis (SHS)"which will be held in Honolulu, Hawaii,                        
              November 3-6, 1993.  Significant advances have been made                       
              in recent years in the research and development of high-                       
              performance materials for technological needs using self-                      
              propagating high-temperature synthesis (SHS).  SHS is a                        
              unique process based on solid-state combustion using                           
              internally generated chemical energy.  Recognized experts in                   
              the field in both Russia and the U.S. will (1) discuss state-of-               
              the-art research results, and (2) identify specific topic ares                 
              upon which collaboration(s) may be built.  This workshop                       
              will link the two research efforts that have essentially been                  
              conducted in parallel for more than fifteen years.  In                         
              addition, this workshop draws its participants from a variety                  
              of U.S. institutions, and includes several younger researchers                 
              (<40 years of age) from both sides.  The bulk of the                           
              published research on SHS is from the former Soviet Union                      
              ?FSU!, and particularly from Russia.  Much of the remaining                    
              work has been conducted in the U.S.  Recent political events                   
              have opened the door for a Russia/US collaboration in basic                    
              SHS research that would not have been possible three years                     
              ago.                                                                           
                                                                                             
              This workshop in SHS fulfills the program objectives of                        
              advancing science by enabling leading experts in the U.S. and                  
              Russia to combine complementary talents and pool research                      
              resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
