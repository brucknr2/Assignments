Abstract    :
              This award provides partial support for the Gull Lake Nuclear                  
              Physics Conference on Giant Resonances to be held August 17 - 21,              
              1993 at the Kellogg Biological Research Center in Gull Lake,                   
              Michigan.  The conference will convene all active researchers,                 
              theorists and experimentalists, in order to present and discuss                
              the latest results and to stimulate and suggest future research.               
              The requested funds will support participants, who would make                  
              important and valuable contributions to the conference, but who                
              would not be able to participate without any financial                         
              assistance.
