Abstract    :
                   Climatic records show that polar regions have demonstrated an             
              amplified response to global climate change through geologic time.             
              Additionally, polar regions have significant influence upon global             
              climate processes and conditions.  Clouds also have been cited                 
              repeatedly as a critical factor in climatic change.  The early                 
              Eocene appears to have been a time of warm polar conditions, but               
              climate modeling efforts have been unsuccessful in reproducing                 
              these conditions.  To date, Eocene seasonality characteristics                 
              reconstructed from proxy data have been unsatisfactorily explained             
              by model scenarios of high atmospheric pCO2 or by warm high                    
              latitude ocean surface temperatures.  However, proxy data                      
              interpretations may be explained by the presence of warming clouds             
              at high latitudes.  We have hypothesized that polar stratospheric              
              ice clouds may have occurred in the early Eocene and produced a                
              dampened seasonal cycle at high latitudes.  Here we propose to test            
              this hypothesis by using an atmospheric general circulation model              
              to test the sensitivity of high latitude climates to the presence              
              of such polar clouds.  Of paramount interest will be temperature               
              seasonality of polar climates with and without such clouds.  We                
              will examine the polar cloud mechanism for both poles, thereby                 
              testing the cloud influence on a water-covered pole surrounded by              
              land masses and on a continentally-capped pole surrounded by ocean.
