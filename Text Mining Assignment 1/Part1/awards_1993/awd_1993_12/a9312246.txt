Abstract    :
              9312246  Heskett    This three-year award supports U.S.-Sweden cooperative
              research  in surface science between David R. Heskett, University of Rhode 
              Island, and Jesper Andersen, University of Lund, Sweden.  The  objective of
              their research is to investigate alkali atoms that  are adsorbed on metal. 
              They will use high resolution core level  photoemission spectroscopy.  The U.S.
              investigator brings to this  collaboration expertise in the properties of the
              adsorbate atom.   The project takes advantage of complementary expertise of the
               Swedish investigator and provides access to a synchrotron  radiation source
              not available in the United States currently.    Alkalis are widely used in the
              chemical industry as promoters for  catalysts. They are also used in many
              devices and processes which  require the emission of electrons either
              thermally, chemically or  by photoemission.  This research could provide a
              basis for new  and improved uses of alkalis adsorbed metals in industry.  ***
