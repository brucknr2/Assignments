Abstract    :
              9312547  Bekey    This award provides funding for the first year of a three-year
               continuing award under the "Self-Sufficient Partnership for  Research" Program
              at the University of Southern California's  Industry/University Cooperative
              Research Center for Manufacturing  and Automation.  The Center is composed of
              two core universities,  the University of Southern California and the
              University of  California, Los Angeles, and three affiliated universities, the 
              University of California, Irvine, Arizona State University and  California
              Institute of Technology.    The Center was initially supported by a group of
              companies through  a non-profit organization, Institute of Manufacturing and 
              Automation Research.  This Institute recently has merged with  another, the
              Computer-Aided Manufacturing International.  The name  for newly joined
              organizations is "Consortium for Advanced  Manufacturing-International."  The
              Center will be the research  component of the new organization.    Funding for
              the first year of a three-year continuing award for an  evaluator to study the
              industry/university interaction occurring in  the Center is also provided.   
              Additional funding is provided by the U.S. Department of Energy's 
              Environmental Restoration and Waste Management Office to obtain a  non-voting
              membership in the Center.    The Program Manager recommends the University of
              Southern  California be awarded $58,000 for the first year of a three-year 
              continuing award (includes $8,000 for an evaluator).  An additional  $10,000 is
              recommended for one year with funds provided by the U.S.  Department of Energy.
