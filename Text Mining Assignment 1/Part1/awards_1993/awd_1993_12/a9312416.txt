Abstract    :
              9312416  Zhou       This award is for experimental studies of electroweak 
              symmetry breaking.  These efforts are concentrated on the search  for the
              neutral Higgs boson of the minimal standard model.  They  include data analysis
              with the L3 detector at CERN and  simulations of the Higgs boson search at LEP
              200 and the SSC.   Continuing searches for the Higgs boson using the LEP L3
              detector  and further studies of Higgs detection methods with the GEM 
              experiment at the SSC will be carried out.  ***
