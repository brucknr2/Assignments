Abstract    :
              The proposed research is directed toward the exposition of hadron              
              structure, both at the nuclear and meson levels.  Photon and                   
              hadron beams will be used to excite sub-nucleon currents in                    
              proton and few-nucleon targets.  The measurements to be performed              
              include Compton scattering, meson production and nucleon knock-                
              out reactions on few-nucleon systems at (1232) energies, and                   
              exotic-meson and baryon resonance production with high energy                  
              beams at BNL and CEBAF.
