Abstract    :
              9312085  Niciejewski    This two-year award supports U.S.-Ireland cooperative
              research in  aeronomy between Rick J. Niciejewski of the University of 
              Michigan, and Frank Mulligan of St. Patrick's College, Maynooth,  Ireland.  The
              objective is to enhance their collaborative  investigations on neutral winds
              and temperatures in the  mesosphere and lower thermosphere by using data from
              an existing  array of four interferometers. Specifically, the investigators 
              propose to incorporate a detector for the Fabry-Perot  interferometer at
              Maynooth, Ireland and to add telecommunication  capabilities to the
              instruments.  This will permit real time  access to experiments from the
              University of Michigan.  Graduate  students at the University of Michigan and
              St. Patrick's College  will be trained on the instruments.      Winds and
              temperature in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere  have been difficult to
              observe and understand, yet, they are  intricately tied to global change.  The
              interferometers are  crucial for providing ground measurements for
              interpretation  of observational data from satellites.  The proposed
              measurements  will occur during the current Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite
               mission.  ***
