Abstract    :
                9312200  Davis    This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation
              Program   will assist the Department of Chemistry at the  University of  
              Arkansas-Fayetteville in the purchase of a Fourier transform   infrared (FT-IR)
              spectrometer. This instrument will enhance the   research in a number of  areas
              including the following:    1)  The structure and reactivity of molecules
              interacting with   transition metal atoms, clusters and surfaces,    2)  The
              adsorption of alkyl groups on metal surfaces in catalytic   processes,    3) 
              Dynamically modified, biospecific optical fiber sensors based   on a
              hydrophobically associated reagent phase,    4)  The study of molecular
              self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) and   high ordered surfaces with controlled
              chemical composition,    5)  Characterization of structure (ex situ) and
              composition of   liquid crystals SAMs.    %%%       A Fourier transform
              infrared (FT-IR) spectrometer is used to   obtain information about molecular
              structure and molecular   dynamics. It is also very useful in detecting the
              presence and   physical state of some functional groups (e.g. CO groups, OH  
              groups and others).  ***
