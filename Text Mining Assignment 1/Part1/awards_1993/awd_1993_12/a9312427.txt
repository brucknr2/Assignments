Abstract    :
                   This award is for a planning grant to determine the interest              
              of industry in joining a satellite I/UCRC to the established I/UCRC            
              for Optoelectronic Circuitry presently in operation at the                     
              University of Arizona.  This satellite I/UCRC is planned for the               
              University of Maryland and will complement the activities of the               
              I/UCRC at the University of Arizona.  The focus of the proposed                
              I/UCRC at the University of Maryland will be Optoelectronic                    
              interconnect and packaging.                                                    
                   The Program Director recommends an award of $10,000 for one               
              year be awarded to the University of Maryland for the planning                 
              grant.
