Abstract    :
              9312029  Spano  A theory for the nonlinear optical response in quasi-one- 
              dimensional systems, such as electron-donor-acceptor crystals,  halogen-bridged
              mixed-valence transition metal complexes,  polysilanes and molecular
              J-aggregates will be developed in an  effort to better understand the roles of
              energy transfer versus  charge transfer in systems with varying degrees of
              diagonal and  nondiagonal disorder.  Charge and excitation delocalization
              affects  the magnitude and size dependence of the nonlinear optical response 
              in profoundly different ways.  In the initial phases of the  research,
              noninteracting electron and mean-field Hamiltonians will  be used to obtain an
              analytical expression for the third order  optical response.  Beyond mean-field
              theory, numerical calculations  will be conducted on finite chains and
              extrapolated to the crystal  limit.  This new grant is funded jointly by the
              Division of  Materials Research and the Chemistry Division.  %%%    A
              theoretical research program funded jointly by the Division of  Materials
              Research and the Chemistry Division will be initiated to  calculate the
              nonlinear optical properties of quasi-one-dimensional  materials.  A thorough
              understanding of these materials, in the  bulk limit, is necessary in order to
              apply them to various photonic  devices.  ***
