Abstract    :
              9312363  Arhangel'skii       The main objective of this project is to understand
              how  closely countably compact spaces or groups of countable tightness 
              resemble compact spaces or groups.  The project is organized  around instances
              of the following two general questions: Which  results on cardinal functions of
              compact spaces generalize to  countably compact spaces, and under which
              conditions do the  latter properties (at least consistently) already imply 
              compactness of the space?  Which results on compact spaces and  continuous
              mappings can be generalized to countably compact  spaces if the space is a
              topological group (and the mapping is  also a homomorphism)?       The concept
              of compactness of a topological space lies at  the heart of General Topology;
              it is its most important idea from  the point of view of applications.  In
              order to understand the  notion of compactness fully, one has also to study
              weakenings of  the compactness property.  Perhaps the most important such 
              weakening is a property called countable compactness.  The aim of  the project
              is to determine which theorems about compact spaces  and continuous functions
              between compact spaces remain valid if  the spaces in question are only assumed
              to be countably compact  instead of compact.  A similar investigation will be
              done for  topological groups, that is, for spaces which in addition to the 
              topology also carry the structure of an algebraic group.  ***
