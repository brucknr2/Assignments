Abstract    :
                  9312355  Barber    This project will investigate primary production and 
              photosynthetic  parameters during the course of a year in  the monsoon
              dominated Arabian Sea.  The project is a  component of the U. S. Joint Global
              Ocean Flux Study (JFOGS)  effort called the Arabian Sea Process Study.  The
              Arabian  Sea is a low latitude oceanic region with strong and  reversing
              monsoon winds together with relatively modest  seasonal variability in solar
              radiation and sea surface  temperature.  The strong episodic wind forcing is 
              accompanied by large changes in nutrients and massive  phytoplankton blooms
              with high primary productivity.  The  objectives of the project are to 1)
              determine the seasonal  and spatial pattern of variability of primary
              production  using in situ and deck incubations in order to understand  the
              processes  that control both total  production and  export production; 2)
              determine the seasonal and spatial  pattern of the photosynthetic parameters
              incubations to  understand the effect of environmental covariables such as 
              nutrients on these parameters; and 3) use the newly  determined photosynthetic
              parameters in bio-optical models  to improve estimates of primary production
              and compare these  model estimates with our direct observations of primary 
              production.  ***
