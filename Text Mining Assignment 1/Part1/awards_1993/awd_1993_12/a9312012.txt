              Proposal: 9312012 ABSTRACT Date: 06/08/93   PI: Richey Institution: Pennsylvania
              State University    The preparation of main-group organometallic compounds will
                be developed, and the structures and reactions of these   compounds will be
              elucidated. One portion of the research   will be directed to new strategies
              for synthesizing   organometallate anions and coordinated organometallic  
              cations. The procedure involves the conversion of one   organometallic
              compound, with a suitable coordinating agent,   to a coordinated organometallic
              cation, and in the process, a   negative group is transferred to a second
              organometallic   compound to give an organometallate ion. In a second portion  
              of the work, mechanisms of reactions of organomagnesiate and   organozincate
              species with ketones will be studied. The   third portion of the research will
              develop new synthetic   procedures for organomagnesiate ions and determine  
              structural features of these ions.   %%%  This grant from the Organic Dynamics
              Program supports the   continuing work of Professor Herman G. Richey at  
              Pennsylvania State University. New strategies will be   developed for the
              synthesis of organometallic compounds   where the metal ions (magnesium and
              zinc) carry a negative   charge. The structures of the organometallic species
              will be   determined by x-ray and spectroscopic methods. Reactions of   these
              organometallic compounds will be investigated, where   particular attention
              will be paid to new synthetic   applications.  ***
