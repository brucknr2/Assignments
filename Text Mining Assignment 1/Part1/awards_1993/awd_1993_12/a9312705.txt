Abstract    :
              This proposal is to support a special issue of IEEE Transactions on            
              Plasma Science and a related international workshop on plasma                  
              astrophysics.  The Special Issue on Space and Cosmic Plasma will               
              provide an update on research in space plasma physics in the areas             
              of magnetospheric/ionospheric interactions, the magnetospheres of              
              the planets and stars, and the physics of plasma effects related to            
              other astrophysical objects.  Special emphasis is placed on                    
              laboratory and computer simulation of space plasmas and the                    
              application of these results to outstanding problems such as                   
              dynamical processes, energy transport, diagnostics, plasma                     
              diffusion in the magnetopause, nonlinear interactions, particle                
              acceleration, double layers, critical ionization velocity effect,              
              electric currents, and instabilities in the near-Earth plasma                  
              environment.  The goal of the Second IEEE Workshop on Plasma                   
              Astrophysics is to provide an update on research in space plasma               
              physics in the areas listed above for the Special Issue.  The solid            
              foundation that the solar system provides to plasma physics can be             
              extrapolated to plasmas having large-scale astrophysical and                   
              cosmological interest.
