Abstract    :
              9312971  Magnanti       This research will investigate complexity issues for the
               variational inequality problem.  This is a new research direction  that aims
              to:  (1) provide new theoretical insights and a better  understanding for a
              very general class problem, as well  as for  several of its specializations and
              applications, and (2) create new  algorithms and algorithmic approaches for
              variational inequalities  and related problems.  Variational inequality
              problems (VIP)  provide a natural and efficient framework for unifying the 
              treatment of equilibrium problems encountered in areas as diverse  as
              economics, game theory, transportation, and regional science.   Moveover,
              variational inequalities encompass a wide range of  generic problem areas
              including mathematical optimization (linear  and non-linear), complementarity,
              fixed point, and equilibrium  problems.  The investigation aims to address
              several questions  concerning the complexity of variational inequality
              problems:  (a)  What is the most general subclass of VIPs that are solvable in 
              polynomial time?  (b) What is the complexity of VIPs or of VIPs  with special
              structure? (c) What is the relationship between the  complexity of computing
              equilibria and fixed points and the  complexity of algorithms for VIPs? (d) Can
              duality results for VIPs  suggest new efficient algorithms?  (e) What
              algorithms for VIPs are  efficient in practice?       Building upon many of the
              ideas used in recent research, this  investigation will draw upon methods
              developed in the past decade  in studying the complexity of linear and
              nonlinear programming  (e.g. potential function methods, volume estimates,
              duality  results) as well as other results from mathematical analysis such  as
              convergence properties of nonexpansion maps.
