Abstract    :
                   This award is to conduct the annual NSF Design and                        
              Manufacturing Grantees Conference.  The conference will involve                
              researchers from the Division of Design and Manufacturing Systems              
              and the Division of Engineering Education and Centers, both located            
              within the Directorate for Engineering, and the Division of                    
              Information, Robots and Intelligent Systems, located within the                
              Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering.              
              The conference ensures that the individual researchers are informed            
              about the ongoing activities of their colleagues.  An elimination              
              of duplication of their efforts may be achieved and a degree of                
              cooperation may result from this activity.  An overall improvement             
              of efficiency of the research activity could be expected.  In                  
              addition, the conference program organization allows for ample time            
              to discuss manufacturing research in detail with the collective                
              research community at the meeting, with feedback to and input from             
              the National Science Foundation.  Finally personal contacts between            
              the grantees and program directors in the Divisions should                     
              contribute to clarifying many current issues in their work.                    
                   The aims of the conference are to enhance communication                   
              between researchers, encourage joint research, promote synergism,              
              and develop networks for technical interchange.  Attendees to the              
              conference gain an early access to the information disseminated.
