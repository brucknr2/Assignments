Abstract    :
              Fagin         The objectives of this research are:  1.     a quantitative
              analysis of the computational requirements of  multimedia, and  2.     the
              development of new system architectures based on this  analysis.         The
              methods to be employed are:  1.     Performance analysis of multimedia
              applications on a 100  Mb/s fiber optic network of workstations,  2.    
              Performance comparisons of solid-state and conventional disk  storage in
              client-server networked video applications,  3.     Computational profiling of
              existing standard multimedia  algorithms,  4.     The evaluation of prototype
              designs using FPGA (field-  programmable gate array) emulation, and  5.     The
              construction and evaluation of complete board-level  systems at the Thayer
              Rapid Prototyping Facility.
