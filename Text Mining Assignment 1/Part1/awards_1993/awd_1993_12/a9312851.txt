Abstract    :
              9312851  Maragakis      This  research is a study to perform full-scale tests 
              of  double  angle  railway  bridge  connections and  evaluate  their  fatigue 
              strength by monitoring the development and propagation of cracks.  A  fatigue 
              reliability  model will be  developed  based  on  the  fracture mechanics
              approach.  A detailed finite element model  of  the connections will also be
              developed.    New connections as well as connections from older railway bridges
               will  be  tested.   These connections will  be  supplied  by  the  American 
              Association of Railroads (AAR) which  has  expressed  a  strong  interest  in
              the project and will be cooperating  in  the  investigation.  ***
