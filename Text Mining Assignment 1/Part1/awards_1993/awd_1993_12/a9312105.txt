Abstract    :
              9312105  Cruickshank  This award provides funds to support the participation of
              graduate  students, junior scientists, and distinguished U.S. and foreign 
              scientists in the Gordon Conference on "Solar Plasma Physics and  MHD
              Processes", to be held at Plymouth State College, New  Hampshire, August 9-13,
              1993.  This is a follow-on to a highly-  successful conference held at Plymouth
              two years ago.  It is  generally accepted that fluid dynamical and plasma
              physics  processes lie at the heart of solar physics.  The interdisciplinary 
              aspects of solar physics are encouraged in the organization of the  conference
              which includes members of the laboratory plasma physics,  and fusion physics
              communities as well as solar and mangetospheric  physicists.  ***
