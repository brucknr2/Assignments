                          9312046 Granick  This award will support a cooperative research
              project between Professor Steve Granick, Department of Materials Science and
              Engineering, University of Illinois, and Professor Takeji Hashimoto, Department
              of Polymer Chemistry, Kyoto University in Japan.  During a seven month visit
              Professor Granick will conduct research on the viscoelastic effects on polymer
              phase separation processes specifically on the nucleation and growth mechanism.
                Recent work in solutions has concerned a single polymer system, polystyrene
              in dioctylphthalate (DOP) in which the scattering effects are large.  In such
              phenomena, not enough attention has been paid to the possible importance of
              nucleation.  Little is known about systems away from the critical composition. 
              The researchers will undertake joint measurement of turbidity and viscoelastic
              effects at various hydrostatic pressures.  This will involve investigation of
              polymer polymer shear induced demixing under extremely well defined conditions
              of shear rate, pressure, and polymer microstructure.    Results of the research
              are expected to lay the groundwork for new directions in nonequilibrium
              structure and phases of liquids research.  It will also contribute to a greatly
              expanded teaching curriculum.  Professor Granick is a leading researcher in the
              area of dynamics of macromolecules on surfaces.  Professor Hashimato has a
              reputation as being one of the best experimental polymer scientist s in Japan
              and has also developed a worldwide reputation in his area.  Professor Hashimoto
              has spent many years developing the unique specialized equipment that will be
              used in the research.  It is the intent of the researchers that they will
              continue their collaboration for many years through the exchange of graduate
              students in each other's laboratories.  This project is supported by the NSF
              CGP (Center for Global Partnership) Science Fellowship Program.
