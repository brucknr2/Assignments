Abstract    :
              Subtitle D of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act                       
              (RCRA), effective 9 October 1993, sets new minimum design                      
              standards for Municipal Solid Waste Landfill Facilities                        
              (MSWLF); requiring design of these facilities for a peak                       
              horizontal ground acceleration with a probability of                           
              exceedance of 10 percent in 250 years.  The seismic response                   
              of MSWLF has received very little study and is poorly                          
              understood.  Little guidance is available for an engineer on                   
              the performance of these facilities during strong ground                       
              shaking.  With the introduction of these Federal standards,                    
              the seismic design of landfills has taken on increased                         
              significance.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              The objective of this project is to measure insitu the small                   
              strain shear wave velocity profile at MSWLF to depths of 25                    
              to 30 meters, at 6 MSWLF sites in the Los Angeles basin,                       
              using the spectral analysis of surface waves (SASW)                            
              technique.  The sites are chosen to provide a representative                   
              spectrum of the conditions likely to be encountered in                         
              practice.  SASW is a non-intrusive geophysical measurement                     
              technique which is ideal for use at landfills, as it                           
              eliminates the health and safety problems associated with                      
              the soil borings required for conventional cross hole and                      
              down hole shear wave velocity measurements.  For this                          
              research, a unique large mass Controlled Source Spectral                       
              Analysis of Surface Waves (CSSASW) device will be used.                        
                                                                                             
              The shear wave velocity profiles that result from this                         
              research program will be an invaluable aid to engineers and                    
              scientists analyzing the seismic response of MSWLF.
