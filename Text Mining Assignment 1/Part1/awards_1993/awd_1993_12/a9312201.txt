Abstract    :
              9312201  Kolawa  Silicon carbide is an attractive material for high-temperature,
              high power, and high frequency electronic devices.  It is also used in
              fiber-reinforced metal-matrix composites.  For both electrical and composite
              applications, the reaction between the metal and silicon carbide and the
              resulting interfacial structure is of great concern.  The reactions between
              thin metal films and SiC will be studied to provide the basis of facts and
              understanding that is necessary for the judicious choice of metal-SiC contact
              for SiC electronic devices.  The reaction products, their evolution in time and
              with temperature, as well as their microstructure, will be studied using mainly
              backscattering spectrometry, X-ray diffraction and transmission electron
              microscopy.   The I(V), C(V), and contact resistivity measurements will be used
              to characterize a contact electrically.  Complete electrical contacts with a
              diffusion barriers included for stability will be developed and tested. 
              Adhesion, fracture, toughness and stress will be measured to characterize
              mechanical properties of the reacted layers and their interface with SiC
              substrate.  The proposed research will greatly benefit both electrical and
              metal-matrix composite applications.  ***
