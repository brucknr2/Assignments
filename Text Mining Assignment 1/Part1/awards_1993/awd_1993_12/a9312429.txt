Abstract    :
              Several chemical reactions which involve highly reactive,                      
              short-lived intermediates will be examined. The role of                        
              these intermediates will be probed with time-resolved                          
              absorption spectroscopy and photoacoustic calorimetry. Two                     
              major goals will be pursued. First, these techniques will be                   
              applied to reactive intermediates which include 1,1- and                       
              1,4-biradicals and their oxidation products, 1,1- and 1,4-                     
              biradical cations. Second, the results will be used to                         
              understand what factors are important in determining how                       
              these intermediates are converted to products. Factors such                    
              as substitution, temperature, method of generation, and                        
              solvent will be considered, which will provide insight into                    
              how structure and thermodynamics affect their reactivity.

              This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the                      
              continuing work of Joshua L. Goodman at the University of                      
              Rochester. Key reactive intermediates in organic chemistry                     
              will be studied that have two formal bonds to carbon                           
              (carbenes or 1,1-biradicals) and three formal bonds (1,4-                      
              biradicals). In the latter instance, two such carbon centers                   
              are found in an intermediate. These intermediates will be                      
              probed by spectroscopic and calorimetric means on a short                      
              time-scale. The results will provide an understanding as to                    
              what factors determine the products from these                                 
              intermediates.
