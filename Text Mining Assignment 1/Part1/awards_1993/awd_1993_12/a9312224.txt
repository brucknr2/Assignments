Abstract    :
              9312224  Braun    In prior work, we have studied concurrent visual task
              situations in  which the observer directs visual attention at one part of a
              visual  scene, thus leaving other parts unattended, but attempts to judge 
              attributes of both the attended and unattended parts of the scene.   These
              experiments have demonstrated that a significant amount of  information,
              especially about salient objects, can be discriminated  in unattended regions
              of the field of view.  Here, we formulate a  hypothesis which could explain
              these observations, and propose to  test it psychophysically.  This hypothesis
              is based on our earlier  proposal that a "saliency map" guides visual
              attention.  Our new  hypothesis it states that the saliency map provides a
              rudimentary  but functional alternative to visual attention, and that it can 
              sometimes mediate nonattentive stimulus selection, nonattentive  figure-ground
              segregation, and nonattentive access to awareness.   To test this hypothesis,
              we propose to conduct experiments on  unattended but salient objects,
              investigating feature  discrimination, as well as feature conjunctions and
              other "binding"  phenomena.    Ongoing research in our laboratory, supported by
              the NSF grant "An  integrated, neurally based model of selective, visual
              attention,"  (BIR 92-14238), aims to build a model of visual attention and the 
              saliency map at the systems level, on the basis of neurally  plausible
              elements.  The psychophysical experiments proposed here  will help to guide
              this effort and will help decide what perceptual  phenomena (grouping, feature
              conjoining, apparent motion, tracking)  should be our benchmarks in evaluating
              the model.***
