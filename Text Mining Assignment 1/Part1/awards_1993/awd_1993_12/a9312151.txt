Abstract    :
              9312151  Booton    This award provides funding for the first year of a
              three-year  continuing award for the "Self-Sufficient Partnership for Research"
               Program and support of the evaluator at the University of Colorado,  Boulder
              Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for  Microwave and Millimeter
              Wave Computer-Aided Design.  The Center  continues to meet the renewal criteria
              requirements of the I/UCRC  Program.    Additional funding is provided for a
              woman undergraduate student to  aid the Center in its ongoing research
              activities.    Funding is also provided by the Central Intelligence Agency
              (CIA)  to obtain a membership in the Center and to augment ongoing  research. 
              The Department of Energy's Environmental Restoration and  Waste Management
              Office is providing funding to obtain a non-voting  membership in the Center.  
               The Program Manager recommends the University of Colorado, Boulder  be
              awarded:  $57,242 for the first year of a three-year continuing  award; $5,000
              for one year with funds provided by the Women,  Minorities, and Disabled
              Engineering Research Assistants Program;  $50,000 for one year with funds
              provided by the CIA; and $10,000  for one year with funds provided by the U.S.
              Department of Energy.    Near the end of each 12-month period, the Program
              Manager and/or  the Division Director of the Engineering Education Centers
              Division  will review the progress of the Center on a number of renewal 
              criteria, including the following:  1) the extent to which the 
              university-industry interaction is developing; 2) the extent to  which the
              support base is developing; and 3) the extent to which a  robust research
              program is developing.  If the review is  satisfactory, the Program Manager
              will recommend support for the  next period of this continuing award.
