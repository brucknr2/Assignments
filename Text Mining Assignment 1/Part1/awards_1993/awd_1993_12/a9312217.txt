              This US-Russia workshop on Organometallic                                      
              Chemistry and Catalysis will be held August 18-                                
              21, 1993 at Northwestern University, Evanston,                                 
              Illinois prior to the national meeting of the                                  
              American Chemical Society in Chicago.  It was                                  
              organized by Michael Doyle, Trinity University                                 
              and Dr, Mark Vol'pinm Boreskov Institute of                                    
              Catalysis, Novosibirsk, Russia, after a                                        
              delegation of chemists visited Russia in the Fall                              
              of 1992.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              The subjects for the workshop are of critical                                  
              scientific significance in both countries;                                     
              opportunities for mutual cooperation and                                       
              collaboration in these areas are substantial.                                  
              Twelve participants from each country will                                     
              discuss the present status of basic research as                                
              well as the future needs for industrial                                        
              development, linkage and cooperation.  There will                              
              be further contact with US chemists when the FSU                               
              participants attend the American Chemical Society                              
              meeting following the workshop.                                                
                                                                                             
              This workshop in organometallic chemistry and                                  
              catalysis fulfills the program objectives of                                   
              advancing science by enabling leading experts in                               
              the US and Russia to combine complementary                                     
              talents and pool ideas in the areas of strong                                  
              mutual interest and competence.
