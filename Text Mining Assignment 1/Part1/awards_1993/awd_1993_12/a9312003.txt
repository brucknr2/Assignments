Abstract    :
              9312003  Silberschatz    The use of data at different levels of information
              content is  essential to the performance of very large databases because lower 
              information content (or lower resolution) data is smaller and thus  can
              significantly decrease I/O and communication costs.  The  ability to trade
              query response resolution for faster performance  has been suggested as an
              approach to meeting real-time performance  constraints.  These two performance
              advantages of a multiresolution  system can be exploited fully only by a
              database management system  (DBMS) that supports the convenient retrieval of
              data at different  levels of resolution.  A data model that defines and
              supports the  notions of multiresolution and incremental improvement of query 
              responses, or "progressive refinement," is constructed.  The basis  of this
              model is a new construct, called the "sandbag," for  representing imprecise
              information about a set.  Practical,  efficient algorithms that implement the
              sandbag, and thus enable a  multiresolution DBMS, are developed.  An extended
              query language  that specifies the tradeoff of resolution for performance, and
              a  mechanism for implementing such queries, are also developed.  This  research
              will provide solutions which effectively balance  performance and cost for the
              information-processing challenges of  next generation database applications
              such as multimedia,  scientific, geographic, and other very large databases.
