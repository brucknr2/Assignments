Abstract    :
              9312590  Solbrig  This project will study the effects of fire on vegetation
              biodiversity and heterogeneity in the cerrado, a savanna region in
              south-central Brazil. The aim of ecology is not just to describe pattern in
              nature, but to explain the mechanisms that contribute to that pattern. To
              assess the effects of fire on biodiversity and heterogeneity, this study will
              incorporate analyses of population and community ecology. Community level data
              will be collected in transects sampled across replicated experimental plots
              which are either burned frequently or left unburned. Population level data will
              focus on the effects of fire on the reproduction, growth and survivorship of
              nine common species, three species of grass and six tree species.  %%%  The
              cerrado region of Brazil has an unusually high diversity of plant species
              compared to other savanna regions. Fire has been an important force in the
              development of cerrado vegetation, but the precise effects of fire on species
              diversity in the cerrado is unknown. Although fire is commonly used as a
              management tool by ranchers, the long-term effects of this practice are
              relevant to species conservation. In addition, the importance of fire as a
              management tool in ecological reserves and national parks is still poorly
              understood. This study will provide experimental data on the effects of fire on
              community diversity and species survival in this species-rich region of Brazil.
