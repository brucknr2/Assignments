Abstract    :
              Economical design of beams and girders normally requires thin webs.            
              With the advancement in welding technology, pre-manufactured beams             
              with built-up sections are gradually replacing beams made of rolled            
              shapes in Europe and Japan.  The objective of the proposal is to               
              study the behavior, to failure, of beams and girders with                      
              corrugated webs.  The investigation will include identification of             
              the most efficient shape of corrugation, and the associated methods            
              of forming and welding.  The approach will consist of experimental             
              and analytical investigations of the behavior of beams and girders             
              with corrugated webs under in-plane shear, in-plane bending, and               
              combinations thereof.  The results will include semi-empirical                 
              methods to predict the ultimate capacity of beams and girders with             
              corrugated webs and a guide to design criteria.
