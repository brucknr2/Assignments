Abstract    :
                   The investigators continue work to develop numerical methods  for solving
              problems of flows in porous media and to develop and  analyze fast algorithms
              for partial differential equations, for  computational fluid dynamics, and for
              several linear algebra  problems.  Specifically, they (a) develop fast parallel
              numerical  methods for the solution of the Boltzmann equation used to model 
              the transport of neutral and charged particles in 1 and 3 spatial  dimensions;
              (b) develop multilevel zonal techniques for large  scale computational fluid
              dynamics applications on parallel  computers; (c) study discretization and
              solution techniques for  fluid flows in porous media that involve complex
              geometry with  heterogeneous material properties; (d) develop a new methodology
               for the solution of systems of partial differential equations by  introducing
              new dependent variables and forming a least-squares  functional.  In each case,
              they exploit and extend multi-level  computational techniques.         These
              projects are focused on important applications, such as  calculating radiation
              doses for cancer treatment, ion implantation  for semiconductor development,
              global weather modeling, fluid flow  over airfoils and through rocket nozzles,
              oil recovery and  contaminant transport in subsurface water supplies.  They
              reflect  the growing recognition that effective numerical modeling of  physical
              phenomena involves several stages - formulation of the  mathematical model,
              transforming the model into a discrete  problem, and developing algorithms for
              the numerical solution of  the discrete problem on advanced computers - none of
              which should  be attempted without consideration for the others.  Each project 
              examines all components of the process, reformulating the model  and
              discretization when necessary to yield discrete problems that  can be
              efficiently  solved numerically on parallel computers.
