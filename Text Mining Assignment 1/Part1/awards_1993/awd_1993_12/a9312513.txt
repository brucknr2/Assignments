Abstract    :
              9312513  Poling    The successful description of phase equilibria in
              aqueous-weak  electrolyte systems requires an accurate description of the 
              liquid phase composition.  In models that are now used,  concentrations of all
              the ionic species in such a liquid phase  are calculated, but these calculated
              compositions are not based  on experimental determinations of true ionic
              compositions.  To  reliably evaluate existing models, and develop improved
              models,  experimental determinations of the liquid phase compositions  will be
              essential.    The goal of the proposed research is to determine the 
              concentrations of the ionic species in a typical aqueous-weak  electrolyte
              system.  Specifically, it is proposed to use carbon-  13 NMR to determine the
              concentrations of the carbonate,  bicarbonate, and carbamate ions in
              equilibrium in the liquid  phase for the CO2 -NH3-H20 systems.  The behavior of
              the  carbonate-bicarbonate equilibrium is well established.  But in  spite of
              the industrial and biological importance of the C02-  NH3-H20 system, the
              equilibrium behavior of reactions involving  the carbamate has not been
              established experimentally.  It is  proposed to establish this behavior over a
              range of  concentrations and temperatures.  ***
