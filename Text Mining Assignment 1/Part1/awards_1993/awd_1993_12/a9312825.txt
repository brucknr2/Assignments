Abstract    :
              9312825  Dick  This is an award to provide support for research, the objective 
              of which is to determine the source and fate of fine particles  emerging from
              wastewater and associated treatment processes as an  initial step toward
              improved process design and operation to  exercise control over these
              discharges.  The investigator plans  to develop procedures for tagging
              particles that enter the  process and tracing their path through the various
              unit  operations that comprise a wastewater treatment system.  Techniques for
              tracking the particles that will be investigated  include neutron activation,
              fluorescent marking, radiolabeling,  elemental and chemical analyses, particle
              size measurement and  microscopic examination.    Results of this project are
              expected to provide a better  understanding than now exists for the fate of
              fine particles that  are present in wastewater and those produced during the
              treatment  processes.  This improved understanding in turn is expected to 
              provide the basis for improvement of engineering design and  operation of
              processes and systems for wastewater treatment and  for managing the residual
              sludges derived from these treatment  processes.
