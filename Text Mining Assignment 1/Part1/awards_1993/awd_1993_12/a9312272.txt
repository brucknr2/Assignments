Abstract    :
              9312272  Ogden       This proposal seeks support for an international group 30- 
              35 scientists to attend a workshop in Moorea, French Polynesia,  6-11 September
              1993, which will address the topic of ecosystem  function and biological
              diversity (biodiversity) as it relates to  coral reefs.  This is one of a
              series of workshops which SCOPE  (UNESCO's Scientific Committee on the
              Protection of the  Environment) has proposed for this topic in relation to 12
              biotic  regions:  tundra, ocean upwelling systems, estuaries,  Mediterranean,
              islands, boreal forest, coral reefs, savanna,  tropical forests, freshwater
              systems, temperate forests, and arid  zones.  Following the workshops, there
              will be an overall  synthesis meeting in Asilomar, California, in 1944, leading
              to an  unprecedented knowledge base and a substantial publication in  support
              of future strategies for research and conservation of  biodiversity.  %%% 
              Specific questions to be addressed in the workshop include:  Do  losses of
              biodiversity compromise the capacity of coral reefs to  maintain their
              functional and structural integrity?  What are the  implications of
              biodiversity for the sustainable use of reef  resources, both for reef-based
              recreation, eco-tourism and other  commercial activity, and for subsistence
              farming and harvesting  (particularly in poor and developing countries)?  Over
              what  spatial and temporal scales are alterations in biodiversity on  coral
              reefs manifest as alterations in biogeochemical processes,  and do they
              contribute significantly to changes in ocean-  atmosphere fluxes?  ***
