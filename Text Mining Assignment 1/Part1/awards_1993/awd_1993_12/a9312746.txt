Abstract    :
              ***  9312746  Guo  This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will
              develop a technique of non-destructive testing and evaluation (NDT&E) by
              three-dimensional quantitative imaging of dielectric permittivity.  The
              dielectric image of a target is reconstructed by measuring the microwave
              scattering field and utilizing a scattering inversion algorithm.  It is
              expected to yield a resolution unlimited by wavelength, and only limited by
              signal-to-noise ratio.  To overcome wavelength limitation, the scattering
              equation is digitized into a matrix form without far-field approximation.  To
              stabilize the inversion and reduce its sensitivity to noises, the number of
              near-field scattering data is increased to more than the number of voxels in
              the target and a least-mean-square method is used to fit the equations.  The
              research is expected to lead to development of low-cost and transportable
              quantitative NDT&E equipment.  Owing to the sensitivity of dielectric
              permittivity to various materials, it will provide sharper contrast than
              existing devices.  The imaging processing time is expected to be in
              milliseconds, the exposure time in the order of microseconds, with microwave
              dose in the order of microwatt per gram to tens of microwatt per gram, which is
              two to three orders of magnitude below the safety level of continuous exposure.
                 The project is expected to lead to development of a real-time
              three-dimensional imaging apparatus for dielectric permittivities in the
              microwave regime.  Commercial applications include all non-destructive
              evaluation of non-metallic bodies, such as airport luggage interrogation,
              measurement of moisture contents in concrete and roofing materials, and
              monitoring of material defects.    ***
