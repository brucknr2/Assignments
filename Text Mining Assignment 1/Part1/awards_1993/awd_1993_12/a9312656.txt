Abstract    :
              INT 9312656  Fendler    This US-Hungary workshop on "Environmental Chemistry,"
              organized by Dr. Janos Fendler  of Syracuse University and Dr. Imre Dekany of
              Attila Jozsef University, Hungary, will be  held in Hungary during September
              5-8, 1993.  The workshop will bring together ten  Hungarian scientists and
              engineers with ten from the United States to define an agenda for  future,
              long-term cooperative research that will address environmental problems. 
              Efforts of  the participants will directed toward those pollution problems
              which may be defined as  chemical reactions, governed by fundamental molecular
              interactions.  The goal of this  workshop is to stimulate new cooperative
              research that bears upon the fundamental issues  affecting environmental
              problems.  The research agenda to be formulated during the meeting  will draw
              upon multiple disciplines in chemistry and examine problems from the
              theoretical,  computational and experimental perspectives.    While the
              workshop will be organized by the United States and Hungary, other participants
               from France, the Czech Republic, the Slovak Republic, Bulgaria, Romania, and
              Poland will  participate.  The intent is to involve chemists throughout the
              region in early stages of  planning cooperative research with the hope of
              strengthening professional ties that cross  national boundaries.  Results of
              the workshop should include new competitive, proposals for  joint research in
              environmental chemistry and an invigorated, better coordinated multi-  national
              approach to examining chemical solutions to basic environmental problems.
