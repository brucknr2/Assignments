Abstract    :
               Most testing methods generate test descriptions which define the  desired
              characteristics of the input data in a test case.  A  method of test 
              refinement is pursued in which a knowledge base  is used to accumulate 
              experience about object semantics and  object class/subclass relationships in a
               particular problem  domain.  Special attention is paid to those objects and 
              relationships that experience has shown to be error-prone.  Employing this 
              knowledge to refine test cases arising from other  methods increases the focus 
              of those test cases upon error-prone  aspects of the problem domain.  By this 
              means, the project improves the detection of subtle faults that would  have
              escaped  more conventional testing methods.    The combination of  refinement
              with specification-based  equivalence partitioning yields a testing  method
              called Knowledge-Driven Functional Testing (KDFT).  This method is  believed to
              be  particularly interesting because the concomitant analysis of the 
              specification may lead to early detection of specification and  design errors. 
              This project is investigating KDFT and the process of test-case  refinement. 
              In  its first phase, refinement is employed in  an experimental study for 
              testing a module of avionics software.  The second phase consists of a similar 
              study applied to series of  related software projects drawn from a common 
              application domain.
