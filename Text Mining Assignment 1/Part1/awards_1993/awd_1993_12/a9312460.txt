Abstract    :
              9312460  Dinnocenzo  The generality, scope, and limitations of three-electron
              SN2   substitutions on cation radical sigma bonds will be studied.   The study
              will: (1) extend the variety of nucleophiles that   can be used in practical
              substitution reactions, (2)   investigate the factors that control the
              regiochemistry of   three-electron SN2 reactions, (3) probe the electronic  
              structures of various cyclopropane cation radicals to test  
              structure/reactivity relationships, and (4) test the   viability of
              substitution reactions on simple, alkyl-  substituted cyclopropane cation
              radicals and, in addition,   cation radicals which do not contain a
              cyclopropane ring.  %%%  This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports
              the   work of Professor Joseph P. Dinnocenzo at the University of   Rochester.
              The reactions of electron-rich molecules with   cyclopropane cation radicals
              will be studied. The latter   species are three-carbon cycles in which one
              electron has   been removed. The study will include consideration of where  
              the electron-rich molecule attacks the cyclopropane cation   radical and
              extension of the reaction to species other than   the cyclopropane cation
              radical. These reactions will have   the potential to make larger molecules
              that are of interest.   The reaction to be studied will provide important  
              theoretical insight as well, since it is the three-electron   analog of a
              common two-electron substitution reaction.  ***
