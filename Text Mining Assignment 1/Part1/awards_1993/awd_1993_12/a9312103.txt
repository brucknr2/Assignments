Abstract    :
              This proposal is for partial                                                   
              support of group travel and                                                    
              publication of a conference                                                    
              proceeding.  The conference is on                                              
              the subject of precise measurements                                            
              in power systems in particular on                                              
              synchronized phasor measurements,                                              
              precise timing, and digital                                                    
              recording systems.  This relates to                                            
              a new and promising development in                                             
              the operation of power systems.  If                                            
              the technology can be worked out                                               
              and the analytical techniques to                                               
              support it can also be made

              power systems would be greatly                                                 
              enhanced.
