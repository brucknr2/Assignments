Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The proposed research represents a collaborative research project              
              entitled "Embryonic Stem Cell Equivalents in Zebrafish to Study                
              Early Development".  The three principle investigators are Nancy               
              Hopkins (Massachusetts Institute of Technology), Wilbur Long                   
              (Western Maryland College), and Paul Collodi (Purdue).  The long               
              range goal is to understand early developmental processes at the               
              genetic level in the zebrafish, Brachydanio rerio.  The immediate              
              goal is to follow up promising new results which suggest that it               
              may be possible to develop an equivalent to mouse embryonic stem               
              (ES) cells for zebrafish.  With this technology, one can mutate                
              genes by random insertion of promoter or gene trap constructs or by            
              targeted homologous recombination, select cells with desired                   
              alterations, and then generate mutant organisms from them.  The                
              zebrafish would be a superb organism in which to perform this type             
              of mutagenesis and if successful, this approach would make it                  
              possible to isolate large numbers of insertional mutants affecting             
              the desired developmental processes as well as targeted mutations              
              in genes suspected of playing important roles in the processes.
