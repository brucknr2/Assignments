Abstract    :
              This grant in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program                     
              provides partial support for the 1993 Gordon Research Conference               
              on Analytical Chemistry.  This conference, which brings together               
              analytical scientists from industry, academia, and government                  
              laboratories, has as its 1993 focus industry-academic                          
              interactions.  The funding provided will be used to support the                
              participation of ten young analytical faculty and six award

              This grant will enable the participation of ten young analytical               
              chemistry faculty and six analytical chemistry graduate students               
              in interactions with industrial and other academic scientists at               
              the 1993 Gordon Research Conference on Analytical Chemistry.
