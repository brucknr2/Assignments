Abstract    :
              9312534  Bean    This three-year continuing award is augmenting the basic
              research  program of Lehigh University's Industry/University Cooperative 
              Research Center for Innovation Management Studies.  This funding is  provided
              under the "Self-Sufficient Partnership for Research"  Program.  The Center
              continues to meet the renewal criteria  requirements of the Industry/University
              Cooperative Research  Centers Program.    Funding for an evaluator to study the
              industry/university  interaction occurring in the Center is part of the
              three-year  continuing award.    Additional funding is provided for a woman
              undergraduate to augment  the Center's research program.  She will study
              "Technology Transfer  in the Construction Industry."    A woman Professor from
              Brandeis University is being funded as a  Research Opportunity Award (ROA) to
              study "Downsizing Industrial  R&D:  Effects on the Work Environment for
              Creativity and  Innovation."    The U.S. Department of Energy's Environmental
              Restoration and Waste  Management Office is providing funds to obtain a
              non-voting  membership in the Center.    The Program Manager recommends Lehigh
              University be awarded:   $28,000 for the first year of a three-year continuing
              award  (includes $8,000 for the evaluator); $4,000 for one year for a  woman
              undergraduate student; $20,006 for one year for a ROA to  Brandeis University;
              and $10,000 for one year with funds provided  by the U.S. Department of Energy.
                 Near the end of each 12-month period, the Program Manager and/or  the
              Division Director of the Engineering Education Center Division  will review the
              progress of the Center on a number of renewal  criteria requirements, including
              the following:  1) the extent to  which the industry/university is developing;
              2) the extent to which  the support base is developing; and 3) the extent to
              which a robust  research program is developing.  If the review is satisfactory,
              the  Program Manager will recommend support for the next period of this 
              continuing award.
