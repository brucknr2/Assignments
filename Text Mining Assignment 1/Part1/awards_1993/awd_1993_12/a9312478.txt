Abstract    :
              9312478  Morgan  This U.S.-Mexico award will support a research  workshop in
              atomic and molecular physics.  Organized  by Prof. Thomas Morgan of Wesleyan
              University and  Prof. Carmen Cisneros of the Institute of Physics of 
              Cuernavaca, this workshop will involve researchers  from Canada and Europe to
              promote new  collaborations, facilitate the transfer of ideas  among
              researchers from different areas of  specialization, and strengthen ties with a
              strong  nucleus of researchers in this area in Mexico.  A  key feature of this
              workshop will be the  participation of junior researchers to promote new 
              collaborations.      The proposed topic for this workshop, few-body  problems
              and correlation, continues to be a topic of  much current interest and in the
              past two years many  new findings have emerged, both in theory and  experiment.
               A sample of the topics to be discussed  includes electron scattering, simple
              molecules,  multiply charged ion collisions, excited state  systems, and chaos
              and photon effects (both laser  and synchrotron radiation research.)    ***
