Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  James Goodwin  CTS-9312519    This is study of the effects of 
              readsorption and  diffusion in solid-state isotopic transient  kinetic analysis
              (SSITKA).  Several modelling techniques, including nondimensionalizing,
              compartmentalization, and parameter lumping, are used in modelling the
              processes.  Laplace transforms produce model transients for comparison to
              experiments.  The important parameters of readsorption and diffusion effecting
              SSITKA are determined.  Readsorption is modeled without diffusion or reaction,
              and these parameters are then added sequentially.  Intraparticle diffusion is
              treated similarly, and the two approaches combined into a total SSITKA model.  
               Solid-state isotopic transient kinetic analysis is a powerful method for the
              study of catalytic reactions and provides kinetic and mechanistic information
              that often is otherwise unobtainable.  This effort will add a major element of
              finesse to the technique and should make SSITKA data more useful for process
              and reactor design.
