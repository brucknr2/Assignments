Abstract    :
              9312748  Whitley       A grammar tree encodes a cellular developmental process
              that  can develop whole families of Boolean neural networks.  The  development
              process resembles biological cell division.  A single  cell executes a program
              specified by a grammar tree and undergoes  cell division to develop a complete
              neural network capable of  computing specific target functions.  A genetic
              algorithm is used  to find a grammar tree that yields both architecture and
              weights  specifying a particular neural network for solving specific Boolean 
              functions, such as parity and symmetry problems.  Because cellular  encodings
              include recursive descriptions, the resulting "genetic  code" is much smaller
              than the neural networks that are developed  from these codes.  Preliminary
              research has also shown the  effectiveness of very simple Hebbian learning for
              speeding up the  evolution of grammar trees.  The proposed research will
              continue to  develop grammar trees that specify neural networks for a wider 
              variety of applications as well as to develop more sophisticated  learning
              models to use in combination with cellular development.   The specification of
              nonBoolean networks must be investigated so as  generalized the types of
              networks that can be generated by cellular  development.  Genetic algorithms
              are being used to evolve the  grammar tree for the cellular development
              process; as a result,  learning algorithms that have minimal computational
              requirements  will be investigated
