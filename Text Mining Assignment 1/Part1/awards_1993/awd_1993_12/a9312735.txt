Abstract    :
              9312735  Yeh  The purpose of this United States-Brazil joint project is to 
              study the Caraibas irrigation project which is under construction  and located
              within the "drought polygon" of the Northeastern  region of Brazil.  An
              automated gate control system that can  function in an open or close loop mode,
              and sensors for signaling  demand changes and fluctuations in water levels and
              gateflows are  being installed.  Data  from this systems will be used to 
              validate and develop automatic control methods as well as various  modes of
              operation compatible with on-demand irrigation water  delivery and aqueduct
              systems designed for arid and semi-arid  regions.  ***
