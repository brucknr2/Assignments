Abstract    :
              9312856  Thompson         This award is made in the Advanced Materials and
              Processing   Program in support of the research of Professor Thompson at  
              Princeton University.  Support is provided by the Chemistry   Division. The
              research will focus on the mechanism of formation   of photoinduced
              charge-separated states in zirconium   phosphonate sheets separated by viologen
              halides. These   microcrystalline solids will be grown as thin sheets and  
              labeling and substitution studies employed to elucidate both   reversible and
              irreversible mechanisms of charge separation.   Investigations into how the
              structures and electrochemical   properties of the films relate to their
              photochemistry will be   carried out. These electroactive films supported on a
              metal   electrode can be made to contain all of the elements necessary   for
              harvesting light, electron and proton transfer, and   catalysis. They will be
              screened for activity towards carbon   dioxide reduction and water-splitting. 
              %%%  Layered zirconium viologen phosphonates are new materials which   show
              promise in a variety of practical  applications including   energy storage,
              electron transfer relays and catalysts for the   photoreduction of carbon
              dioxide and protons.  ***
