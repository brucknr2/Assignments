Abstract    :
              This research will examine new methods of using light to manipulate matter, 
              from individual atoms, to small but macroscopic objects.  The research has 
              three main objectives:  (1) To enhance the basic understanding of the processes
               that govern the manipulation of matter by light.  (2) To apply understanding 
              toward the creation of permanent structures which are scientifically and 
              technologically useful.  (3) To accelerate understanding by providing for a 
              close collaboration between diverse groups, and enhance the human  resource 
              base. ***
