Abstract    :
              The importance of seabirds as part of the marine ecosystem has                 
              only recently been recognized. In order to understand the                      
              dynamics of polar marine ecosystems, a focus on the interaction                
              between the physical environment and the major biological                      
              components, including such apex predators as marine mammals and                
              seabirds, is required. This workshop will focus on Southern Ocean              
              seabird species, but will include arctic and temperate species.                
              The development of new instrumentation and sampling techniques                 
              for studying seabirds during the last decade has given valuable                
              insights into their physiology, population biology and community               
              ecology. As new approaches have developed, concern has been                    
              raised about the introduction of bias into the data being                      
              obtained. This workshop will address the topic of research                     
              protocols used in seabird studies with the aim of understanding                
              the effects on the population studied and the data collected.
