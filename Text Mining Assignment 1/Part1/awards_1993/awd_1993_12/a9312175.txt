Abstract    :
              9312175  Shafi  Description:  This project provides $20,000 to  support the  
              participation of up to ten leading U.S.  scientists at a regional Summer
              School/Workshop  in Physics, Kathmandu, Nepal, May 22-June 7,  1994.  The theme
              is "Selected Topics in Field  Theory, High Energy Physics and Cosmology."   Its
              aim is to: 1) bring together some of the  brightest young physicists from the
              BCSPIN  countries of South Asia, 2) present the most  recent advances in their
              fields of research and  3) emphasize the rich and exciting frontiers  that
              straddle Field Theory, High Energy Physics  and Cosmology.  The topics covered
              include:  Introduction to Advanced Topics in Field  Theory, Anomaly and
              Topology in Field Theory,  Tests of the Standard Model Particle Physics, 
              Supersymmetry, Frontiers in  Cosmology/Astrophysics, including Structure 
              Formation, Black Hole Physics and Related  Areas.       Scope:  The
              establishment of a school of  excellence will contribute to the growth of 
              science in Asia and will greatly strengthen the  scientific potential of young
              researchers  there.    Without the opportunity given by a  school of this kind,
              it is unlikely that the  majority of the students would ever have  exposure to
              such outstanding scientists.   Previous schools have been highly regarded and 
              the best students will no doubt eventually  enrich American science.      ***
