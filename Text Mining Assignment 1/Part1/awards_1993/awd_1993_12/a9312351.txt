Abstract    :
              9312351  Lin    Dr. Lin will utilize the recently determined proper motion of
              the  Large Magellanic Cloud and the radial velocities along the  Magellanic
              Stream to investigate the history of the dynamical  interaction between our
              Galaxy and the Magellanic Clouds.  The mass  distribution in the halo of our
              Galaxy can be determined, as well  as the present proper motion of the
              Magellanic Stream.
