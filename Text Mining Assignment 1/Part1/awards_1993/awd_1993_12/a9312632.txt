Abstract    :
              9312632  Mickelson  This proposal is for sponsorship of a small  workshop to be
              held with approximately 50-75  participants from industry, university, and 
              government laboratories and agencies.  All  participants will be involved in 
              optoelectronic packaging.  The purpose will  be to try to identify major
              problems in an  area loosely termed optoelectronic packaging  through
              discussion of the research challenges  faced in advanced optoelectronic
              packaging as  well as methods of fostering an atmosphere in  which there will
              be free exchange between  university and industrial researchers.   Graduate
              students will be encouraged to  attend the workshop by travel supports.  Such 
              non-classroom education will enhance  students' experiences through group 
              discussions and poster exchanges.  ***
