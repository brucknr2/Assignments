Abstract    :
              9312285  Mattice    Technical Narrative:    This project represents a
              collaborative research  effort between the University of Akron and  Bogazici
              University, Istanbul, Turkey.  The  investigators intend to develop procedures
              for  the simulation of polymers in three environments  -- inclusion complexes,
              the amorphous polymer at  bulk density, and diblock copolymer micelles.   This
              research may prove valuable in gaining  insight into the factors that influence
              the  dynamics of flexible chains and their rate of  entry exchange into and out
              of micelles.  The  problems to be addressed in this research are  relevant to a
              wide range of practical problems in  polymer processing and polymer
              structure-property  relations.   Project funding will enable the  researchers
              to develop simulations on both  campuses and to visit each other's laboratory 
              over the course of this three-year study.    This project in materials research
              fulfills the  program objective of advancing scientific  knowledge by enabling
              leading experts in the  United States and Turkey to combine complementary 
              talents and conduct research in areas of strong  mutual interest and
              competence.  ***
