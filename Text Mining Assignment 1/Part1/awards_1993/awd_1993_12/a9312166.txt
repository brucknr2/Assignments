Abstract    :
              9312166  OConnor  This support will enable the improvement and rehousing of the
              arthropod collections in the Museum of Zoology, U. Michigan, in the form of new
              cabinets (174) and drawers (5200) to replace substandard ones and to
              accommodate growth.   The collection, with 4 million specimens and 1012
              holotypes, is the third largest university insect collection in North America
              and is particularly strong in Odonata, Orthoptera, Diptera, Coleoptera and
              Acari.  This improvement will occur in concert with the university's renovation
              of the collection areas: specifically, the institution will construct a new wet
              lab and counters, and prepare the space for air conditioning,  with an
              estimated expenditure of $520,000 for the divisions of Insects and Amphibians &
              Reptiles in the Museum of Zoology.  The collection is indispensable for
              biodiversity research and education regionally, nationally and internationally.
               This improvement will allow better access to the material for researchers and
              students and will help preserve these holdings for future generations of
              biologists.  %%%  The Museum of Zoology, U. Michigan houses one of the most
              important arthropod collections in the country: with 4 million specimens, it is
              the third largest university insect collection in North America.  This support
              will allow rehousing of the material threatened by substandard and deteriorated
              drawers and cabinets.  At the same time, the institution is providing $520,000
              worth of capital improvements to the collection facilities, including
              climate-control and new laboratories.  This support will provide much easier
              and safer access to the specimens fo r researchers and students in
              biodiversity, and will protect the collection for future biologists.  ***
