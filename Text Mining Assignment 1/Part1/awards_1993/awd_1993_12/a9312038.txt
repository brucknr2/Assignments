Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  In an effort to gain the community's interest in and awareness            
              of the need to increase the participation of women in CISE                     
              disciplines, the Computing Research Association (CRA) is being                 
              funded to present a one day and one evening symposium for 200                  
              undergraduate and graduate female students. The National Science               
              Foundation's CISE Directorate has established a goal that 45% of               
              graduate students in CISE disciplines will be women by the year                
              2000. The symposium, which is one of a number of activities being              
              recommended by CISE, is to be held on May 22nd. and 23rd., 1993 in             
              Washington, D.C. The students will be studying in CISE areas and               
              will be nominated by their institutions.                                       
                                                                                             
                   The CRA is an association of U.S. and Canadian academic                   
              departments of Computer Science and Computer Engineering, and                  
              Industrial Laboratories engaging in basic computing research. The              
              mission of CRA is to represent and inform the computing research               
              community and to support and promote its interests. Dr. Weingarten             
              is the Executive Director of CRA.
