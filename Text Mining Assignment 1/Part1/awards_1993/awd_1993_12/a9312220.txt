Abstract    :
              9312220  VANCAPPELLIN    The major mechanism removing silicon from the oceans is
              the burial  in sediments of biogenic silica remains.  The burial flux of 
              biogenic silica is controlled by production in surface waters, and  by
              dissolution in the water column and surface sediments.  To gain  a better
              understanding of the dissolution process of biogenic  silica, flow-through
              experiments will be performed with freshly  collected sediment material and
              natural seawater.  The experiments  will address the role of pH, temperature,
              Na, Mg and Al on the  dissolution process.  The proposed research will also
              establish the  evolution of the reactivity of biogenic silica as a function of 
              depth/time in the sediments.  The study will include dissolution  experiments
              with the superficial fluff layer material, in order to  quantify the amount of
              deposited biogenic silica that is recycled  at the water-sediment interface. 
              The experimentally determined  kinetic rate laws, rate constants and
              solubilities will be included  in an early diagenetic model for silica.  The
              model will be used to  test the response of (1) the flux of silicic acid from
              the  sediments to the overlying water and (2) the burial flux of  particulate
              silica, to variations of the silica deposition flux.
