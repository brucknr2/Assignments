Abstract    :
              9312952  Rodriguez  In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the 
              Chemistry Division Prof. Art Rodriguez of East Carolina  University will carry
              out a series of NMR measurements of the  carbon-13 spin-relaxation time of
              buckminsterfullerene in a  number of organic solvents having different
              molecular  properties.  The measurements will be made as function of 
              temperature and magnetic field strength for each of the  solvents.  %%% 
              Research on the properties of fullerenes is at the forefront of  chemistry. 
              Most of the attention has been given so far to the  synthesis and properties of
              individual fullerene molecules and  the data base for fullerene properties in
              solution is very  sparse.  The special fullerene to be studied is 
              buckminsterfullerene, a nearly spherical compound composed of  60 carbon atoms.
               The experimental data obtained will be used  to test a simplified model for
              molecular reorientation in  liquid solutions.  ***
