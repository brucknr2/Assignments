Abstract    :
              9312774  Margulies       This award is for research in elementary particle
              physics by  a group which includes three faculty members, a postdoctoral 
              research associate and two graduate students.  They will continue  their
              involvement on QCD processes that result in muon pairs in  the fixed-target
              experiment E672 at the Fermilab Tevatron.  The  group's analysis efforts are
              concentrated on events with psi-  particles, some fraction of which are B-meson
              decay products.   With these they expect to obtain results on B production and 
              exclusive decay rates.  They will also continue to search for  charm hyperon
              decays among the selected events.  Another activity  is their R&D on
              scintillating-fiber tracking.  That is done with  the near-term aim to provide
              a tracker for the upgraded D0  detector at the Tevatron and the ultimate goal
              of including a  fiber tracker in the detector SDC at the Superconducting Super 
              Collider.  ***
