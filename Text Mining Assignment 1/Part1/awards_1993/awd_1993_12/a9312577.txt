Abstract    :
              9312577  Segall       This award provides 52 per cent of the cost of acquiring
              four  new Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers and of upgrading four 
              older generation receivers so that they will be capable of  positioning with an
              accuracy in the millimeter range. The receivers  are to be used for accurate
              geodetic measurements in research  projects of the crustal dynamics group in
              the Department of  Geophysics at Stanford University. The University is
              committed to  providing the remaining funds needed for the acquisition and 
              upgrade.       The Global Positioning System, when utilized with state-of- 
              the-art receivers and data processing methods, is capable of  measuring
              horizontal and vertical motions of the continental crust  with sub-centimeter
              precision. GPS will be used by the Stanford  group to measure plate tectonic
              motion, strain build-up near active  faults, displacement due to earthquakes,
              deformation associated  with volcanic activity, and subsidence due to
              underground fluid  extraction.  ***
