Abstract    :
              9312257  Bruxvoort       This project connects William Penn College to NSFNET
              through  the MIDNET mid-level network over a 56 kbps line.  Faculty and 
              students will benefit from access to the resources of the Internet,  including
              libraries and supercomputers.  In addition, they will be  able to communicate
              and collaborate with colleagues at other  institutions in pursuit of research
              and educational projects.  The  award provides partial support of the project
              for two years.  ***
