Abstract    :
              9312087       This project involves interdisciplinary research taking  place in
              a laboratory setting, in which mathematical theory and  applied scientific
              problems are attacked in an environment  supporting modern computational
              methods and advanced computer  graphics.  Some of the problems considered are:
              grain boundaries  of compound materials; global behavior of embedded minimal 
              surfaces and computational methods for finding Willmore extrema;  computation
              of conformal knot energies and stable "multiple  bubble" configurations; fluid
              flow problems. In addition software  tools, automated video techniques and
              networking tools will be  developed, tailored to the interdisciplinary research
              being  carried out.
