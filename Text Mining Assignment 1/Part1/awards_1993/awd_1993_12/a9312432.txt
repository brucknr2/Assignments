Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This is a proposal submitted under Small Grants for                       
              Exploratory Research (SGER), employing laboratory methods to                   
              explore the feasibility of experimentally testing theoretical                  
              propositions developed through computer simulations.  It will                  
              investigate the behavior of human subjects in a social dilemma in              
              which they must choose between contributing to or withdrawing                  
              from a common fund, testing hypotheses concerning the classic                  
              problems of the free rider and the evolution of cooperation.                   
              Three hypotheses are to be tested: (1) Serial consistency in                   
              observed contribution will be smaller when the associated                      
              outcomes are negative and larger when they are positive.  (2) The              
              observed contribution rate increases with the rate of                          
              contribution by the simulated group.  (3) The second hypothesis                
              holds only in a public-goods condition and not in a private-goods              
              condition.                                                                     
                                                                                             
                   This is preliminary work that develops novel ideas, applies               
              a new approach, and opens a new research area.  Whatever the                   
              outcome of the three hypotheses, it will make a significant                    
              contribution in two ways.  First, it will link the two                         
              methodologies of computer simulation and laboratory                            
              experimentation with human subjects, which can then be adopted by              
              other researchers.  Second, it will demonstrate that a promising               
              set of new theoretical developments can be assessed empirically,               
              thus opening the door to a number of valuable studies by other                 
              investigators.
