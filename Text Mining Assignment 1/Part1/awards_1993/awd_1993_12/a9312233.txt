Abstract    :
                9312233  Gordon    This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation
              Program   will assist the Department of Chemistry at Harvard  University   in
              the purchase of an upgrade for a 500 MHz, multinuclear,   nuclear magnetic
              resonance (NMR) spectrometer. This upgrade will   enhance greatly research in a
              number of  areas including the   following:    1)  Total synthesis of
              interesting and challenging molecules   such as: (a) miroestrol, a structurally
              novel ingredient of an   oriental medicinal herb with interesting biological
              properties,   (b) paeoniflorin, a complex polycyclic plant glucoside and (c)  
              inhibitors of tumor angiogenesis such as ovalicin,    2)  Natural product
              synthesis of palytoxin,    3)  Conformational studies of C- and O-glycosides,  
               4)  Polyether macrolide halichondrins,    5)  Structural and functional
              studies of signaling proteins,    6)  Structural and mechanistic studies of
              nucleic acids and   nucleic-acid binding proteins,    %%%       A nuclear
              magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer is used to   obtain information about
              molecular structure (what types of   carbon and/or hydrogen atoms and/or
              hetero-atoms are present,   what are the relative number of each type of atoms
              and how are   they connected to one another in the molecule) and molecular  
              dynamics (how rapidly are the various parts of the molecule   moving).  This
              instrument is essential for any meaningful,   modern synthetic chemistry
              research program.  ***
