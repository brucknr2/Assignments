Abstract    :
              9312549  Abbott    This three-year continuing award is under the
              "Self-Sufficient  Partnership for Research" Program. It supports basic research
              to  augment the research agenda of North Carolina State University's 
              Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Communications  and Signal
              Processing.  The Center continues to meet the renewal  criteria requirements of
              the I/UCRC Program.    Funding for a three-year continuing award for an
              evaluator to study  the industry/university interaction occurring in the Center
              is also  provided.    The U.S. Army (AMSEL) is providing funding to augment
              ongoing  research projects and to obtain a membership in the Center.   
              Additional funding is provided by the U.S. Department of Energy's 
              Environmental Restoration and Waste Management Office to obtain a  non-voting
              membership in the Center.    The Program Manager recommends North Carolina
              State University be:  awarded $58,000 for the first year of a three-year
              continuing award  (includes $8,000 for an evaluator); $50,000 for one year with
              funds  provided by the U.S. Army (AMSEL); and $10,000 for one year with  funds
              provided by the U.S. Department of Energy.    Near the end of each 12-month
              period, the Program Manager and/or  the Division Director of the Engineering
              Education Centers Division  will review the progress of the Center on a number
              of renewal  criteria requirements, including the following:  1) the extent to 
              which university/industry interaction is developing; 2) the extent  to which
              the support base is developing; and 3) the extent to which  a robust research
              program is developing.  If the review is  satisfactory, the Program Manager
              will recommend support for the  next period of this continuing award.
