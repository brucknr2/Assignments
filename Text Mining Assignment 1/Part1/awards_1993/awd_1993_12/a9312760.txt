              Inverse Models and Orthogonal Decompositions in  Geophysical Flow    The
              purpose of this project is to simultaneously apply proper  orthogonal
              decomposition and linear inverse methods to produce  simple, easy-to-run, fast
              models which reproduce the statistics of  more complicated models.  First, a
              linear inverse model based on  the empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) of a
              series of runs of  the Shallow Water Equations (SWE) will be developed.  The
              SWE were  chosen for ease of comparison with previous and ongoing studies.  
              This simple inverse model will include the EOFs, their tendencies,  and
              statistical noise.    EOFs will then be used to construct an inverse model of
              the  Community Climate Model of NCAR.  Such an inverse model has not yet  been
              applied to climate models to our knowledge.  Thus a simple  (fast, easy-to-run)
              climate model with statistics identical to the  full climate model on which it
              was based will be constructed.  Such  a model will be useful for instances
              where the statistics need be  to reproduced, but for which the exact time
              development is not  essential.  Various sensitivity analyses will be performed
              to  determine the best methods to construct these models.    This line of
              research will lead to a new method to decrease the  number of degrees of
              freedom necessary to obtain adequate  resolution in some geophysical models. 
              In addition, it will give  new insight into the interactions of the empirical
              modes of motion.    This work is preliminary to developing s fully nonlinear
              climate  model based on orthogonal projections.    It is important because it
              would facilitate the testing of climate  hypotheses which require credible but
              simple (computationally  cheap) climate models.    This research is funded
              under the NSF USGCRP CMAP program.
