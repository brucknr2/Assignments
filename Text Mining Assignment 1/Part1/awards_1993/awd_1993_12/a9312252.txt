Abstract    :
              9312252  Muller  This proposal concerns the theoretical investigation of the 
              dynamics of quantum spin systems. It is broken into three related  areas: 1)
              Dynamics of 1D and 2D quantum antiferromagnets. The  numerical technique of
              analysis will be the recursion method which  makes it possible to extract
              information on the gaps in the  excitation spectrum, ordering in the ground
              state, infrared  singularities in spectral densities etc. 2) Transport of spin 
              fluctuations at high temperature. Spin diffusion will be studied in  classical
              and quantum systems using a mix of direct simulation and  recursion methods. At
              stake is the controversy over the long-time  behavior of spin relaxation time.
              3) Quantum chaos in spin  dynamics. The spin-boson model will be employed for a
              study of  incipient quantum chaos by looking at the quantum invariants of  time
              averages of non-conserved observables. This allows for direct  comparisons with
              manifestations of Hamiltonian chaos in  corresponding classical model systems. 
              %%%  The work here involves study of spin (magnetic) systems using a  variety
              of numerical techniques - the principal of which is the so-  called recursion
              method. This method has a rich history in  condensed matter thoery but has been
              applied only recently to spin  dynamics. The spin to which we refer is that of
              electrons in a  lattice; usually "tied" reasonably tightly to lattice sites. Of
               particular interest are the dynamics of spin diffusion and of spin  relaxation
              in model magnetic systems. Lastly, the PI proposes to  study the onset of
              quantum chaos (ie non-integrability) in spin  systems. A methodology is
              proposed to allow comparison between  quantum systems and their classical
              counterparts.  ***
