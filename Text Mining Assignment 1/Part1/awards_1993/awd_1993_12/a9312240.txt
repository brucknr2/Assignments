Abstract    :
              9312240  Goodnick  This is a renewal project to continue the development of
              parallelized algorithms for semiconductor device simulation using particle
              methods. Improvements will be made to the prototype multiprocessor code PMC-3D
              to include state of the art physics such as full band structure effects, and
              generalize the code for a variety of different device technologies and
              arbitrary geometries.  The codes will be developed in a high level parallel
              language (Dataparallel C) to increase their portability from machine to
              machine.  Furthermore, full electromagnetic solutions rather than Poission's
              equation will be coupled in the particle-force calculation, in order to develop
              simulation tools for high frequency microwave and optoelectronic device
              applications.  Parallel particle transport algorithms for semiconductor devices
              to include molecular dynamics and cellular automata techniques will developed.
              In the molecular dynamics case, hybrid particle-particle particle-mesh methods
              will be investigated to find efficient parallel algorithms which would greatly
              reduce the computational requirements of this technique.  Parallel cellular
              automata device simulation algorithms in three dimensions will be developed and
              compared with Monte Carlo methods as a cost effective alternative to the latter
              technique.  ***
