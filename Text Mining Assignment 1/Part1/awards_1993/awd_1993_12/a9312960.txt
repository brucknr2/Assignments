Abstract    :
              This reimbursable agreement provides for the conduct of a                      
              statistical survey of the scientific and technical resources                   
              utilized by U.S. companies in the performance of research                      
              and development (R&D) activities.  This survey will produce                    
              measures of the dollar volume of R&D performed domestically                    
              and abroad, sources of finance, employment of R&D scientists                   
              and engineers, and other characteristics of R&D and science                    
              and technology (S&T) in industry.                                              
                                                                                             
              Under authority granted by the National Science Foundation                     
              Act of 1950, NSF collects and disseminates descriptive                         
              economic statistics, as well as other pertinent information,                   
              about scientific and technological resource utilization and                    
              activities. Data collected by the Survey of Industrial                         
              Research and Development, when used in combination with data                   
              obtained through other NSF statistical and analytical                          
              activities, provides policy makers with an overview of R&D                     
              funding and performance in the United States.
