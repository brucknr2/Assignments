Abstract    :
              9312638  Williams       This proposal requests funds to create a statewide data 
              network linking Kentucky's public four year institutions to  SURAnet which is
              the NSF midlevel network that serves the  southeastern United States.  This new
              statewide network  connecting Eastern Kentucky University, Kentucky State 
              University, Morehead State University, Murray State University,  Northern
              Kentucky University, Princeton Research, University of  Louisville, and Western
              Kentucky University to SURAnet through  the University of Kentucky is designed
              to provided access to  111,737 students and 5,625 faculty.  The Kentucky
              Educational  Network (KECnet), a formal consortium, will provide the 
              governance structure to insure that all institutions are fairly  represented
              and the necessary steps are taken to meet all of the  connectivity needs of
              Kentucky's higher education community.       SURAnet will provide operations
              management and information  services and it will give the universities and
              colleges a  connection to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per 
              second) National Backbone network.       Each of the universities has provided
              a description of its  organization and a statement of the benefits of Internet
              access  that it expects including: greater functionality and network  speed to
              be able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make  file transfers along
              with being able to implement a more reliable  mail system.  Both students and
              faculty research will benefit  from the network which is a unique opportunity
              for the schools to  explore innovative and educational resources.    ***
