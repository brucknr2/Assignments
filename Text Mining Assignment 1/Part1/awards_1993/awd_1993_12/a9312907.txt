Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This three-year award supports U.S.-Italy cooperative                          
              research on solar diameter changes and involves Sabatino                       
              Sofia of Yale University and Professors A. Egidi                               
              and B. Caccin in the Department of Physics at the                              
              University of Rome II.  The investigators will be                              
              studying the effects of active regions on solar                                
              irradiance in order to interpret the results of the                            
              Solar Disk Sextant experiment in terms of parameters                           
              related to climate change.                                                     
                                                                                             
              The Italian group is an active one in solar research.                          
              It has collaborated in estimating the effects of                               
              various instrumental distortions, using a solar                                
              telescope to carry out observations of the sizes and                           
              locations of sunspots and faculae, and their                                   
              respective intensities.  They have developed a                                 
              parallel and independent method for data reduction and                         
              analysis.  The joint project results will be used to                           
              improve models of the active regions modulations of                            
              irradiance and to ascertain the relative importance                            
              between global faculae and the global magnetic                                 
              network.
