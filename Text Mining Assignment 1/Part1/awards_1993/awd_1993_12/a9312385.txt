Abstract    :
              9312385   Singleton       Hollins College requests support from NSF for
              connection of  its campus network to VERnet.  VERnet is the midlevel network 
              located in the state of Virginia. VERnet will provide operations  management
              and information services and it will give Hollins  College connection to the
              NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million  bits per second) National Backbone
              network.       The College needs greater functionality and network speed to  be
              able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file  transfers along with
              being able to implement a more reliable mail  system. Students and faculty
              research will benefit from the link.   This is also a unique opportunity for
              the school to explore  innovative educational resources.  ***
