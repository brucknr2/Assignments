Abstract    :
              9312063  Tripathy  A focussed program of scientific research into the molecular 
              -level engineering of a novel class of nonlinear optical  polymers will be
              carried out.  The major new direction of  this research is into multicomponent
              interpenetrating  polymer networks as a new approach to thermostable second- 
              order nonlinear optical polymers. In addition to addressing  fundamental
              question about solid-state reactions in electric-  field-induced ordered
              reactant media and stability of the  poled order in crosslinked
              interpenetrating networks,  technologically relevant materials synthesis,
              processing,  and fabrication will be carried out in this important area.  ***
