Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This SGER proposal is to complete development of the "Dynamic                  
              Clamp" which is a software tool for on-line electrophysiological               
              analysis of neurons and neuronal circuits.  Present microelectrode             
              techniques make it possible to record membrane potential changes in            
              response to intrinsic neuronal activity and to injected current,               
              and to record local membrane currents under voltage clamp.  The                
              dynamic clamp provides a significant advance for recording and                 
              experimental manipulation of neuronal and network responses by                 
              making it possible to simulate evoked and voltage-dependent                    
              conductance changes in a neuron in real time during an experiment.             
              This makes it possible to simulate an electrical or chemical                   
              synaptic connection between two neurons, to simulate the effect of             
              a neuromodulator substance, and to simulate the effect of voltage-             
              dependent membrane currents.  Currents or synapses can be added or             
              subtracted or changed in a neuron, and the effect of these                     
              manipulations can be directly assessed.  This support will enable              
              the P.I. to complete the development and testing of the software,              
              including a "user-friendly" interface.  The P.I. has already                   
              alerted the community to the existence of the Dynamic Clamp through            
              a cover picture on the current issue of the Journal of                         
              Neurophysiology, and a report on its use.  The P.I. has also                   
              established mechanisms for distribution and technical support of               
              the software.***//
