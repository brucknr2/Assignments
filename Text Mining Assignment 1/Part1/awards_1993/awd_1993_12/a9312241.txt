Abstract    :
              9312241  Vafa  Description:  This is a group travel proposal  for nine U.S.
              physicists to attend the Second  International Colloquium on Modern Quantum 
              Field Theory, at the Tata Institute of  Fundamental Research, Bombay, India,
              January 5-  11, 1994.  This is a unique gathering at  India's premier
              institution where some of the  world's most eminent physicists will be 
              discussing topical areas in modern theoretical  physics.  Cumrun Vafa, Lyman
              Laboratory,  Harvard University, and Sumit Das, Tata  Institute of Fundamental
              Research, Bombay are  the principal organizers.  Subjects to be  covered at the
              meeting include String Theory,  Quantum Gravity, Lattice Field Theories, 
              Stochastic Processes, Field Theoretic Aspects  of Condensed Matter Physics and
              Mathematics and  Quantun Field Theory.  In each of these areas,  a growing
              number of Indian physicists are  making important contributions in a sustained 
               manner.   Scope: There is a high level of interaction  between Indian
              physicists and their U.S.  colleagues, many of which have resulted in  fruitful
              exchanges of ideas and collaborations,  and are likely to continue to foster 
              significant developments in the future.       The colloquium will serve the
              dual purpose of  getting together leading experts in a given  area and
              fostering interaction across areas.   The meeting will benefit students and 
              researchers from India and neighboring  countries and is likely to foster
              significant  collaborations between U.S. and Indian  scientists.     ***
