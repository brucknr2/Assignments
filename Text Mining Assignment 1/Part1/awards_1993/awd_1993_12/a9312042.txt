Abstract    :
              9312042  Stephens, L    Rural economies in developing nations are fundamentally
              altered by a variety of  world and local events such as variation in demand for
              raw commodities or land  reforms.  This project will evaluate the impact of the
              recent free trade agreement  between the US and Mexico and ejido restructuring
              on gender and family  relations in three sectors: rural ejido communities,
              non-ejido rural subsistence  communities, and in the urban informal sector. 
              Research will focus on regional  factors such a changing employment
              availability, land prices and family  dynamics in six sites.  The investigator
              predicts that economic restructuring in  Mexico will have different effects on
              the rural and urban poor in relation to  region, gender, age, and ethnicity. 
              The specific topics to be explored in local  reserach sites include the
              gendered division of labor, household, marital and  family relationships,
              migration patterns, political mobilization, and participation in  community
              cultural institutions.  Research will be eventually be extended to a  total of
              six sites in Oaxaca and Nayarit.  This Research Planning Grant for  Women
              Scientists requests funding for the first 18 months of a five year project  to
              facilitate a pilot study in the state of Oaxaca and to allow the principle 
              investigator time to gather background data to write a three-year NSF proposal 
              to complete the full project.    Specific planning activities include: (1)
              spending part of the 1993-94 summer  and academic year in Oaxaca, Mexico to
              institute a pilot study in three  communities; (2) spending one month during
              the 1994-95 academic year at the  Center for US-Mexican Studies in San Diego,
              California using the data base on  ejido household to frame questions and
              collect background data for the states  of Oaxaca and Nayarit; (3) spending
              part of the investigator's sabbatical year,  1994-95 writing a multi-year NSF
              proposal to fund the remaining three years of  this project; and (4) reading
              relevant materials available in Me xico and  communication with scholars
              involved in research on agrarian restructuring in  Mexico during the 18 month
              planning period.   ***
