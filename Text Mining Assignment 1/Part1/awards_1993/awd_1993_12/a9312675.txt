Abstract    :
              S. L. Soo   Abstract    measurements of particle velocities, mixture density and
              particle size distribution in wavy horizontal and turbulent vertical gas-solid
              mixture pipe flow will be performed with laser Doppler  velocimetry (LDV) and
              phase Doppler particle analyzer (PDPA).  means, fluctuations, and cross-
              correlations of the velocity and density fluctuations will be obtained.  The
              results will be interpreted in the context of time averaging equations of
              two-phase flow and particle-fluid interaction models.  Particle of 0.05, 0.2
              and 0.45 mm will be used in experiments, at solids to gas mass flow ratios up
              to 12.    The proposed work is essential for the development of basic
              understanding and modeling in gas-solids two-phase turbulent flow, with
              application in processing, minerals and food industry.  The measurements are
              possible by recent developments in two-phase flow instrumentation.  ***
