Abstract    :
              9312930  Suiter    AGI will continue and expand the scope of its geoscience
              undergraduate minority scholarship  program with the addition of several new
              elements.  In 1993-96, AGI will award 70 to 80  scholarships annually, with
              awards averaging $2,500 per award.  The proposed program is  national in scope
              with scholars being evaluated and selected through a competitive process.  In 
              addition to increasing the number of scholarships awarded, AGI will provide new
              features in the  program that will address many of the recognized barriers to
              ethnic minority participation.    AGI will also increase its monitoring and
              evaluation of the program through periodic and  systematic review by
              participants, program staff, and advisory personnel.
