Abstract    :
              9312674  Wanser  We plan to investigate, experimentally and theoretically, the
              fundamental performance limits of fiber optic interferometers and methods for
              improving fiber optic gyroscopes and sensors employing nonlinear phase
              transducers.  Phase noise in Mach Zehnder, and polarization fade free Michelson
              interferometers will be measured at 300 K and 77 K, and compared to a recent
              theory.  The phase noise in novel polarization stabilized fiber optic ring
              resonator interferometers will be investigated both experimentally and
              theoretically. The minimum detectable phase shift of a novel double pass ring
              resonator configuration for comparable (short) length interferometers.  Sources
              of noise, residual signals and offset in nonlinear magnetostrictive transducers
              will be investigated experimentally and theoretically.  Novel methods of
              transducer bias, dithering, and interferometer signal demodulation and feedback
              stabilization will be employed.  A nonlinear driven parametric oscillator model
              of the magnetic transducer will be developed to study the generation of
              subharmonics and nonlinear noise, and the role played by nonlinearity in
              generation of residual signals.  The final area to be addressed is performance
              improvements in fiber optic gyroscopes and production and measurement of
              ultralow degree of polarization (P-10-5).  These improvements are also expected
              to lower the cost and improve maunfacturability and usability of fiber optic
              gyroscopes by elimination of some components, and substantial reduction of
              serve performance specifications on others.  ***
