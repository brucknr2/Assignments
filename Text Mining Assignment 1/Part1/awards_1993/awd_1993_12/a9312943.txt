Abstract    :
              The purpose of this task is to update, develop, and analyze

              for Biological Studies' Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in                   
              Plant Biology Program.  Through this task order, N-BioS will make              
              a formal assessment of this Program and present its findings in a              
              final report.  This report will include an analysis of the                     
              Fellowship recipients, a detailed analysis of the careers of                   
              those Fellows who received their awards between 1983 and 1987,                 
              and recommendations for the future of the Program.
