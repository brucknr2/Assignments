Abstract    :
              9312694  Lee       Because of the monsoon-driven seasonality of primary 
              production in the Arabian Sea, the Arabian Sea Process Study  affords an
              opportunity to follow a variety of biomarker compounds  from their point of
              origin in the photic zone to their eventual  burial and preservation in
              seafloor sediments.  In this project,  the principal investigators will sample
              and characterize some 100  different particulate biochemical compounds --
              lipids, pigments,  amino acids, and carbohydrates -- at their point of origin
              in the  surface ocean, through transformation in deeper water as they  settle
              in deeper water as they settle in particulate form to the  seafloor, and in
              surficial and subsurface sediments.  Analysis of  data collected during and
              between monsoon events will permit the  investigators to characterize the
              reactivity and transformations  of these organic substances and to assess their
              potential for  sedimentary preservation as marine paleoenvironmental
              indicators.  ***
