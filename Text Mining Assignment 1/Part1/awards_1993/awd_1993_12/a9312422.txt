Abstract    :
                                                  9312422  Morkoc    Fundamental materials
              science and engineering issues of thin  dielectric films will be addressed
              using in situ growth and  diagnostics apparatus which exploits the advantages
              of both  chemical vapor deposition and molecular beam epitaxy; metal- 
              insulator-semiconductor structures based on group III-V GaAs and  InP
              semiconductors will be investigated.  Due to intrinsically  better transport
              properties of III-V semiconductors, advances in  the speed and power
              performance of microelectronic  devices/circuits are anticipated from this
              study.  One of the  likely beneficiaries is low-power consumption digital
              electronics  such as mobile communication systems. Moreover, this project, if 
              successful, can provide an alternative path to further size  reduction of Si
              devices for enhanced performance.  %%%  To date, semiconductors other than
              silicon have resisted  implementation into the class of transistors, known as
              the metal  oxide field effect transistor, that has been responsible for the 
              commercial electronics revolution.  Using modern materials-growth  and in situ
              surface science  diagnostic techniques, dielectrics  and semiconductors with
              intrinsically higher potential (than  silicon) for high speed field effect
              transistor applications will  be studied.  If successful, the project will have
              considerable  beneficial impact on digital electronics systems such as wireless
               personal mobile communication systems; telecommunications, in  general;
              information processing; and computing.  ***
