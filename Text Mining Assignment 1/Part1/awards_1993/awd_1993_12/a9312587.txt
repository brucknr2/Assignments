Abstract    :
              9312587  Shayman       The proposed research project deals with supervisory
              control  of nondeterministic discrete event systems.  Discrete event  systems
              are systems which involve quantities which take on a  discrete set of values
              and which are constant except at discrete  times when events occur in the
              system.  Examples include  communication networks, intelligent vehicle highway
              systems,  manufacturing systems and computer programs.  Supervisory control 
              theory was developed to provide a mathematical framework for the  design of
              controllers for such systems in order to meet various  qualitative constraints.
                    A research program on the supervisory control of  nondeterministic
              systems will be undertaken.  Supervisory control  of both untimed and timed
              systems will be studied under complete  as well as partial observation. 
              Centralized as well as  decentralized, hierarchical and modular control
              techniques will  be developed.  Efficient computational techniques to verify
              the  existence of supervisors, to synthesize them when they exist and  to
              synthesize minimally restrictive supervisors will be obtained.   Both off-line
              and on-line computational techniques will be  considered.  The results will be
              applied to the problem of  integrated management of communication networks.
