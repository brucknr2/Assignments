Abstract    :
              9312398  Tong  The research described in this project will utilize laser light 
              scattering techniques to study statistical properties of the local  velocity,
              the relative velocity and the local vorticity fields of  turbulent
              Rayleigh-Benard (RB) convection in water.  The  experiments will aim at finding
              and testing scaling laws if  velocity and vorticity statistics over varying
              Rayleigh numbers and  length scales in the turbulent core region and near
              thermal and  viscous boundary layers.  Special attention will be given to the 
              intermittent nature of velocity fluctuations and to correlations  between
              coherent structure and the probability density functions  for the velocities
              and the vorticity.  The project will provide a  body of reliable data to test
              current theories for turbulent RB  convection.  The velocity and vorticity
              measurements will  complement a wealth of temperature measurements.  %%%  This
              project will utilize laser light scattering techniques to  study statistical
              properties of turbulent motion in thermal  convection.  The project is of
              fundamental interest for  understanding the basic statistical properties of
              thermal  turbulence, and it is also relevant to many technological 
              applications for effective heat transfer.  Understanding heat  transport
              phenomena in turbulent convection can shed new light on  the subject
              potentially lead to technological improvements in  various industrial
              applications ranging from heat exchanges in  nuclear reactors to reentry
              vehicles.  ***
