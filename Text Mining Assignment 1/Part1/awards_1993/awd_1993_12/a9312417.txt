              The Sixth Engineering Foundation Conference on Risk-Based Decision-Making will
              take place on October 31-November 6, 1993, in Santa Barbara, CA.  The purpose
              of the conference is to address issues of public decision-making in which risk
              analysis plays a prominent role and  will; 1) evaluate current risk assessment
              issues confronting water resources planners and pertinent areas of uncertainty;
              2) identify the requirements and procedures currently promoted by the
              engineering professions which are in use by Federal and State agencies, 3)
              review and evaluate decision and analysis models/methods which can explicitly
              incorporate risk preferences; and 4) develop information exchange mechanisms. 
              Proceedings of this conference will be published and disseminated to the
              research and practicing engineers, and to private and public organizations as
              done in previous occasions. ***        x   \        P    C
