Abstract    :
              9312642  Andreas  The proposed project is the continuation of the analysis of
              the  atmospheric boundary layer data set obtained in the austral winter  1992
              from the joint U.S.-Russian Ice Camp in the Weddell Sea.  The  collaborative
              field effort resulted in a comprehensive data set  describing the atmospheric
              boundary layer under generally stable  conditions.  The analysis will be
              directed primarily at evaluating  the surface energy budget as the end point of
              the process of energy  transfer from the ocean through the ice into the
              atmosphere, and at  studying the air-ice momentum exchange as part of the
              larger  scientific question of how the sea ice cover responds to the  dynamics
              of the atmosphere and the ocean.  ***
