Abstract    :
              9312167  Freed  In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program 
              of the Chemistry Division, Freed will pursue electron spin  resonance (ESR)
              studies of the dynamics of free radicals in  fluids, on surfaces, and in
              related systems.  New relaxation  and structural techniques will be used, and
              the necessary  theoretical frameworks for understanding these experiments will 
              be developed and extended.  Two-dimensional Fourier transform  (2D-FT) ESR,
              2D-FT electron-electron double resonance  (2D-ELDOR), spin-echo correlation
              spectroscopy  (SECSY)-ESR ,  dynamic imaging of diffusion  (DID)-ESR , and
              far-infrared (FIR)  ESR are among the techniques to be used.  %%%  In this
              project Freed will develop several new techniques for  electron spin resonance
              (ESR) which closely parallel new  techniques in nuclear magnetic resonance
              (NMR).  These new  methods will allow ESR to examine molecular structure and 
              motions more readily in fluids and on surfaces.  Such studies  will undoubtedly
              impact many areas of chemistry, biology, and  materials science.  ***
