Abstract    :
              Dwoskin         The Computer Science and Telecommunications Board and the 
              Manufacturing Studies Board are developing a set of research  directions for
              the National Science Foundation in support of  better development and
              application of information technology for  manufacturing.  They have
              established a study committee to  develop a well-defined set of recommendations
              for research.  The  committee includes representatives from private
              manufacturing  industries, representatives from computer software companies,
              and  academics from computer science and other relevant disciplines.   The
              committee will produce two reports on its findings.
