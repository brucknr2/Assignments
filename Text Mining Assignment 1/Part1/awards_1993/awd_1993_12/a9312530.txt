Abstract    :
              9312530  Tessema  This project will investigate the influence of stress on the 
              electronic properties of highly anisotropic materials such as  superconductors
              and materials showing charge denity wave (CDW)  behavior.  The materials under
              investigation include NbSe3, which  exhibits CDW properties, and Tl2Mo6Se6, a
              highly anisotropic quasi  one dimensional superconductor.  The effect of stress
              on transport  and magneto-transport properties of the materials will be 
              investigated.  Of particular interest is the stress-induced metal- 
              to-insulator transition in the ternary selenides.  In addition, the 
              combination of high magnetic fields and stress are proposed to  search for a
              superconducting transition in the ternary selenides.   These experiments will
              provide fundamental information concerning  relations between Fermi surface
              shape and CDW enhancement.  %%%  This project will investigate the effects of
              stress (or squeezing)  on the magnetic and electronic properties of materials
              such as  binary and ternary selenides that have highly anisotropic  electrical
              properties.  The use of stress to modulate the  electrical properties of
              materials is of fundamental interest and  also could lead to new materials of
              technological interest.  In  addition, experiments are proposed in which very
              high magnetic  fields will be used in an attempt to induce superconductivity in
              a  material.  These experiments would be of fundamental and  technologic
              importance,  since in most materials, high magnetic  fields are incompatible
              with superconducting transport properties.  ***
