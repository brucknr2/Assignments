Abstract    :
              9312413  Schrock  This renewal award is made in the Advanced Materials and 
              Processing Program in support of the collaborative research of  Professors
              Schrock, Cohen and Silbey at the Massachusetts  Institute of Technology.
              Support is provided by The Divisions  of Chemistry and Materials Research. The
              focus of the research  is the synthesis of semiconductor clusters of lead and
              cadmium  sulfides of unusual shape, size and distribution. The approach  will
              be to synthesize metal carboxylate-containing block  copolymers of a particular
              morphology and convert them into  metal sulfide clusters by treatment with
              hydrogen sulfide. New  metal-containing monomers and catalysts will be
              synthesized for  the development of new semiconductor-precursor polymers. More 
              general approaches to semiconductor cluster synthesis including  aqueous
              methods will be explored. In concert with experiments,  the application of
              theoretical methods to study the optical  absorption, fluoresence and
              photoelectron spectra of  semiconductor crystallites as a function of their
              size, shape  and surface, will be developed.  %%%  Careful control of the size
              and shape of semiconductor clusters  will permit the synthesis of advanced
              materials with  predictable and controllable electronic and optical properties.
