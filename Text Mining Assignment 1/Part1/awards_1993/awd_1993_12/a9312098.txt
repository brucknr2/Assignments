Abstract    :
              9312098  Glimm       This award support three industrial postdoctoral
              researchers  to work both in a university research setting and in an 
              industrial research environment.  The research that will occupy  the
              postdoctoral scholars involves the application of methods  from
              high-performance computing and nonlinear, combinatorial,  algorithmic,
              statistical, and stochastic analyses to the  efficient design and manufacture
              of high-technology products.       The award nurtures an alliance between
              industrial users of  technology and the university research community.  The
              goal is to  assist industry in its search for cost-effective access to vital 
              technology and allow universities to determine and develop basic  research
              directions relevant to modern industrial processes.  The  research topics
              include: (1) Industrial fabrication with  advanced materials and processes, (2)
              Geometric algorithms for  robotics and manufacturing, (3)Computational geometry
              for virtual  reality, (4) Drug design, and (5) Education and outreach for 
              industrial mathematics.  The award has substantial matching funds  from
              industry.
