Abstract    :
              9312177  Firestein    This two-year award will support U.S.-Italy cooperative
              research  between Stuart Firestein of Columbia University, and Anna Menini  of
              the University of Genoa in Italy.  They will collaborate on  stimulus-response
              relations in olfactory neurons.       Signal transduction systems are often
              measured by dose-response  relationships.  This critical quantitative measure
              is unavailable  for olfactory receptors, due largely to the difficulty of 
              accurately delivering a stimulus of known concentration.  This  project seeks
              to provide this data by applying a novel means of  stimulus delivery, in which
              a single living cell can be  completely immersed in a particular odor solution
              while its  electrical response is monitored.  From this data, it will be 
              possible to construct the dose-response relations of individual  olfactory
              cells to a variety of odor stimuli.    Both investigators are established and
              highly regarded, the  problem is fundamental to sensory neuroscience, and the 
              collaboration exploits complementary skills with a novel and  unique approach. 
              The collaboration has the potential to have a  major impact on understanding
              chemosensory functions.  * * *
