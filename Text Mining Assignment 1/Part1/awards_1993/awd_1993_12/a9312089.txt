Abstract    :
              9312089  Brand       This project establishes an Arizona statewide networking 
              consortium, connects eight rural community colleges to NSFNET, and  provides
              self-sufficiency training for the new campuses and  connectivity to the network
              for 24 months.  Faculty and students  will benefit from access to the resources
              of the Internet,  including libraries and supercomputers.  In addition, they
              will be  able to communicate and collaborate with colleagues at other 
              institutions in pursuit of research and educational projects.  The  award
              provides partial support of the project for two years.  ***
