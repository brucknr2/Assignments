Abstract    :
              9312148  Van Altena    This award will fund the construction of a Speckle
              Interferometer  and station it at the Cesco Observatory of the Yale Southern 
              Observatory and the University of San Juan at El Leoncito,  Argentina.  The
              purpose of this instrument is to rectify the large  imbalance in the
              hemispheric distribution of modern observations of  close visual binaries.  The
              new observations, in combination with  those from the pioneering work of
              Finsen, will lead to a  significant improvement in the knowledge of the lower
              part of the  mass luminosity relation.  Improved masses can provide needed 
              constraints to stellar structure and evolution calculations and  their
              comparison with observations.  ***
