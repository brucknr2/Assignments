Abstract    :
              9312890  Wimberly  Previous research supported by the National Science
              Foundation  led to important information on the adhesion characteristics of 
              fouling organisms and the resulting effect on the hydrodynamic  drag of flat
              plates.  This research is an extension of this work  with the intention of
              first, continuing the investigation of the  adhesion characteristics of
              Enteromorpha clathrata and thus  characterizing the effects of antifouling
              paints on algal growth  and adhesion, and secondly, investigating the effects
              of rapidly  growing Enteromorpha clathrata cultures to lifting surfaces  coated
              with tributyltin-based paints.  The algal growth patterns  on lifting surfaces
              in relation to several environmental  conditions such as light intensity and
              quality, pH, salinity,  temperature, nutrient levels and culture age will be 
              investigated.  The results will then be used to mathematically  model the
              consequent impact on flow field cavitation, the  hydrodynamic response and
              control characteristics of underwater  lifting surfaces and support structures.
