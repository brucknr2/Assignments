Abstract    :
                     9312260  Cohen   This project involves the dissertation research of a
              student in  cultural anthropology from Columbia University.  The student is 
              studying how Chinese peasants communicate values about gender  relations
              through their linguistic forms of proverbs and folk  sayings.  The sayings are
              thought of as representing traditional  wisdom and shared folk experience, and
              are used to sanction  behavior.  Using household surveys, personal interviews, 
              elicitation of life histories and participant observation as well  as archival
              research, the project will describe how rural Chinese  women are changing
              gender relations in the face of tradition.     This research is important
              because it sheds light on the changing  roles of women and men in traditional
              societies.  With changes in  employment opportunities, traditional gender roles
              change all  over the world, and this one case study of how the changes are 
              instituted in a traditional society will provide valuable  comparative material
              to understand similar processes in different  places.  In addition dissertation
              research increases the  scientific capacity of the nation.  ***
