Abstract    :
                                                  9312947  Dupuis    Research will be carried
              out to develop a fundamental  understanding of conventional and low temperature
              metalorganic  chemical vapor epitaxial materials growth and novel device 
              processing techniques for wide-bandgap III-V compound  semiconductors in the
              system consisting of the AlGaInN quaternary  and related ternary and binary
              alloys.  Lattice-matched and  intentionally lattice-mismatched heteroepitaxial
              heterostructures  will be grown in this materials system using both
              low-pressure  metalorganic chemical vapor deposition, and low-temperature 
              epitaxial growth by flow-rate modulation.  In addition, this  program will
              study the fundamental structural, electronic, and  optical materials
              properties, as well as the heterojunction band  alignments of these materials. 
              %%%  The primary goal of this program is to develop a 
              fundamental-understanding of the epitaxial growth, processing,  and properties
              of wide bandgap semiconductor materials so that  they can be exploited in the
              realization of a variety of advanced  electronic and photonic devices. This
              research program is  strongly coupled to direct collaborative efforts with US 
              optoelectronic industrial research and development groups.  An  important
              feature of the program is the training of graduate and  undergraduate students
              in a fundamentally and technologically  significant area of materials and
              processing research.  This  research will contribute to improving the general
              performance of  advanced devices and integrated circuits used in computing, 
              information processing, and telecommunications.  ***
