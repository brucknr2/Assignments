Abstract    :
              9312449  Sanders       The use of isentropic potential vorticity as a tool for 
              studying the structure and evolution of synoptic-scale atmospheric  phenomena
              is very much "in vogue".  The conservation of potential  vorticity is a key
              assumption.  In a recently completed pilot study  using operational analyses
              from the National Meteorological Center,  Dr. Sanders found evidence suggesting
              this assumption is not valid.   Under this award, he will further extend his
              initial study using  higher temporal and spatial resolution information.  As
              part of his  investigation, he will attempt to relate changes in potential 
              vorticity to sub-grid scale processes in the observed behavior of  synoptic
              systems.       Besides its potential for contributing to improved 
              understanding of the physical processes involved in synoptic  weather systems,
              the research will force the community to  scrutinize and perhaps better
              understand the uses and limitations  of so-called "PV thinking".  ***
