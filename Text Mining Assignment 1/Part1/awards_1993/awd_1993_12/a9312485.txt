              This is an SGER request to augment the ongoing research of                     
              Kochanska (DBS-9209559) in her study the development of                        
              conscience in children.  Toddlers and their mothers are currently              
              being studied using observations, reports, and experimental                    
              paradigms.  Kochanska's research considers the role of                         
              temperament in moral development and brings together parental                  
              socialization and children's temperatment as influences in the                 
              early formation of conscience.                                                 
                                                                                             
              In the SGER request, Fowles will collaborate with Kochanska to                 
              examine the physiological correlates of conscience development.                
              Specifically, he will look at electrodermal reactivity, which has              
              been considered an index of individual temperamental qualities.                
              He will also measure heart rate.  This collaboration is part of a              
              strong trend in the field to add biological measurement to the                 
              study of personality development.                                              
                                                                                             
              Imaginative procedures have been developed to carry out this                   
              research.  A "space lab" will be used as the setting with T-                   
              shirts for the children carrying the logo: "University of Iowa                 
              Astronaut Training".  A special chair with foot and arm rests                  
              will be used; the chair can be slightly tipped back to simulate                
              the astronaut-type sitting position.  These procedures have been               
              developed in consultation with Nancy Eisenberg, Jerry Kagan, and               
              Nathan Fox, researchers who have studied physiological processes               
              in small children.                                                             
                                                                                             
              The physiological assessments will be tied to other measures                   
              planned for the fall of 1993.  This timeliness is the reason for               
              the SGER application, with its quick turn-around time.                         
                                                                                             
              Program Director recommends an award of $49,569, one half of                   
              which ($24,785) should come from the CPL cluster reserve, with                 
              the remaining funds from the Social Psychology program.
