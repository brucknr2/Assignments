Abstract    :
              9312099  Weinstein    This is a CRISP (Combined Research - industrial Sabbatical
              Program)  proposal for a joint project between the CUNY City College and  EXXON
              R&D.  The main objective is experimental description of flow  microstructure in
              two-phase gas-powder flow in high velocity  fluidized beds.  X-ray attenuation
              and pressure measurements will  be made in a high velocity fluidized bed riser,
              a down-flow pipe,  and gas jets into upflowing ga-solid mixtures.  Normal
              stress  within solid phase will be determined in a collapsing fluidized  bed. 
              The data on the mean and fluctuating velocities and solid  fractions will be
              compared to available models.  It is expected  that the project will yield
              fundamental results on the flow  structure in high velocity and bubbly
              fluidized beds, promote a  micromechanical approach to understand the basic
              flow patterns, and  construct a data base to calibrate CFD simulation codes. 
              The  interpretation of the fluctuating quantities, their correlations,  power
              spectra, and turbulence length scales, will contributed to  the validation of
              existing models.  Better understanding of the  basic flow mechanisms, as well
              as improved scale up and design  methods of high velocity and bubbly fluidized
              beds are expected.  ***
