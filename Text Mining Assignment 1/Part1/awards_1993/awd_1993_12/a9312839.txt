Abstract    :
              9312839  Dubson    Technical abstract:  An experimental and theoretical study
              will be  carried out of the kinetics of surface self-diffusion and mass 
              transport on metal surfaces.  The thermal stability of metal films  and small
              metal structures will also be investigated.  Variable  temperature (4.0-540K)
              scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) will be  used to study the evolution of
              structures on the surface of noble  metals.  These structures will include
              those that are naturally  occuring in polycrystalline films as well as
              lithographically  fabricated structures in single-crystal samples.  The effect
              of  growth conditions on the critical length csale at which the film 
              morphology changes from a compact island structure to percolation  will be
              probed using electron microscopy.  In a related study, a  novel submicron
              resistance probe, called electron beam resistance  imaging, will be used in
              combination with atomic force microscopy  (AFM) to identify and characterize
              the initiation sites of  electrical failure in submicron metal lines.   
              Non-technical abstract:  Any metal surface which is not flat is in  a
              non-equilibrium state and will attempt to relax toward flatness.   The
              mechanism of this relaxation is often surface diffusion of  atoms.  This
              process can affect the lifetime of computer chips or  any other
              lithographically fabricated metal structure.  Scanning  tunneling microscopy
              and scanning electron microscopy will be used  to study surface diffusion of
              atoms on metals and the consequent  evolution of the structure of metal films
              and small metal  structures.  Relevant questions to be asked in this context
              are:   How does a corrugated metal surface decay?  How does the decay time 
              depend on the size of the corrugations?  How thick should a metal  film be do
              that it has no holes?   Will holes develop in such a  film when it is heated?
