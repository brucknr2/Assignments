Abstract    :
              9312202  CECI  This research will address several questions about the capacity
              of  children to serve as witnesses in legal proceedings, including  criminal
              trials, juvenile court hearings, and civil proceedings  such as family courts. 
              There has been much controversy in this  area because children are often the
              only witnesses to events  resulting in criminal charges that identify them as
              victims, and  they are frequently in the middle of bitter divorce cases.  The 
              courts have made procedural rulings but the scientific basis for  these rulings
              has been challenged.  This research will provide some  answers to some
              questions in this complex field by examining the  extent to which childrens'
              memories are susceptible to suggestion  and the effectiveness of investigative
              techniques.  The research  will not exhaust the questions to be examined or the
              different  methodological approaches that might be used, but it represents a 
              solid beginning in an important area of psychology and law.    The project is
              comprised of three experimental studies involving  pre-school age children: (1)
              childrens' capacity to distinguish in  memory between true and false events,
              (2) childrens' recollection  of stressful events after a series of interviews
              about them,  including the use of anatomical dolls, and (3) the effects, on the
               accuracy of childrens' testimony and on jurors' perceptions of  their
              credibility, of shielding children from the alleged  perpetrator during
              testimony.  This research will make an important  empirical and theoretical
              contribution to scientific knowledge  about childrens' reports, and a
              significant contribution to sound  legal practice and the reliability of legal
              processes.  ***
