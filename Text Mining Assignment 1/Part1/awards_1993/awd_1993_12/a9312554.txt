Abstract    :
              9312554  Georgakis    This award provides funding the first year of a three-year
               continuing award for a "Self-Sufficient Partnership award for  Research " at
              Lehigh University's Industry/University Cooperative  Research Center for
              Chemical Modelling and Control.  The Center has  demonstrated successful
              research support from industrial members  and has met the review criteria of
              I/UCRC Self-Sufficient  Partnership Program.      Funding is also provided to
              support an evaluator at the Center to  continue the evaluation responsibility
              on monitoring the  industry/university interaction for the Center.     
              Additional funding is provided for a woman undergraduate student to  aid the
              Center in its's ongoing research activities.        The U.S. Department of
              Energy's Environmental Restoration and Waste  Management Office has provided
              funding to obtain a non-voting  membership in the Center.    The Program
              Manager recommends Lehigh University be awarded:   $30,000 for the first year
              of a three-year continuing award; $8,000  to support an evaluator at the center
              for one year; $10,000 for one  year with funds provided by the Department of
              Energy; and $5,000  for one year to support an undergraduate student at the
              Center.    Near the end of each 12-month period, the Program Manager and/or 
              the Division Director of the Engineering Education Centers Division  will
              review the progress of the Center on a number of renewal  criteria
              requirements, including the following:  1) the extent to  which the
              university/industry interaction is developing; 2) the  extent to which the
              support base is developing; and 3) the extent  to which a robust research
              program is developing.  If the review is  satisfactory, the Program Manager
              will recommend support for the  next period of this continuing award.
