Abstract    :
              9312476  Fowler  This research studies low-dimensional strongly interacting
              magnetic  and electronic systems which are increasingly important in  condensed
              matter physics for understanding high temperature  superconductivity,
              mesoscopic systems and anisotropic materials.   The approach uses exact
              solutions, usually solved by the Bethe  Ansatz, of one-dimensional strongly
              interacting models which are  physically plausible.  However, the exact
              solutions for these so-  called integrable systems are often difficult to
              interpret  physically and apply to higher dimension systems.  Systems which 
              will be studied during the grant period include the XXZ spin chain, 
              sine-Gordon thermodynamics, Calogero-type systems and the Toda  lattice.  %%% 
              The theoretical research being done on this grant uses highly   mathematical
              techniques to obtain exact solutions of model physical  systems.  In most
              cases, these exact solutions can only be obtained  in dimensions lower than the
              three dimensions in which we live.   Thus, the applicability of these solutions
              to the real world is not  always clear.  On the other hand, it is nearly
              impossible so far to  obtain exact solutions of three-dimensional systems and
              many  materials have characteristics of lower dimensional systems.  Thus, 
              judicious use of exact solutions in lower dimensions can help us  understand
              properties of real physical systems.  This is  particularly the case with high
              temperature superconductors,  certain mesoscopic electronic devices and
              anisotropic materials in  general.  ***
