Abstract    :
              9312300  Moll    This proposal requests support for the travel of graduate 
              students, post doctoral students and young investigators to  attend and present
              their research at the Second World Congress of  Herpetology in Adelaide,
              Australia.  Attendance at this meeting,  which covers a variety of presentation
              on the biology, ecology  and biodiversity of amphibians and reptiles, would be
              valuable to  these young scientists.  ***
