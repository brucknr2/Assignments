Abstract    :
                  9312954  Paulson  The goal is to develop and validate new technology and 
              methodology that will enable investigators and AEC industry  planners to use
              the computer to plan projects in detail--including  processing, waiting and
              move activities --and to classify planned  activities  as value-adding (VA) or
              non-VA.  The research methods  will include careful observation and analysis of
              actual  construction processes.  Then based on this observation and some of 
              prior work, PI's will develop theories of how to do detailed  planning, to
              infer whether activities add value, and to suggest  plan options that reduce or
              eliminate non-VA activity.  Using  Artificial Intelligence (AI) modeling
              techniques, PI's will build  symbolic models to implement that theory.  In
              addition, will build  interactive graphic user interfaces to help investigators
              do  careful validation to compare observation, theoretical  prediction  about
              plans for specific projects, and the actual output of the  planner.
