Abstract    :
              9312734  Bigzadeh       The main objective of the project is to obtain an
              effective  heat transfer coefficient on a metal strand in the secondary 
              cooling zone during the continuous casting process.  Previous  research
              indicates that many cooling processes in this zone have a  pronounced effect on
              the quality of the cast metal.  Two different  experimental setups will be
              designed and constructed to satisfy the  special requirements of the two phases
              of the experimental study.  During the experiment, spray water and spray (air
              and water)  velocities will be measured.  This will be achieved by the three- 
              dimensional Laser Doppler Anemometer and Particle Dynamic Analyzer  system (3-D
              LDA/PDA).  Thermocouples with an associated HP data  acquisition system will be
              applied to measure the temperature  distribution.  A high resolution photo
              camera will be used to  obtain information during the droplet impinging
              process.  X-ray  diffraction and Auger experiments will be used in order to 
              determine the composition and the structure of the surface scale.   A suitable
              method of curve fitting will be used to develop the  correlation equation for
              determining the heat transfer coefficient  for the metal strand in the
              secondary cooling zone during the  continuous casting process.       Improved
              understanding of the transfer of heat to the castings  may allow higher quality
              continuously cost metals to be produced,  reducing the cost and improving the
              performance of metal sheet  stock.
