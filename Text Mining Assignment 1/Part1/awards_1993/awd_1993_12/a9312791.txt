Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Technical Narrative:                                                           
                                                                                             
              Whereas the effects of Maghribi labor migration                                
              on Europe have been extensively studied, this                                  
              project focuses on the important but relatively                                
              little studied effects of international migration                              
              on the Maghrib itself.  This proposed conference                               
              and workshop, organized by the American Institute                              
              for Maghribi Studies and the University of Tunis,                              
              is scheduled for 21-25 June 1993 in Tunis,                                     
              Tunisia.  This activity will bring together                                    
              highly regarded experts from the U.S., Algeria,                                
              Morocco, and Tunisia representing a number of                                  
              fields in the social sciences. The stated                                      
              objectives of this joint meeting are to improve                                
              our knowledge of economic, political and socio-                                
              cultural effects of international labor migration                              
              on the Maghrib as well as reinforce and extend an                              
              international and interdisciplinary network of                                 
              American and Maghribi scholars that will endure                                
              beyond the project.  This project partially                                    
              supports the participation of approximately six                                
              U.S. and 18 North African scientists.                                          
              Participants will present papers that will be                                  
              compiled and published as a conference volume.                                 
                                                                                             
              This conference/workshop in social science                                     
              fulfills the program objective of advancing                                    
              scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts                               
              in the United States and North Africa to combine                               
              complementary talents and present research                                     
              results in areas of strong mutual interest and                                 
              competence.  This activity has an educational and                              
              outreach effort that has the potential for                                     
              generating new scientific activity and new                                     
              international linkages.
