Abstract    :
              9312918  Saltiel  Photoisomerization in olefins having one or more conjugated  
              double bonds will be studied. Progressively more complex   olefins will be
              studied, starting from stilbenes, through   1,6-diphenylhexatrienes to
              bacteriorhodopsin. The question   of diradicaloid versus zwitterionic twisted
              excited singlet   states will be examined in the simpler olefins by evaluating 
               medium, substituent, and structural effects on their   photochemistry and
              spectroscopy. Emission and product   quantum yields will be measured as
              functions of medium,   temperature, and excitation wavelength. The method of  
              principal component analysis with self-modeling (PCA-SM)   will be used to
              analyze these data. From this analysis,   intermediates and the mechanisms of
              the photoisomerization   processes will be determined.  %%%  This grant from
              the Organic Dynamics Program supports the   continuing work of Professor Jack
              Saltiel at Florida State   University. Mechanisms of rotation about
              carbon-carbon   double bonds that are induced by absorption of light in the  
              visible or ultraviolet region will be studied. Of particular   interest will be
              compounds that have alternating carbon-  carbon double and single bonds. The
              most complex molecule   in this study is bacteriorhodopsin, the visual  
              pigment. Light emission and product yields, based on the   amount of light
              absorbed, as a function of solvent,   temperature and excitation wavelength
              will be treated by a   modeling program. This treatment will allow a
              description of   the mechanism of these photoisomerization reactions.  ***
