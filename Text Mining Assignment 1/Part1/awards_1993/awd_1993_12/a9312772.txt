Abstract    :
              9312772  Hsuan  The objective of this research is to provide a data base of 
              knowledge and a prediction methodology in the area of long term  behavior of
              high density polyethylene (HPDE) geomembranes.  Its  primary focus is to
              predict the functional lifetime of the  material used in landfills and surface
              impoundments based on  short term accelerated laboratory tests.  Elevated
              temperature is  the principal acceleration factor.  Extrapolations to lower
              site  specific temperatures will be performed utilizing Arrhenius  modeling
              techniques.  Additionally the project will also attempt  to correlate between
              microscopic (i.e. changes in physical and  chemical properties) macroscopic
              (i.e. changes in mechanical  properties) behavior.  ***
