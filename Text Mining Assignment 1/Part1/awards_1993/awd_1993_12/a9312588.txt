Abstract    :
              Research will be performed on studies of fundamental interactions              
              and neutrino properties.  The Princeton University cyclotron will              
              be used to produce Ne19 which will be used in fundamental                      
              interaction studies to look for possible right handed currents                 
              and violation of time reversal invariance.  Low temperature                    
              micro-calorimetry techniques will be studied as a potential for                
              neutrino mass measurements.  Work will be performed on design and              
              testing of the containment vessel and liquid scintillator                      
              purification techniques for the Borexino solar neutrino detector               
              being developed in Italy.
