Abstract    :
                    ABSTRACT    P.I. John Fleagle  SBR-9312842    Fossil remains of human
              ancestors have been carefully examined anatomically to show that physical
              changes occurred through time and to attempt to reconstruct likely behaviors of
              the individuals and species concerned.  These fossils are usually not isolated
              finds: they are frequently found in association with other animal remains. 
              Studies of these animal remains have contributed a great deal to
              paleoanthropology, and have been used to reconstruct environments to determine
              the relative ages of sites that cannot be dated by absolute techniques.  Also,
              a picture of environmental and animal change or stability over long periods of
              time can be derived, over time, and across different areas.  This comparison is
              important for identifying possible ecological pressures that may have affected
              the evolution and behavioral ecology of different groups, including humans.   
              This dissertation project will compare the animal remains from early
              proto-human sites from the African Pliocene by using various quantitative
              methods of analysis with the goal of reconstructing the habitats and analyzing
              the ecological structure of these assemblages.  The information will be used to
              test current ideas regarding the behavior and adaptation of early proto-humans.
               The multiple analytic approaches to be employed will enable the development of
              more reliable interpretations of site similarities and differences.      ***
