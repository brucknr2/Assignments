Abstract    :
              9312634  Labes    In this project, two themes of importance to current liquid
              crystal  research are chosen for intensive study.  The first is to  understand
              how the macroscopic periodic structures which develop  during reorientation of
              liquid crystals affect their properties.   The fundamental study of the
              dynamics of formation and relaxation  of a liquid crystal polymer film will
              continue.  Annealing the  resulting solid films with and without tension and/or
              orienting  fields being applied will be investigated.  Both main chain and 
              side chain liquid crystal polymers will be examined.  Utilizing  optical
              probes, the fluctuations in the orientational ordering and  light scattering in
              these films under various processing conditions  will be studied.  The second
              theme involves the utilization of low  molecular weight nematic or cholesteric
              liquid crystals as reaction  media.  The investigations set the stage for
              attempts at chiral  synthesis in cholesteric media, for a mechanistic
              understanding of  the reactivity control at phase transitions, and for a
              systematic  exploration of the range of utility of liquid crystals as solvent 
              media.  ***
