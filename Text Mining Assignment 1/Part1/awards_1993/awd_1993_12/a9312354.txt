Abstract    :
              9312354  Schwenz       This project connects the west campus of the University
              of  Northern Colorado to NSFNET.  The connection is through the main  campus of
              the University, which already reaches NSFNET through  Colorado Supernet. 
              Faculty and students at the west campus will  benefit from access to the
              resources of the Internet, including  libraries and supercomputers.  In
              addition, they will be able to  communicate and collaborate with colleagues at
              other institutions  in pursuit of research and educational projects.  The award
               provides partial support of the project for one year.  ***
