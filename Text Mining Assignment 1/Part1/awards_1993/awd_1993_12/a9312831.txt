Abstract    :
              9312831  Pyle       This award supports the Nansen Arctic Drilling Program 
              Secretariat at Joint Oceanographic Institutions Incorporated.  Each  of ten
              participating nations is being asked to contribute to  support the activities
              of the Secretariat.  The Nansen Arctic  Drilling Program (NAD) is a major
              international research effort  designed to understand the geological evolution
              of the Arctic as  well as the history of Arctic environmental change.  This
              knowledge  will help predict the future of the Arctic basin and its effect on 
              global processes.  NAD is developing strategic plans for acquiring  long,
              high-resolution sediment cores and deep basement cores needed  to understand
              the Cenozoic and Mesozoic paleoceanography,  paleobiology, and structural
              history of the Arctic region.  These  cores are critical for scientists
              developing a comprehensive  understanding of global change.  This ambitious
              initiative  commemorates the pioneering work of Arctic explorer Fridtjof Nansen
               during the Fram expeditions (1893-1896).  ***
