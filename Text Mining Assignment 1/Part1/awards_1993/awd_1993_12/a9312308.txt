Abstract    :
              9312308  Higdon         The investigator develops robust spectral boundary
              integral  algorithms for three-dimensional transport problems in realistic 
              geometries.  Thw metjhods combine the high-order convergence of  spectral
              methods with the geometric adaptability of boundary  element methods. 
              Suitability for parallel computers is a central  aspect of the project.  The
              methods are applied to the study of  effective transport propertiues of fibrous
              porous media.       Boundary integral methods convert partial differential 
              equations, which describe a phenomenon of interest in a region,  into integral
              equations whose solutions are determined by certain  functions on the boundary
              of the region.  Spectral methods break  up  the boundary into smaller pieces,
              on which the functions are  approximated by polynomials of high degree. 
              Higher-degree  polynomials approximate the functions more accurately.  The use 
              of  polynomials allows for fast calculation of an approximate  solution.  For
              problems involving regions of complicated  geometry,  combining these ideas
              produces a computational method of  significant flexibility and accuracy.  The
              method is used to  calculate properties of fluid flow and transport in fibrous 
              porous  media.  Such problems arise throughout the chemical industry and  in 
              many fundamental biological contexts -- for example, in the pulp  and paper
              industry, and in the study of fluid circulation in  plants.
