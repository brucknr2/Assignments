Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9312892  CAPPELLI      This proposal represents one half of a
              collaborative research program between Mark Cappelli at Stanford and Iain Boyd
              at Cornell.  The PIs plan to study flowing, low density, chemically reacting
              plasmas generated by an arc expansion into vacuum for use in material
              synthesis.  The effort will include a combined experimental and numerical
              investigation.  The experimental investigation, which is the subject of this
              proposal, which will take place at Stanford, will include optical techniques
              such as laser induced fluorescence to measure number densities, temperatures
              and plasma velocities.  The goal is to develop a mechanistic understanding of
              boron nitride and silicon carbide syntheses under plasma conditions.     The
              approach to be taken in the experimental study is the injection of carbon,
              silicon and boron containing reactants into a low-density, supersonic, reactive
              plasma flow, and the interaction of this flow with a temperature controlled
              surface to deposit hard ceramic thin films.  Laser induced fluorescence and
              absorption spectroscopy will be used to study the gasdynamic flow and mixing
              behavior in the plasma.  Species fluxes will be monitored by molecular beam
              mass spectroscopy.  Deposited films will be characterized using x-ray
              photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and infrared and Raman
              spectroscopy.  The primary objective of the experimental study is to identify
              plasma flow conditions that favor the synthesis of c:BN or b-SiC over their
              hexagonal allotropes.  Another objective is to provide experimental
              measurements of: plasma flow properties (e.g.. temperature, velocity), atomic
              hydrogen concentrations, methyl radical concentrations, and reactive species
              fluxes.
