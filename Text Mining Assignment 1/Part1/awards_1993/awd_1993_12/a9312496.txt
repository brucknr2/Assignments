Abstract    :
              9312496  Eaton    Research on the interaction between fluid turbulence and
              particles  embedded in the flow will be carried out, based on experiments and 
              numerical modeling.  It is a continuation of prior work in which  turbulent
              channel flow was investigated.  Now, a sharp area  enlargement will induce
              separation.  Correlations between turbulence  structures and patterns of
              particle concentration will be obtained,  focusing on the separated region.   
              Flows with engineering relevance often contain regions of separation.   In two
              phase particulate laden flows, particle-turbulence interaction in  such regions
              is known to be important but essentially unexplored.  ***
