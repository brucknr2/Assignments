Abstract    :
              9312548  Kantor    This award provides funding for the first-year of a
              three-year  continuing award for the "Self-Sufficient Partnership for Research"
               Program at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst  Industry/University
              Cooperative Research Center on Polymers.  The  Center continues to meet the
              renewal criteria requirements of the  I/UCRC Program.    A three-year
              continuing award is also included for an evaluator to  study the
              university/industry interaction occurring in the Center.    Additional funding
              is provided for a minority undergraduate student  to augment the Center's
              research program with a study "Optical  Properties of Polymer Solutions."    
              The Department of Energy's Environmental Restoration and Waste  Management
              Office is providing funding to obtain a non-voting  membership in the Center.  
               Funding is also provided by the U.S. Army Natick RD&E Center and  the U.S.
              Army Research Laboratory to obtain memberships in the  Center.    The Program
              Manager recommends the University of Massachusetts,  Amherst be awarded: 
              $40,000 for the first year of a three-year  continuing award; $8,000 for the
              first year of a three-year  continuing award; $5,000 for one year with funds
              provided by the  Women, Minorities and Disabled Engineering Research Assistants
               Program; $10,000 for one year with funds provided by the U.S.  Department of
              Energy; $20,000 for one year with funds provided by  the U.S. Army Natick RD&E
              Center; and $20,000 for one year with  funds provided by the U.S. Army Research
              Laboratory.    Near the end of each 12-month period, the Program Manager and/or
               the Division Director of the Engineering Education Centers Division  will
              review the progress of the Center on a number of renewal  criteria, including
              the following:  1) the extent to which the  university/industry interaction is
              developing; 2) the extent to  which the support base is developing; and 3) the
              extent to which a  robust research program is developing.  If the review is 
              satisfactory, the Program Manager will re commend support for the  next period
              of this continuing award.
