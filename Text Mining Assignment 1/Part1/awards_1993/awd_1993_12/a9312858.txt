Abstract    :
                  9312858  Rosakis  This work studies the micromechanics of dynamic twin
              growth and the  evolution of phase boundaries in crystalline alloys of
              engineering  importance.  The study of twinning is a prerequisite to the 
              understanding of martensitic transformations and of the shape-  memory effect. 
                The general method of approach is base don the modern theory of  nonlinear
              elastodynamics of materials that change phase.  An  important ingredient will
              be the choice of a constitutive law,  namely a strain energy function which has
              many local minima  (potential wells) as a function of strain and exhibits and 
              appropriate type of anisotropy.  A class of dynamic problems  involving rapid
              propagation of twinned zones into untwinned  crystals will be formulated and
              analyzed.  ***
