Abstract    :
              9312143  Duncan  This proposal is to develop and evaluate methods to measure and
               limit disclosure risk in statistical and multilevel relational  databases.  It
              addresses the ability of database users to infer  sensitive information to
              which lack authorized access, based on  responses to authorized queries.  A
              decision-theoretic approach is  proposed to allow analysis as an optimization
              problem of maximizing  access to information subject to constraints on
              disclosure risk.   Building on previous work (e.g., Adam and Wortmann (1989),
              Denning  (1982), Duncan and Mukherjee (1991, 1992), Garvey, Lunt, and  Stickel
              (1991) and Mukherjee, Krishnan, and Duncan (1992), the  proposal is to
              accomplish the following tasks:  1.  develop hybrid  methods which combine
              existing disclosure limitation methods for  statistical databases, and specify
              appropriate measures to evaluate  their performance; 2.  provide a
              probabilistic framework to  evaluate disclosure limitation methods for
              statistical databases;  3.  introduce a methodology that could be used at the
              time of  schema design to detect and eliminate possible inference channels  in
              multilevel relational databases, particularly in the presence of  uncertainty
              about the external information used in the inference  process.
