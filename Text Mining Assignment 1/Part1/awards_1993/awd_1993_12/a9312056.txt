Abstract    :
              9312056  Bocarsly         This award is made in the Advanced Materials and
              Processing   Program in support of the research of Professor Andrew  
              Bocarsley. Support is provided by the Chemistry Division. The   general thrust
              of the research is the synthesis,   electrochemistry and rheological and
              morphological   characterization of cyanometallate coordination polymers. Three
                specific areas will be investigated: (1) Synthesis of   cyano-bridged
              polymers formed by electrochemical oxidation of a   ferrocyanide-Pt(IV)
              tetrammine. (2) Synthesis of coordination   polymers based on Pd(II)
              tetrachloride and either ferrocyanide   or ferricyanide. These polymers are
              hydrogels whose rheological   and morphological properties will be studied. (3)
              Layers of the   cyanide bridged Fe-Pt polymer, placed on a nickel electrode  
              will be photochemically patterned. This chemistry will lead to   transient
              optical gratings which will be employed to probe the   details of lateral and
              perpendicular charge-transfer from the   electrode surface through the polymer
              layer. Such systems may   provide for novel electro-optical switches.  %%% 
              Cyanometallate coordination polymers are relatively unexplored   materials
              whose redox, optical and rheological properties may    lead to a host of novel
              electronic, optical and structural   applications.   ***
