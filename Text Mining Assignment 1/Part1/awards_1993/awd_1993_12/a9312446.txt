Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Cretaceous basalts were recovered during a number of DSDP Legs form            
              the western Pacific.  The age of this crust is clearly anomalous               
              and how such voluminous crust formed is a difficult problem.  So               
              far, researchers have not dealt with these samples because of their            
              high degree of alteration and difficulty in analyzing such altered             
              samples for their isotopic ratios.  The PI will develop a new                  
              technique to analyze them and these analyses will minimize                     
              alteration effects on chemical composition.  The data to be                    
              gathered will be important in deciphering the origin(s) of this                
              Cretaceous crust.
