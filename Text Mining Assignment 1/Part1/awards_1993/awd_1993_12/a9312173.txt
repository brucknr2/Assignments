Abstract    :
              9312173  Hwu-Sadwick  An investigation of some of the most promising
              thermodynamically stable, chemically inert, elemental metal-phosphide binary
              compound heteroepitaxial candidates to indium phosphide (InP) is proposed. 
              Electrical and Optical characterizations at both room temperature and after
              elevated temperature annealing will be carried out and theoretical studies will
              be conducted to develop the understanding of the material and device properties
              of these new heteroepitaxial barriers to InP binary and ternary compound
              material.    Optical measurements such as photoluminenscence (PL),
              photoreflectance (PR), Raman, absorption and transmission and electrical
              measurements such as capacitance versus voltage (CV), current versus voltage
              (I-V), photoresponse, and resistivity measurements for the Schottky contacts
              and transmission line and resistivity measurements for the Ohmic contacts will
              be performed to determine the material and device characteristics of these new
              material systems.  The RE-P heteroepitaxial layers will also be grown on
              semi-insulating InP substrates so that Hall effect, magnetoresistance, and
              resistivity versus temperature measurements can be performed in an effort to
              ascertain whether the RE-P epilayers are metals, semimetals, semiconductors, or
              insulators.  Simulation models will be developed to perform energy band
              structure and bandgap calculations of these new material systems.  In addition,
              novel ternary compounds such as RExIn1-xP will be theoretically studied.  ***
