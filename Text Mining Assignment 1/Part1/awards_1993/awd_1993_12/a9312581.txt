Abstract    :
              ***  9312581  Yacout     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II
              project seeks to extend and refine a photon backscatter technique for detecting
              corrosion that is hidden from direct external observation. The technique
              involves scanning a collimated source photon beam (and its associated
              collimated detector) over limited ranges near an external surface, offering
              rapid nondestructive examination. Phase II will be concerned with demonstrating
              operation and optimizing design of laboratory prototype equipment to inspect
              systems that have both thin (< 4 mm) and thick (> 4 mm) external layers
              (covers) in both planar and cylindrical geometries. A simulation code developed
              during the Phase I study will be upgraded to incorporate polyenergetic source
              emission, both slab and general cylindrical geometries, photon detection over
              distributed energies (allowing spectral analysis of simulation results), and an
              expanded material library that will allow a variety of conditions to be
              simulated. The code will be used to identify promising design conditions for
              experimental investigation. Laboratory bench-top prototype equipment will be
              designed, constructed, and tested over a range of both design and sample
              variables. Design variables will be optimized for both thin- and thick-cover
              conditions.    The methodology has direct application to detection of hidden
              and inaccessible corrosion in various man-made systems including aircraft,
              ships, pipes, storage and processing tanks, buildings and bridges. Damage to
              such structures due to corrosion costs many millions of dollars per year and
              compromises safety.  ***
