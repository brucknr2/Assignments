Abstract    :
              9312641  Deviche    A symposium has been organized by Dr. Deviche as  part of
              the  annual meeting of the American Society of Zoologists. This  conference
              will focus on the endocrine mechanisms involved in the  physiological functions
              of artic birds and mammals. The  physiological functions include endocrine
              control of pre-  migratory fattening, hibernation and reproductive
              endocrinology.  The topic, "Endocrinology of Artic Birds and Mammals", is
              timely  and the speakers are considered experts in their respective  fields. It
              is anticipated that the symposium will be of interest  to comparative
              endocrinologists and physiologists as well as  behavioral ecologists.  ***
