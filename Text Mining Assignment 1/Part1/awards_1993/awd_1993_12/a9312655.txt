              Confluent/Diffluent Flow as a Mechanism for Tropical Cyclogenesis"           In
              earlier research, the principal investigator investigated the interactions of
              upper level potential vorticity disturbances and low level disturbances as a
              possible mechanism for tropical cyclones initiation.   While this mechanism
              appears to be important in the subtropics, it is not clear whether it applies
              to the deep tropics as well.             Under this award, Dr. Montgomery will
              simulate and diagnose the cyclogenetic potential of baroclinic wave packets in
              barotropic confluent/diffluent flow (basically corresponding to the flow in the
              boundaries between subtropical highs) in both dry and moist neutral
              atmospheres, using a three dimensional semi geostrophic model.  The study would
              attempt to mimic the passage of a tropical easterly wave into a region of
              confluence or diffluence.  In addition, he will other possible lifting
              mechanisms such as the beta effect and isolated vortices in shear flow. ***
