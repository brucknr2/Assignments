              their campus networks to SURAnet.  SURAnet is the midlevel  network located in
              the southeastern United States.  It will  provide operations management and
              information services and it  will give Covenant College a 56 thousand bits per
              second  connection to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per 
              second) National Backbone network.    The college has experienced a growth in
              auxiliary programs that  has added value to the basic mission that the college
              serves to  aid the education of all persons of all ages.  The networking  plan
              at Covenant College is the foundation for uniting all the  disciplines and
              campus groups.
