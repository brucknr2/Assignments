Abstract    :
              This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the work of              
              Professors Martin Saunders and R. James Cross at Yale University               
              in collaboration with Professor Robert J. Poreda at the                        
              University of Rochester to study the encapsulation of noble                    
              gases, small organic molecules (methane, carbon oxides), and                   
              metals (lithium) within fullerene. Enrichment of C60 with                      
              isotopically labeled 3He will be explored for tracer studies and               
              applications for synthetically modified fullerenes. They will                  
              also examine naturally occurring fullerenes for encapsulated                   
              atoms and molecules.

              In this project Professors Saunders and Cross in collaboration                 
              with Professor Poreda will seek to incorporate atoms and                       
              molecules in the fullerene C60 frame. They will improve their                  
              method for fullerene doping with larger quantities of                          
              isotopically labeled helium for synthetic purposes, for                        
              environmental tracer studies, and biomedical applications.
