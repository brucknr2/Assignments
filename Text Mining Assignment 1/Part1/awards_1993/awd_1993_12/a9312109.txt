Abstract    :
                   This award will provide funding to defray a portion of the                
              costs for a workshop on the future applications of improved                    
              measurements of absolute gravity. The recent development of a                  
              transportable instrument which can measure gravitational                       
              acceleration with a working accuracy of one microgal has opened up             
              the possibility of new capabilities in research areas such as                  
              global change (sea level changes), neotectonics, volcanism, and                
              geodynamics. This workshop, to be held in Boulder, Colorado on                 
              March 22-23 will bring together 20-40 active workers in these                  
              research areas from university and federal agency laboratories to              
              discuss the scientific implications of the new instrumentation and             
              the most efficient means to make such instrumentation available to             
              the U.S. geophysical research community.
