Abstract    :
              9312075     Selser    This work will use light scattering, principally the
              noninvasive  dynamic light scattering technique known as photon correlation 
              spectroscopy, to study slow relaxations in poly(ethylene oxide)  polymer
              electrolytes.  Poly(ethylene oxide) itself and  poly(ethylene oxide)-based
              polymer hosts are generally acknowledged  as among the best choices for polymer
              electrolytes both for  research and for application.  The purpose of this work
              will be to  determine, under the same conditions, the relationship between 
              conductivity in poly(ethylene oxide) electrolytes and slow  relaxations in
              poly(ethylene oxide) electrolytes, as probed by  light scattering.  ***
