Abstract    :
              9312982  Ohring  The interaction between metal films and diamond substrates will
              be investigated primarily by Rutherford backscattering (RBS) and transmission
              electron microscopy (TEM) methods.  The objective is to determine the nature of
              the interacial that lead to bonding between these materials.  This
              investigation is expected to:    1. yield quantitative kinetics of carbide
              growth.    2. yield values for the activation energy carbide formation.    3.
              identify reaction products and sequence of reaction.    4. provide
              high-resolution  structural details of the  metal/diamond, metal/carbide and
              carbide/diamond interfaces.    The proposed complementary chemical and
              structural studies will be conducted at both the Electronics Technology and
              Devices Laboratory (ETDL) of Fort Monmouth, NJ and Steven Institute of
              Technology.  ***
