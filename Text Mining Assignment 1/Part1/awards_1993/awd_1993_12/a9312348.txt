Abstract    :
              9312348  Schinazi        The conference proposed here will bring together a
              group of outstanding  biologist and mathematicians who are interested in
              applying Probability models  to Biology.  Recently there have been significant
              advances in understanding  the interplay between some interacting particle
              systems (Markovian spatial  stochastic models) and the class of differential
              equations traditionally used  to model ecological systems.  The stochastic
              models extend the traditional  deterministic biological models and open new
              issues for probabilists and  biologists alike.  Indeed a fresh perspective and
              foothold has been gained in  this well established area of mathematical
              modelling which promises to quite  fruitful.  On the one hand the broader view
              may be used to justify various  simulations done by biologist as well as give
              new ideas for simulations, while  on the other hand it raises several
              interesting probability questions about  new stochastic models.  Recent
              collaboration between researchers in  interacting particle systems and
              mathematical biology has shown that analyses  of stochastic biological models
              which have been done in the past can sometimes  be clarified using the modern
              probablilisitic viewpoint.  Seen from this new  light, the original stochastic
              models introduced by mathematical biologist and  ecologists acquire a unified
              meaning besides presenting a number of important  new biological insights. 
              This conference represents a unique opportunity to  advance mathematical
              biology, probability, ecology, and epidemiology in a  unified forum.  ***
