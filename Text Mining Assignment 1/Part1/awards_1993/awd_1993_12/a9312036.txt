Abstract    :
              9312036  Gould  The Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard University houses
              one of the world's premier collections of invertebrate fossils.  The
              collections is an important resource for scientists.  This project will provide
              compactors for storage of the specimens.  This will provide space for growth
              and more efficient curation of the collections.  It will also permit MCZ to
              become more active in acquisitions.
