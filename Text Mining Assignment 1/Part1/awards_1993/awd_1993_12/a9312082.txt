Abstract    :
                9312082  Espenson    This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation
              Program   will assist the Department of Chemistry at Iowa State    University
              in the purchase of a high resolution 400 MHz,   multinuclear, nuclear magnetic
              resonance (NMR) spectrometer.   This upgrade will enhance greatly research in a
              number of  areas   including the following:    1)  Organometallic chemistry of
              the transition metals,  2)  The development of new synthetic routes to
              alkaloids using   bridgehead radicals and carbanions,  3)  The exploration of
              novel synthetic routes to pleurotin and   podophyllotoxin using photochemical
              hydrogen atom   abstraction/cycloaddition,  4)  The coordination and
              organometallic chemistry of   metalloporphyrins,  5)  Structural and
              conformational characterization of novel   atranes,  6)  Non-covalent binding
              of substrates by synthetic receptors,  7)  A study of the fundamental thermal
              reactions of organic   compounds,  8)  An NMR study of free radical and
              electron transfer   processes.      %%%       A nuclear magnetic resonance
              (NMR) spectrometer is used to   obtain information about molecular structure
              (what types of   carbon and/or hydrogen atoms and/or hetero-atoms are present, 
               what are the relative number of each type of atoms and how are   they
              connected to one another in the molecule) and molecular   dynamics (how rapidly
              are the various parts of the molecule   moving).  This instrument is essential
              for any meaningful,   modern synthetic chemistry research program.  ***
