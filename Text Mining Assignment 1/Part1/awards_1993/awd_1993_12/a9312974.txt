Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is an international travel grant jointly supported by the                 
                                                                                             
              Polar Earth Sciences and Artic Programs and the Interfacial,                   
              Transport, and Separations Program.  The purpose of this                       
              international travel grant is to allow the traveler to                         
              interact with academics in the Peoples Republic of China.  The                 
                                                                                             
              activities include: (1) presentation of a paper at the Sixth                   
              International Conference on Permafrost in Beijing on July 5-                   
              9, 1993; (2) participation in a field excursion tot he Tibet-                  
              Qihai Plateau from July 10-24, 1993; and (3) a visit to two                    
              research institutes:  the Central Research Institute of                        
              Science and Technology of th Ministry of Chemical Industry;                    
              and, the Lanzhorn Institute of Glaciology and Geocryology.                     
              The common thread in these activities is the relation of                       
              interfacial and transport phenomena to behavior of soil in                     
              polar and other low temperature climates.  The traveler is an                  
              expert in predicting differential frost heave.  This phenomena                 
                                                                                             
              has engineering importance since its occurance can cause                       
              significant damage to raods, airport runways, pipelines, and                   
              buildings.
