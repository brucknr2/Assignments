Abstract    :
              9312428 Nadasen The nuclear physics research program of the University of
              Michigan Dearborn is carried out by the principal investigator and about four
              undergraduates students.  It focuses on studies of nuclear structure and
              nuclear reaction mechanisms in order to evaluate theoretical predictions and to
              provide a better understanding of nuclear phenomena in general.  Elastic
              scattering of Li 6 ions at 210 and 318 MeV on a range of targets has provided a
              global macroscopic description of the Li 6 nucleus interaction in terms of its
              energy and target mass dependence.  More fundamentally, the data were used to
              evaluate microscopic folding model calculations.  Extension of these studies to
              Li 7, Li 9 and Li 11 will illustrate the perturbation caused by the extra
              neutrons and the effect of using unstable beams.  Measurements of light ions
              emanating from nucleus nucleus collisions using the MSU 4pi Array have
              elucidated many features of heavy ion reactions.  The addition of Bragg curve
              detectors and parallel plate avalanche counters facilitate measurement of
              heavier fragments and thus broadened the studies of nuclear matter and dynamics
              of heavy ion reactions.  (p,pHe 4) reaction studies in the 100 200 MeV region
              and measurements of (He 4, 2He 4) at 580 MeV indicate that projectiles with
              energies above 100 MeV/Nucleon provide reliable information of alpha clustering
              in nuclei.  These studies will be continued in order to investigate alpha
              cluster structures of heavier nuclei with the hope of determining alpha decay
              rates of long lived nuclei.
