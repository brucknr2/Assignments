Abstract    :
              The Workshop on Approximation Algorithms will be held at Rutgers DIMACS        
              on March 24-26, to bring together researchers working on upper bounds          
              with researchers working on lower bounds.  DIMACS will provide some            
              support for the participants.  This proposal will support travel               
              expenses of some participants who could not otherwise attend, including        
              graduate students.
