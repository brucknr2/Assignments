Abstract    :
                9312736  Antolovich  This project is for the partial support of two sequential
              annual  workshops on research areas associated with processing,  constitutive
              laws, damage detection, damage and lifetime prediction  of advanced engineering
              materials and materials used in critical  applications.  The first workshop
              will be held September 13-16,  1993 at Washington State University, Pullman,
              Washington.  The  second will be held 12 to 18 months later at the Georgia
              Institute  of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia.  The goal of the workshops is to 
              assemble leading researchers in an interdisciplinary environment so  that the
              significance and implication of problems and advances in  a particular field
              can be shared broadly.  Emphasis will be placed  on reviewing progress that has
              been made in the areas of thrust of  the workshop, and on defining research
              that needs to be performed  in order to achieve major breakthroughs.   ***
