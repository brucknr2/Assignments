Abstract    :
              Abstract  ATM-9312667  Akasofu      The second International Conference on
              Substorms (ICS-2) is  proposed to be held in Fairbanks March 7-11, 1994,
              partially in  celebrating the 30-year anniversary of the birth of the
              discipline  and that ICS-3 be held in France in 1996.  It is one of the major 
              intents of ICS to bring in young researchers to the discipline of 
              magnetospheric substorms.  They, it was agreed that special efforts  be made to
              encourage graduate students to participate in it. The  study of magnetospheric
              stbstroms has now become well established  as one of the major disciplines in
              space plasma physics,  magnetospheric physics and solar-terrestrial physics. 
              It includes  practically a study of all fundamental processes in the 
              magnetosphere-ionosphere system similar processes may be found in  solar
              flares, the magnetized planets and even in comets.  The first  ICS (ICS-1) was
              held in Kiruna, Sweden, on March, 1992.  It was  attended by about 150
              researchers and was a great success as can be  judged from the excellent
              Proceedings produced promptly by the  organizers.  In order for every attendant
              to hear talks by the  others, there was no parallel session.  (The program was
              attached  in Appendix II).  ***
