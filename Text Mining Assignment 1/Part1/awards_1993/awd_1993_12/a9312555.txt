              9312555 Haug          This award provides funding for three years  under the
              "Self Sufficient Partnership for Research" Program to the University of Iowa's
              Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Simulation and Design for
              Mechanical System.          The Center meets the I/UCRC "Self Sufficient
              Partnership for Research" Program review criteria and continues to demonstrate
              excellent support from membership sponsors.          Additional funding is
              provided by the U.S. Department of Air Force at Robins Air Force Base to
              augment on going research and to obtain a membership in Center.           
              Funding is also provided by the Department of Energy's Environmental
              Restoration and Waste Management Office to obtain a non voting membership in
              the Center.          The Program Manager recommends the University of Iowa be
              awarded $120,000 for three years (36 months);  $40,000 for one year with funds
              provided by the U.S. Air Force; and $10,000 for one year with funds provided by
              the Department of Energy. ***
