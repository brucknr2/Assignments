Abstract    :
              9312180   Snell       Transylvania University requests support from NSF for 
              connection of its campus network to SURAnet.  SURAnet is the  midlevel network
              located in the southeastern United States.  It  will provide operations
              management and information services and  it will provide Transylvania
              University with a 56 thousand bits  per second connection to the NSFNET, a high
              speed (1.5 - 45  million bits per second) National Backbone network.       The
              University needs greater functionality and network speed  to be able to access
              supercomputers, libraries, and make file  transfers along with being able to
              implement a more reliable mail  system. Students and faculty research will
              benefit from the link.   This is also a unique opportunity for the school to
              explore  innovative educational resources.  ***
