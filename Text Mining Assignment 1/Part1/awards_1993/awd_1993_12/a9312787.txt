Abstract    :
                    ABSTRACT    P.I.Glenn Goodfriend   SBR-9312787    A number of new dating
              techniques for use in archaeology are currently in the development stages.  Of
              these, aspartic acid racemization on shell of various sorts (particluarly
              ostrich egg shell) is the most exciting and reliable, covering new ranges of
              dates that other techniques are inadequate for.      The current  small project
              will be the first application of this technique to especially recent
              excavations from Lake Titicaca around the time of colonization.  It will allow
              for a more detailed understanding of the dynamics surrounding a number of
              events, including environmental alteration/degradation, that happened around
              that time.  It will also allow refinement of the dating techniques themselves.
