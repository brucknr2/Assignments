Abstract    :
              9312698  Tsui       Robust Design is an important method for improving product
              or  manufacturing process design by making the output response  insensitive
              (robust) to hard-to-control variations (noise).  In  analyzing robust design
              experiments, Taguchi (1986) proposed a two-  step procedure to identify the
              "optimal" factor settings that  minimize the average quadratic loss.  His
              two-step procedure  becomes very effective in practice since it reduces the
              dimension  of the design optimization problem and it does not require re- 
              optimization for future changes of the target value.          This research
              will develop improved statistical methods for  analyzing robust design
              experiments.  The researchers develop a  multi-step analysis procedure for a
              variety of robust design  problems.  Their new procedure substantially reduces
              the dimension  of the design optimization problem and does not require 
              reoptimizaton for future changes of design requirements.  This  produces
              savings in the development time of product and  manufacturing process design
              and allows for flexible manufacturing.   The procedure also helps engineers
              better understand the physical  mechanism of the product and process and allows
              the designer to  make tradeoffs among the off-target bias and the individual
              process  variances contributed by different noise factors.       The research
              also identifies the appropriate robust design  objectives and establishes their
              relationships with the quality   loss functions for various robust design
              problems.  They will  strategies for implementing the multi-step procedure for
              smaller-  the-better and larger-the-better problems as well as for the 
              problems with several responses.
