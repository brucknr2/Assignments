Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This SGER deals with a fundamental problem in polymer science,                 
              namely how do giant molecules move with respect to each other?  A              
              widely held view, espoused by de Gennes and others, is that                    
              macromolecules move in a snakelike fashion, i.e., by reptation.                
              Reptation seems to hold under some conditions, but not under                   
              others.  In the absence of decisive experiments, the theory has,               
              therefore, become controversial.  This research aims to provide a              
              decive test.  It will consist of careful preparation of a series of            
              polymers with deuteration either at the ends or in the center of               
              the chains.  The diffusion of the molecules will then be studied               
              under a variety of conditions, using neutron reflectivity and other            
              means.                                                                         
                                                                                             
              This careful test of polymer dynamics is needed.  If successful,               
              the experiments will either be a decisive test of the theory or at             
              least point the way to other experiments that should settle this               
              issue.  In either case, rheology of polymers will be put on a more             
              scientific basis.
