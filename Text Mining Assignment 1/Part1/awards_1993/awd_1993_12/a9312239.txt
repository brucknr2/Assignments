Abstract    :
              9312239  Maccini  Inventory fluctuations are an important feature of business 
              cycles.  Yet inventory research is in a very unsettled state.   This research
              will focus on two important unsettled issues.  One  is whether cost shocks in
              the form of significant price increases  of important inputs in the production
              process together with the  need to hold buffer stocks can explain inventory and
              production  movements.  Existing work has concentrated on a small set of 
              manufacturing industries and solely on finished goods  inventories.  This 
              research focuses on examining production to  order as well as production to
              stock and investigates the  interaction of order backlogs and inventories. 
              Further, it will  examine the interaction of movements in inventories of
              materials  and supplies with those of finished goods.  The second issue to  be
              analyzed is how do credit market conditions influence  inventory movements. 
              This is critical for understanding how  monetary policy affects the economy. 
              The research focuses on  whether borrowing constraints brought about by
              imperfections in  the credit markets causes certain firms to have limited
              access to  credit which in turn influences their pattern of inventory  holding
              behavior.  A data base for individual firms which  combines data on financial
              condition with that on inventories and  sales will also be constructed and
              used.  ***
