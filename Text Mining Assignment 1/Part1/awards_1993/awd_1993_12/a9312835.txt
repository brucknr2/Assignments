Abstract    :
                   Linguistic theory and computation have both made substantial              
              progress over the past decade.  However, the connections between               
              the two have not been as carefully elucidated, so that the synergy             
              between linguistic science, which in effect describes data                     
              structures, and computer science, which describes the algorithms               
              engaging those data structures, has not been fully realized.                   
              Partly for this reason, current application systems by some                    
              estimates lag behind linguistic theory by 5-10 years.  This 2-day              
              workshop aims to bring together researchers in both linguistic                 
              science and computation to address this gap, with the aim of                   
              producing a book of collected consensus and divergent views on this            
              important topic.//
