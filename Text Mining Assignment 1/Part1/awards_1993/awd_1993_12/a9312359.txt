Abstract    :
              9312359  Randall       This award connects five higher education institutions to
               NSFNET through the CERFNet mid-level network.  Faculty and students  at the
              institutions will benefit from access to the resources of  the Internet,
              including libraries and supercomputers.  In addition,  they will be able to
              communicate and collaborate with colleagues at  other campuses in pursuit of
              research and educational projects. The  award provides partial support of the
              project for two years.  ***
