Abstract    :
              9312881  Montonye    This proposal, from SPIE -- The International Society for
              Optical--  Engineering, will provide support for SPIE's efforts in the Former
              Soviet  Union (FSU).  SPIE's activities will enhance FSU communications 
              potential with the establishment of a printing and distribution capability for 
              scientific journals and newsletters, and the installation of electronic mail 
              and a bulletin board capability in the chapter's Moscow headquarters.       
              The goal of this SPIE program is to promote scientific interchange  between
              U.S. scientists and their counterparts in the FSU, and to establish  and foster
              a capability for optics-related scientists and scientific groups  within the
              FSU to network and communicate, and to form and expand  alliances within a
              professional society framework for their common  benefit.        ***
