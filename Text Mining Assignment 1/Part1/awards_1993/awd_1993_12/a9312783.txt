Abstract    :
              9312783 Jordan This research is on the development of organizational networks
              and decentralized decision-making within networks.  The development of networks
              is to be modeled as an evolutionary process by which firms modify their
              internal information and decision networks in response to the perceived
              economic performance of other firms.  The second line of proposed research
              concerns the design of management accounting information systems for networks
              of productive activities.  A management accounting system reports to activity
              managers information, such as cost and revenue information, aggregated from the
              actions of other activities, and also measures the performance.  Different
              accounting systems can be compared according to their ability to ensure
              profitable budgets.  The proposed research would extend this model to include
              fixed-expenses and inventory budgeting and to include a more explicit treatment
              of the budgeting process.
