Abstract    :
              Greenberg  9312929  Spirochetes are a phylogenetically ancient group of
              bacteria.   These organisms have a unique overall cell surface structure and 
              mode of motility, but their special cellular properties have not  previously
              been studied extensively because of difficulties  encountered in growing cells
              under laboratory conditions.  However,  because of recent advances in our
              understanding of the molecular  and genetic properties of the cells brought
              about by modern  technological advances, an ongoing conference to bring 
              investigators together to exchange information is of major  importance.  This
              is the first Gordon Research Conference on the  biology of the spirochetes. 
              The conference is anticipated to have  110-135 attendees and will take place
              January 2-7, 1994 in Ventura,  California.  ***
