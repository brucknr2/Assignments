Abstract    :
              9312480  Lande  A detector for solar neutrinos will be constructed for siting in
               a deep underground laboratory relatively free from backgrounds  due to cosmic
              rays.  The detector will use 100 tons of iodine as  the active medium, from
              which elemental xenon will be recovered  following reactions between the solar
              neutrinos and iodine nucei.  Data from this detector will confront theories of
              stellar  processes as well as setting limits on the properties of  neutrinos
              which have been postulated to explain a deficit in the  solar neutrino flux.
