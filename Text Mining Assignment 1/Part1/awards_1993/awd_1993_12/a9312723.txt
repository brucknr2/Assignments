Abstract    :
              9312723  Dufty       Strongly coupled plasmas occur in a number of important 
              astrophysical and terrestrial systems.  The proposed research is  a theoretical
              and numerical study of dynamical processes in the  simplest case of a
              one-component, as seen through the probe of a  single impurity atom or ion. 
              The questions of interest are those  beyond the domain of linear response and
              include important  aspects of both radiative and transport phenomena.  Among
              the  phenomena to be studied are the emission, absorption and  redistribution
              of radiation by the impurity, nonlinear stopping  powers, and collision-time
              distributions.  Theoretical techniques  of non equilibrium statistical
              mechanics and stochastic processes  will be closely correlated with computer
              simulations that ensure  proper control of assumptions used in the theory.  ***
