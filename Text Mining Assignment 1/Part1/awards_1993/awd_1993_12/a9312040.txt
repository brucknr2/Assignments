Abstract    :
              This award supports an integrated stratigraphic, paleontologic,                
              structural, geochemical, and geochronological study of the                     
              Ellsworth Mountains.  The purpose of this work is to determine the             
              depositional and tectonic history of this region during late                   
              Proterozoic and Paleozoic time.  The Ellsworth-Whitmore Mountains              
              block is an important tectonic element within the collage of                   
              continental crustal blocks of West Antarctica.  This investigation             
              will be accomplished by careful geological mapping and sample                  
              collecting for purposes of microstructural kinematic analysis,                 
              trace and rare-earth geochemical analysis, and geochronological                
              work.  The project will use 40Ar/39Ar and U/Pb isotopic dating                 
              methods to define the absolute timing of events.  This work will               
              help to constrain tectonic models for an important region of West              
              Antarctica.  In particular, a proper understanding of this block is            
              key to evaluating hypotheses about the formation or breakup of                 
              supercontinents, such as Rodinia in the Neoproterozoic or Gondwana             
              in the Paleozoic.
