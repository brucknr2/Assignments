Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              When a person is faced with a cognitive task that takes effort,                
              neurons in a brain region called the anterior cingulate cortex are             
              activated.  At present we don't know whether neuronal activation in            
              this region is related to nonspecific effects of arousal, the                  
              increased effort involved in making a decision, or processes                   
              related to divided attention.  With this NSF small grant for                   
              exploratory research, Dr. Olson will study the responses of single             
              neurons in the anterior cingulate during the performance of tasks              
              that activate this region in the human.  The animals will be                   
              trained on three different tasks in order to distinguish between               
              increases in activity that are due to arousal, decision making, or             
              split attention.  This project represents the first attempt to                 
              study the activity of this area in behaving animals.  The results              
              should advance our understanding of the cognitive circuits                     
              underlying selective attention and decision making.  They will be              
              relevant for models of decision processes in humans, robotics and              
              artificial intelligence as well as neuroscience.***//
