Abstract    :
              9312236  Parker  This is an award to provide renewed support  for the operation
              of the National Academy of  Sciences, National Academy of Engineering, 
              National Research Council's Water Science  Technology Board.  This Board
              provides a  focal point for studies related to  environmental engineering
              aspects of water  management.  The Board's objective is to  improve the
              scientific and technological  basis for resolving important questions and 
              issues relating to  management of water  resources.  This award is jointly
              supported  by the Environmental Engineering segment of  the Environmental and
              Ocean Systems Program  in the Engineering Directorate and by the  Hydrologic
              Sciences Program in the  Directorate for Geosciences.    An important function
              of the Water Science  Technology Board is to conduct studies and to  sponsor
              workshops and conferences that can be  utilized for program planning purposes. 
              The  Board also functions as an appropriate means  for coordination of research
              plans with other  Federal agencies including FEMA, USGS, EPA,  DOE, and the
              U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
