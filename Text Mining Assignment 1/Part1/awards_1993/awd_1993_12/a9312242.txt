Abstract    :
              9312242  Loferski    Description:  this project supports the  participation of a
              U.S. delegation to the  Seventh Workshop on Physics of Semiconductors  Devices
              to be held in New Delhi, India from  December 14 through 18, 1993.  The
              chairman of  the workshop is Dr. Krishan Lal of the National  Physical
              Laboratory in New Delhi which is  organizing the workshop.  Professor S.C. Jain
               was the organizer and Chairman or co-chairman  of the previous six workshops. 
              The workshop  topics will include: Device physics of  heterostrucures and
              quantum devices; advanced  discrete devices, characterization of 
              semiconducting materials, unit processes and  devices including diagnostic
              tools; futuristic  devices such as nanometer scale devices,  molecular
              electronics, and photonics.    Scope:  The planned workshop is one of a series 
              that is held every two to three years which  have gained excellent reputation
              because of the  high quality of papers and presentations.  The  workshop is
              attracting a large number of  eminent scientists from the U.S. and from major 
              European countries, Japan, and Canada, in  addition to India's top scientists
              in the  field.  Previous workshop has resulted in well  prepared, published
              proceedings.  ***
