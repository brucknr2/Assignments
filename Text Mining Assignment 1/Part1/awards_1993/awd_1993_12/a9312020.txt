Abstract    :
              9312020  Caple  The focus of this research is the elaboration of a 
              stereoselective protocol for carbon glycoside synthesis.  Variations in the
              nature of carbon nucleophiles capable of  undergoing reaction with ESI
              intermediates derived from the  protected glucal, attempts to control
              stereochemistry, possible  utilization of a series of glycals and the synthesis
              of targets  related to bioactive target molecules will be carried out.  %%% 
              With this Research in Undergraduate Institutions renewal award,  the Synthetic
              Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr.  Ronald Caple of the
              Department of Chemistry at the University  of Minnesota, Duluth, which will
              done in close collaboration  with Dr. William A. Smit of the Zelinski Institute
              of Organic  Chemistry, Rusian Academy of Science, Moscow.  The focus of the 
              work is the development of methodology for the controlled  preparation of
              carbon glycosides.  The involvement of  undergraduates is a vital component of
              the project.
