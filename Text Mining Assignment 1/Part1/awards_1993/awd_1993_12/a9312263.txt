Abstract    :
              9312263  Grabbe         Numerical development and analysis of instabilities and 
              transport in active regions of the Earth's magnetotail will be  carried out.  A
              set of parallel processing codes will model the  transport driven by
              instabilities associated with ion beams and  currents, as well as strong drifts
              caused by steep gradients and  strong electrostatic fields around the plasma
              sheet - lobe  transition, under a range of magnetotail conditions.  A linear
              code  and a transport code will include kinetic parts to evaluate growth  and
              transport driven by ion beam instabilities and electron  currents, and a fluid
              part for growth and transport driven by  gradients and electrostatic fields
              present near the plasma sheet  boundary layer.  The plasma dispersion function
              used for the  kinetic part of the code will be generalized to a modified plasma
               dispersion function in which the model distribution functions for  beams,
              currents, and background plasma can be tailored for  realistic input
              conditions.  When the codes are developed they will  be used for predicting
              transport processes under a variety of  plasma conditions for models of regions
              near the plasma sheet  boundary layer in the Earth's magnetotail.  ***
