              attend the Dagstuhl seminar on deduction.  The seminar will                    
              bring together about 50 leading researchers from all over the                  
              world to discuss recent results and future research                            
              directions.  Participants will include researchers                             
              representing the German national program on deduction which                    
              has been formed recently.
