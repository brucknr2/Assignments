Abstract    :
              9312028  Bruce       Massachusetts Institute for Technology requests support
              from  NSF for connection of the New Hampshire Technical College System,  the
              Maine Medical Center, Rivier College, and Simon's Rock College  of Bard to the
              New England Academic Research Network (Nearnet)  which is the NSF mid-level
              network that serves the New England  area.  A primary goal of NEARnet is to
              facilitate collaborative  projects and sharing of resources between
              institution, including  those outside the state.       NEARnet will provide
              operations management and information  services and it will give the
              universities and colleges a  connection to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45
              million bits per  second) National Backbone network.       The each of the
              universities has written a description of its  organization and a statement of
              the benefits of Internet access  that it expects including:  greater
              functionality and network speed  to be able to access supercomputers,
              libraries, and make file  transfers along with being able to implement a more
              reliable mail  system.  Students and faculty research will benefit from the
              links.   This is also a unique opportunity for the schools to explore 
              innovative educational resources.  Their diversity will expose  NEARnet to a
              broader range of user requirements.  NEARnet will use  the information obtained
              by serving this diverse group for the  benefit of New England's academic and
              research community.  ***
