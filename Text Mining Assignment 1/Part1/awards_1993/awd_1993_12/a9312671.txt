Abstract    :
              This research is part of our continued effort to extend a  background
              calibration principle to common multi-step/pipelined  ADC's.  The basic idea is
              to replace a component trimming procedure  usually done in the factory by a
              hidden electronic real-time  calibration circuit running in background.  Unlike
              other  calibration techniques running in the foreground, this technique is 
              based on dithering and nonlinear interpolation.  The goal is to  improve the
              performance of inherently fast ADC's by maintaining  simple system
              architectures that perform a sophisticated trimming  operation in background. 
              The generic research on lower-power  design using a recycled residue amplifier
              and capacitive reference  divider will help develop a family of
              high-performance analog  digital interface circuits with low power and premium
              speeds not  readily available in monolithic forms.
