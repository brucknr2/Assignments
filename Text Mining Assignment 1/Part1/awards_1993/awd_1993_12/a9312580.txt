Abstract    :
                Distributed programs are complex and hard to reason about.  An  important
              source of difficulty in actual installed distribution  systems is  their
              open-ended nature; unlike modules described in  traditional programming 
              languages, over time distributed  components may be added or removed, and they 
              may change their  connectivity.  The goal of this project is to study how large
               systems can be divided into extensible modular components about  which one can
               reason separately.  Such a separation will  facilitate the development and 
              incremental modification of code.  The research is based on a model of Actors: 
              The model supports  data encapsulation, procedural abstraction, asynchronous 
              communication, reconfigurability, and dynamic creation.  A formal  algebra of 
              actor configurations will be developed and methods for  composing properties of
               open actor systems will be studied.  The  proposed research will provide a 
              foundation for the formal  verification of safety-critical distributed software
               systems.
