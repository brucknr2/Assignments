Abstract    :
              9312601  Stupp    Over the past sixty years polymer science has focused on
              synthesis  and physical properties of materials containing the classical 
              linear chain macromolecules.  In this research program we depart  from the
              concept of one-dimensional linear polymers and explore the  transformation of
              polymer molecules to two-dimensional objects  using bulk chemical reactions. 
              The two-dimensional polymers of  interest are shaped as sheets with thicknesses
              in the scale of  nanometers and variable surface areas one to three orders of 
              magnitude greater.  The basic approach is to synthesize self  ordering
              molecules that can form "reactive" liquid crystals,  organized internally
              according to the thermodynamic principles of  microphase separation.  Research
              in the program is organized as a  concerted effort in which the essential
              synthetic work is closely  coupled to both computer modeling and experiments on
              the physical  properties of these novel materials.  %%%  The scientific
              importance of the program includes learning about  molecular self assembly and
              the physical behavior of molecular  objects having specific shape.  In a
              technological context, two-  dimensional macromolecules could lead to materials
              that generate  spontaneously a molecularly defined surface or that undergo
              unusual  phase transitions as their constituent molecular objects change  shape
              reversibly.  These materials would open opportunities so far  unknown in areas
              such as adhesion, sensor and membrane  technologies, as well as the use of
              materials for the controlled  release of chemicals to the environment or the
              human body.  ***
