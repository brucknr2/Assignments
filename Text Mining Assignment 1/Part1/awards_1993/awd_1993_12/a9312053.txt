Abstract    :
              9312053  Holmes  University of Massachusetts - Amherst  Dr. Robert R. Holmes,
              Chemistry Department, University of Massachusetts, is supported by the
              Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program for  a US-Russia
              Cooperative Science Program with Dr. Rauza P. Arshinova, Kazan State Univ.,
              Russia, to determine features which determine the properties of cyclic four-
              and five-coordinate silicon and five- and six-coordinate phosphorus compounds.
              New tri- and tetra-coordinate cyclic phosphorus and silicon compounds will be
              prepared by the Russian group. These will be used as precursors for
              five-coordinated cyclic derivatives to be synthesized by the Russian and US
              groups. These complexes will by studied by NMR spectroscopy and x-ray
              diffraction to determine ring conformational changes and ligand exchange
              phenomena. Theoretical calculations will be employed to model these processes
              and to understand the energetics of nucleophilic displacement reactions at
              phosphorus and silicon.  Many reactions of phosphorus and silicon involve some
              reagent attacking a phosphorus or silicon compound to produce an intermediate
              containing all of the reacting species. This project will combine the expertise
              of a US and a Russian group to determine how these intermediates behave and
              what reaction pathways are open to them. The work will center particularly on
              reactions which are important in biochemical energy transfer processes.
