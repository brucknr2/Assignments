Abstract    :
              9312823  Geil    A major problem in the development of the potential of
              "rigid-rod"  thermotropic liquid crystal polymers is to current lack of 
              understanding of the effect of synthesis and procesing on a) the  configuration
              (mer sequence) of copolymers and b) the "crystal  structure" (conformation,
              mobility and packing) of both homo- and  copolymers in the as-used and
              as-processed states.  Using the  oxybenzoate-oxynaphthoate family of polyesters
              as generic liquid  crystal polymers, the solutions to the above problem are
              being  sought using, primarily, electron diffraction studies at room and 
              elevated temperature of single crystals synthesized in a manner  particularly
              suitable for the research, complemented by x-ray  diffraction, electron
              microscopy, infrared spectroscopy and thermal  analysis.  The observations, it
              is believed, are also of relevance  to the problem of understanding the
              crystallization of polymers  that are not liquid crystalline in nature.  ***
