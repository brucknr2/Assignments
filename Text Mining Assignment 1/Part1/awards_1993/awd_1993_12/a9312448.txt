Abstract    :
              Professor Konkowski plans to continue her mathematical study  of mild
              singularities and Cauchy horizons in spacetime  models.  Mild singularities
              include quasiregular and  nonscalar curvature singularities.  In the former,
              particle  paths may end with no accompanying physical catastrophes,  while in
              the latter, some particles moving near the  singularity will feel infinite
              tidal forces, but not all do.  In most cases the spacetime models examined
              satisfy  Einstein's equations.    It is important to study relativistic
              spacetimes with mild  singularities, together with the behavior of particles
              and  fields in these spacetimes, in order to better understand  the nature of
              mild singularities.  The nature of  singularities which occur in the classical
              solutions of  Einstein's equations is largely an unexplored area.  The 
              singularity theorems which predict the occurrence of  singularities in broad
              classes of spacetimes give little  clue to their nature.  In order to better
              understand them,  it is important not only to study their mathematical 
              structure but to study the behavior of physical processes in  singular
              spacetimes.  Such a study will lead to a fuller  understanding of the relevance
              of spacetimes with different  types of singularities both within the
              mathematical  structure of Einstein's equation and within the physical 
              universe.
