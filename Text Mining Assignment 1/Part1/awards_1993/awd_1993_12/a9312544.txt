Abstract    :
              9312544  Golding  The aim of this experimental and theoretical research project
              is to  achieve a detailed, microscopic description of the motion and 
              energetics of defects that hop or tunnel between two closely spaced  sites in
              metals.  Interest in defect dynamics has assumed  significance recently for
              fundamental as well as technological  reasons.  Experimental tools, such as
              lithographic techniques, are  being developed to allow the study of a moving
              ion and its  interactions with conduction electrons and lattice vibrations.  
              Understanding the basic mechanism underlying these fluctuations is  crucial for
              assessing the stability and reliability of material for  submicron structures
              and devices.  The project theorist co-  principal investigator is at AT&T Bell
              Laboratories.  %%%  ***
