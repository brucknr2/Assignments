Abstract    :
              9312160  Peacock-Lopez  Dr. Enrique Peacock-Lopez is supported by a grant from
              the  Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to continue his  research
              in the theoretical treatment of biochemical reactions  in solution and on
              surfaces.  He has recently developed  theoretical methods for studying rapid
              biomolecular processes  on spherical surfaces,and has developed methodologies
              to  analyze open systems far from equilibrium.  Using these  methods, he plans
              to study chemical and biochemical processes  occurring on spherical surfaces
              such as those which occur in  the the early steps of internalization of large
              macromolecules  across the cell membrane via interaction with surface proteins.
               %%%  After binding to a receptor at the surface of the cell, many  proteins
              such as hormones trigger a cascade of chemical  reactions which amplify this
              surface recognition signal and  perform important biological functions within
              the cell.  This  cascade of events can be very complex, involving feedback and 
              activation loops.  Enrique-Lopez is interested in expanding  upon an original
              minimal model of the activation pathway which  he will use in conjunction with
              experimental results to  elucidate a molecular level explanation of these
              amplification  processes.  ***
