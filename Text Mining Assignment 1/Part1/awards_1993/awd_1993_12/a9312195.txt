Abstract    :
              9312195  Ruden  Future electronics technology will rely on electronics devices
              whose principles of operation are very different from those of current devices.
               As the critical dimensions shrink into the so-called mesoscopic range,
              phenomena such as quantum coherence and tunneling will dominate the
              characteristics of  structures which may contain only few electrons.  It is the
              underlying vision of this proposal that the transfer of electrons between
              nanostructures and the coupling of the electrons within these structures via
              Coulomb interactions are of crucial importance for possible future
              applications, e.g. high speed random access memory.  One coupling mechanism of
              the electrons within closely spaced nanostructures, and specifically quantum
              wires, is due to wavefunction overlap, i.e. tunneling.  A second coupling
              mechanism involving the Coulomb interaction between the electrons and the
              associated exchange interaction.   Our primary goals are   -to demonstrate and
              anayze new phenomena that occur when two  quantum wires are placed in close
              proximity so that there is  strong coupling.   -to explore new concepts for
              computation or data storage  based on instabilities in coupled quantum wires
              that were  recently predicted independently by Wu and Ruden and by  Gold.  The
              reseach proposed includes work on the theory of quantum structures, on
              materials growth, nanoscale device fabrication, and extensive characterization.
               In particular, we will explore experimentally and theoretically the electronic
              structure and transport properties of quantum wires in III-V semiconductor
              heterostructures.  ***
