Abstract    :
              This is a travel award for exploratory visits to the University                
              of Washington, Seattle, and the University of California,                      
              Berkeley.  Both visits will provide opportunities to meet faculty              
              and examine facilities at the institutions.  The purpose of the                
              visits is to facilitate discussion of potential postdoctoral                   
              training, and tentative planning of scientific research to be                  
              pursued.  Both Drs. Gelb (Seattle) and Klinman (Berkeley) have                 
              expressed interest in having Mr. Francisco visit their                         
              laboratories for this purpose, and in ultimately serving as his                
              mentor.
