Abstract    :
              9312611  Fox         This project will enhance the computer science
              undergraduate  learning experience by integrating courses with usable and
              useful  computerized materials comprising a comprehensive Digital Library. 
              Work at Virginia Tech and at Norfolk State University, an  historically black
              university, will demonstrate the cost  effectiveness of using Digital Libraries
              as the integrating concept  for improving learning through interaction with
              rich research  resources. By applying information retrieval, hypertext, 
              multimedia, and human-computer interaction methods, value will be  added to the
              Digital Library. Parts of a number of courses will be  enhanced through
              interactive use of algorithm animations, video,  images and text. There will be
              two new courses, "Human-Computer  Interaction" and a one credit University
              service course "Using  Computers and Networked Information". The existing
              course on  Computer Professionalism will make extensive use of the Digital 
              Library as an information resource. The Database Management course  will be
              revised to give students hands-on experience with  manipulating the Library
              itself. In addition, changes will be made  to courses in Data Structures,
              Algorithm Analysis, Introduction to  Computer Science, Formal Languages and
              Automata Theory, Parallel  and Distributed Computation, Numerical Analysis, and
              Software  Engineering to take advantage of this new resource. The project 
              includes plans to work with ACM to provide access to the enhanced  Digital
              Library to other computer science departments throughout  the nation.  ***
