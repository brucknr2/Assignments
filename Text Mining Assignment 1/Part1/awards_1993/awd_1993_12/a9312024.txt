Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  CTS-9312024  Chung     The proposed research focuses on the
              development of an optimum radiative four-fin system fin array which requires a
              minimum fin mass for a given amount of heat rejection while occupying a minimum
              space in the horizontal direction.  Because the minimum fin mass requirement
              typically results in a fairly long horizontal fin height, these two objectives
              are in conflict.  To resolve this apparent conflict, fuzzy set theory will be
              utilized to meet these two requirements simultaneously.  Each of the fuzzy
              objective functions will be used to define its own optimum solution, and then
              using constraints, which have been quantitatively described mathematically the
              entire system will be optimized.  Situations where both equal and unequal
              preference on the two objective functions are used will be investigated.  The
              numerical results will be compared with those of conventionally designed
              two-fin systems to determine the success of the optimization technique.
