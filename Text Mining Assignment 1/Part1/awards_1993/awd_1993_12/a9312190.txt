Abstract    :
              9312190  Bernstein  In this project of the Physical Chemistry Program in the 
              Chemistry Division, Prof. E. Bernstein of the Colorado State  University will
              study cold, isolated and solvated aromatic  carbene molecules created by laser
              photolysis and supersonic  jet cooling using several methods of laser
              spectroscopy.  These  include fluorescence excitation and dispersed emission 
              spectroscopies on the nanosecond time scale; mass resolved  excitation
              spectroscopy; picosecond correlated single photon  counting; and various
              picosecond time-resolved pump/probe  spectroscopies.  Similar work will also be
              done on clusters.  Complementary ab initio and semi-empirical calculations will
              be  used to assist in the interpretation of the experimental data.  %%% 
              Carbenes are radicals known to be important intermediates in  many
              condensed-phase chemical reactions.  To understand, and  ultimately be able to
              control such reactions, it is necessary to  know the properties of the
              participating carbene species.  Direct determination of some of their critical
              properties from  studies of the condensed phase is impractical and they are 
              therefore determined for the most part indirectly from kinetic  measurements. 
              This research serves to provide these properties  directly from measurements on
              gas phase carbene systems. The  compounds to be investigated should provide
              information on the  relationships between their geometrical structure,
              electronic  structure, and reactivity.  ***
