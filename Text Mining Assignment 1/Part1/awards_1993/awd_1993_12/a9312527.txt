Abstract    :
              9312527   Belford      International Travel Group Grant:  International Congress
              of   Membranes 1993, Heidelberg, Germany (September 30 - October 3,    1993). 
              This meeting represents a major opportunity for US.   academics conducting
              research in synthetic membranes to : (1)   present their latest research and
              development work to a large   and diverse international forum; (2) discuss
              their research   with the best researchers from Europe, Japan, and other  
              countries active in membrane development such as Russia,   Korea, Australia,
              China, and South Africa; (3) learn about   European membrane technology
              including the latest equipment   (modular designs, membrane performance, etc.)
              all the   Equipment Fair associated with the International Congress of  
              Membranes.  The travel grant will provide for partial airfare   on US airlines
              between the US and Germany.  The organizers   will provide NSF with a report on
              significant new development   presented at the meeting.   ***
