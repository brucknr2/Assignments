Abstract    :
              9312908  Trivedi       The American computer industry is affected by a lack of 
              synergism between the different phases of software design such as 
              specification, manufacturability, performance, reliability, and  cost
              assessment.  An Industry/University Cooperative Research  Center on Computer
              Engineering System Research at Duke University  could provide a better
              mechanism to advance the development and  application of basic research in the
              area of high performance,  dependable hardware, and software system for
              applications such as  real-time system, local and wide area networks,
              manufacturing  systems, flight-control systems, and command and control
              systems.       A planning meeting will study if industry will support an 
              Industry/University Cooperative Research Center on Computer  Engineering System
              Research at Duke University.  The meeting will  address industry interest and
              determine if the Center has  sufficient support and merit to meet the
              Industry/University  Cooperative Research Centers Program criteria.  The
              proposed  research projects will address:  1) Formal methods in system 
              engineering; 2) design principle of dependable and high performance 
              distributed systems and networks; 3) use of artificial neural  networks to
              solve complex design and scheduling problems; and 4)  statistical methodologies
              in software quality, reliability, and  safety.       The Principle Investigator
              is recognized as an eminent  researcher and has the resource for this planning
              meeting.       This project has been coordinated and cost-shared with Dr. 
              Bruce Barnes, Deputy Director of the Division of Computer and  Computation
              Research at the National Science Foundation.       The Program Manager
              recommends Duke University be awarded  $50,000 for 6 months for this planning
              meeting.  ***
