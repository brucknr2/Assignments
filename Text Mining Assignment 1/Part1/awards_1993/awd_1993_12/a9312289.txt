Abstract    :
              The Antarctic pack ice seals are represented by four species,                  
              Crabeater, Lobodon carcinophagus; Weddell, Leptonychotes                       
              weddellii; Leopard, Hydruga leptonyx; and Ross, Omatophoca                     
              rossii.  These species could be potentially affected by human                  
              related environmental impacts that are beginning to occur within               
              the Antarctic ecosystem.  The impact that such disturbances as                 
              global warming, ozone depletion, and commercial fisheries, could               
              have on the ecology and population dynamics of these species is                
              unknown.  Because of their dependence upon the pack ice                        
              ecosystem, it has been hypothesized that this group could be                   
              particularly vulnerable to slight changes that would be caused by              
              such events.  Census data, from very limited surveys, in the                   
              early 1980's, have shown that the crabeater seal population may                
              have declined in certain areas of the Antarctic in recent                      
              decades.  This species is currently being viewed as an indicator               
              of fisheries impact.  However, very little is known about the                  
              total distribution, abundance and general ecology of this species              
              around the Antarctic continent.  Thus, it is difficult to                      
              properly interpret local changes that may be observed from                     
              investigations.  This workshop will produce an integrated study                
              document that will prioritize topics of research on these marine               
              mammals.  The workshop will  encourage cooperation and sharing of              
              data, logistic resources, and scientific expertise.
