Abstract    :
              9312596  Chakrabarti  This proposal involves the analysis, by simulation
              methods, of  phase transitions within random porous media. In particular, the 
              phase separation of binary liquid mixtures and the isotropic to  nematic liquid
              crystal phase transition will be studied. Comparison  will be made to
              experimental results and to simple theoretical  models. The porous medium will
              be modelled so that it has an  interconnected and tortuous structure resembling
              Vycor glass (a  common experimental medium). The 3D simulation methods to be
              used  are a) Monte Carlo to study the equilibrium conditions and b)  Numerical
              solution of the time dependent field equations to study  the kinetics of the
              ordering processes. These are lattice models  and their solutions will be
              implemented on the parallel  architecture of the Connection Machine.  %%% 
              Porous media have a profound effect upon the phase transitions of  systems
              contained within them. In this proposal, the phase  separation of two component
              liquids and the isotropic (molecular  axes randomly oriented) to nematic
              (melecular axes aligned)  transition of liquid crystals will be studied by
              computer  simulation. Although significant experimental and pure-theory work 
              have been performed here, little simulational work has been done.  The present
              proposal seeks to ask (and answer) specific questions  which neither experiment
              nor theory can hope to answer alone. The  work will involve the numerical
              solution of model liquids and  liquid crystals trapped within a model porous
              medium designed to  represent the tortous and interconnected structure of Vycor
              glass-  the principal experimental medium. The simulations will be  performed
              on a parallel architecture computer. This work has  significant relevance to
              our undertsanding of processes occuring  within rocks or within catalysts.  ***
