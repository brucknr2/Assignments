Abstract    :
              The emphasis of this exploratory project is to conduct an                      
              experimental study of the partitioning of boron between                        
              muscovite and aqueous fluids.  The experiments will involve                    
              the use of  double-capsule techniques, with the run products                   
              being analyzed by  isotope dilution.  Run conditions for the                   
              study are 600, 800, and 1000oC at 2 GPa and at 800oC at 1,2                    
              and 3 GPa.   The techniques developed in this research and                     
              the partitioning results will ultimately find application in                   
              research related to the use of boron and its isotopes as                       
              geochemical tracers in subduction zone processes.
