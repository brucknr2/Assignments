Abstract    :
                    9312207  Arruda  The work represents planning activities required for the 
              verification of a spectroscopic polymer characterization technique  as a
              sufficient apparatus for the in-situ characterization of  orientation
              parameters from a deforming polymeric network, suitable  for implementation
              into internal variable based polymer  constitutive models.  An apparatus for
              measuring the polarized  fluorescence of elastomers during large strain
              deformations will be  adapted for the real-time characterization of various
              deformation  states.  The information obtained from model elastomeric networks 
              will be implemented directly into a constitutive model as internal  variables
              monitoring orientation state.  ***
