Abstract    :
              9312139  Weeks  This research planning grant will allow the investigator to 
              refine the theory and methods with which to examine the effect  political and
              economic inequalities in the world system have on  the construction of a shared
              understanding of environmental  problems.  The study itself will use
              ethnographic interviews,  analysis of written materials, and basic
              organizational analysis  to make two sets of comparisons:  between World
              Wildlife Fund  India and World Wildlife Fund U.S.; and World Wildlife Fund
              India  and Bhopal Gas Affected Working Women's Union.  The first pairing 
              allows comparison of the nature of transnationally shared  analytical and
              normative socio-scientific systems; the second,  study of the nature of
              national affiliation on construction of  environmentalism to determine whether
              there are analytic  categories unique to Indian environmentalism.  The goals of
              this  fifteen month planning grant are:  1) develop the interview  schedule; 2)
              refine the theoretical framework; 3) refine methods  to analyze textual and
              interview materials; and 4) to write a  full research proposal.  Planning
              activities included in this  request are:  the collection of background
              materials on  organizations to be studied; travel to India to work with the 
              Indian collaborator to plan field work in India; identifying  potential
              interviewees; consulation with a political scientist  and a linguist to refine
              the theoretical framework and  methodology.  The reserach should provide new
              insights on the  conditions under which a cross-culturally shared understanding
              of  environmentalism arises, and alternately, the conditions under  which it is
              thwarted.  ***
