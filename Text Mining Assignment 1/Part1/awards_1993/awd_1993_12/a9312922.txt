Abstract    :
              9312922  Mayne       The research addresses the problem of obtaining nonlinear 
              controllers for the control of linear and nonlinear systems  subject to control
              and state constraints.  There will be two  prongs to this research, both
              employing optimization.  The first  will be concerned with online optimization
              and will build on our  existing results on receding horizon (model predictive)
              control  in which we have overcome many of the obstacles impeding its use  for
              the control of nonlinear systems; our research will endeavor  to remove the
              remaining restrictions,. to improve the observer-  based controller, and to
              develop an adaptive version of the  receding horizon controller.  The second
              prong will be directed  to the development of novel, nonlinear controllers,
              designed  using, extensive off-line optimization, for controlling  constrained
              dynamic systems, both linear and nonlinear.  This  research constitutes a new
              approach to an important, but  difficult area, and it motivated by the results
              we have obtained  in receding horizon control.  A beneficial side effect of
              success  in this area would be the provision of initial feasible controls 
              (i.e., controls which satisfy the control and state constraints)  for receding
              horizon control, thus mitigating one of the most  difficult problems arising
              when this type of control is employed  to control constrained nonlinear
              systems.  ****
