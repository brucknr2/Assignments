Abstract    :
              9312048  Starnes    This research will be directed toward the elucidation of the
               detailed structures and polymerization mechanisms of poly(vinyl  acetate),
              various vinylidene chloride polymers, and poly(vinyl  chloride).  All of these
              polymers have great technological  significance, and all of them are made
              commercially by free-radical  polymerization.  Much of the effort will relate
              to the  identification and quantification of structural defects in the 
              polymers such as long and short branches, long-chain ends,  adventitious
              unsaturation, adventitious structures containing  oxygen, and groups derived
              from solvents.  The principal analytical  tool will be high-field Nuclear
              Magnetic Resonance, and both the  poly(vinyl chloride) and the  vinylidence
              chloride polymers will  first be converted chemically into the corresponding 
              "polyethylenes" in order to facilitate the analyses.  Resonance  assignments
              will be confirmed by comparing the polymer spectra with  those of reference
              models that are to be synthesized during the  course of the project.  In the
              case of poly(vinyl acetate), a major  goal will be to understand fully the
              striking effects of aromatic  solvents on the polymerization chemistry and
              kinetics.  The work  with poly(vinyl chloride) and the polymers of vinylidene
              chloride  will be concerned especially with the structural defects that 
              contribute to the thermal instability of these materials.  Results  obtained
              from the project should suggest ways of modifying the  polymerization processes
              in order to form polymers with improved  properties.  ***
