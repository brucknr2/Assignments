Abstract    :
              9312647  Mileti  The project will bring together existing natural hazards 
              knowledge from all relevant fields.  It will examine what is  the level of the
              available knowledge, how all the pertinent  disciplinary research is being
              integrated, and what should  be the future research agenda with the purpose of
              maximizing  natural hazards mitigation for sustainable growth and  development.
               A full range of experts and students will  assemble and codify existing
              information, analyze it and  make research recommendations.  The examination of
              issues  such as risk management and the increased globalization,  complexity
              and interdependence of environmental, physical  and socio-economic systems will
              be part of the project.  The  results of the work will influence the nation's
              hazards  research agenda, change research priorities and encourage  the
              creation of a new generation of natural hazards experts.  ***
