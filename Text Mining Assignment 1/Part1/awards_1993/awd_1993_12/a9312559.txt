Abstract    :
              This research is concerned with development, analysis and  evaluation of
              algorithms for signal/image processing in addition  to, or in lieu of, the
              usual second order statistics.  Both time  series (only system output is
              observed) and system identification  (both input and output are observed)
              formulations are being  considered; and both one-dimensional and
              multidimensional signals  and systems are being investigated.  Whereas the
              second order  statistics of signals are a function of only the underlying
              system  transfer function magnitude, higher order Statistics (HOS) of the  data
              carry useful information about the phase characteristics of  the underlying
              signal/system which is crucial in deconvolution  problems such as those arising
              in digital communication channel  equalization, seismic wavelet processing, and
              image restoration,  analysis and synthesis.    Time domain as well as frequency
              domain methods using higher order  cumulant functions and higher order cumulant
              spectra (or higher  order integrated cumulant spectra), respectively, are being
               pursued.  Among the applications being investigated are: (i) image  texture
              synthesis and classification, (ii) differential time-delay  and doppler
              estimation in unknown spatially correlated Gaussian  noise, (iii) blind
              deconvolution with unknown, possibly nonminimum  phase, channels including
              image restoration, and (iv) system  identification with noise inputs.
