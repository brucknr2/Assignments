Abstract    :
              9312134 Khargonekar This proposal is part of a major effort by systems/control
              and solid state electronics specialists to advance the application of control
              and systems theory to real time feedback control of semiconductor manufacturing
              equipment.  We have chosen Reactive Ion Etching (RIE) as our initial research
              vehicle.  This proposal describes fundamental research necessary for the
              application of real time control systems theory and technology to RIE.  Our
              overall goal is to redesign the RIE machine for enhanced controllability and
              improved performance.  We believe that this research program has the potential
              of offering dramatic improvement in the performance characteristics of RIE as
              measured by attainable feature size, uniformity of wafer processing, and yield.
