Abstract    :
              Lin  Abstract    The goal of this effort is to develop an environmentally and
              economically sound single-step phosphate/paint system.  Relationships between
              performance and chemical formulation are examined for systems that incorporate
              the phosphatizing compounds into the coating formulation.  Issues addressed in
              this study include system stability as related to resin/crosslinker
              polymerization and pigment dispersion; mechanisms and behavior of thermal
              curing and the influence of the diffusivity of the phosphatizing agents and
              their reaction with the metal surface; molecular level behavior of the
              phosphate as related to polymer adhesion and corrosion inhibition; optimal
              formulation ranges for components of paints; and verification of protection
              performance.  Optical, analytical, surface-characterization, and
              electrochemical techniques are used to examine system stability and
              compatibility, the composition, structures, adhesion, and nature of bonding at
              the coating interface, and the corrosion-inhibition and barrier effects of the
              finished coatings.  A consortium of industrial collaborators including Finishes
              Unlimited, Cargill, Pre-Finish Metals, and G.J. Nikolas & Co. has been formed
              to perform the testing and verification of coatings developed at Northern
              Illinois.    The combination of the phosphate, primer, and topcoat into a
              single-step process offers significant reductions in time, energy, materials,
              and labor.  More  importantly, the unicoat phosphate/paint system reduces
              environmental contamination by elimination of primer and pretreatment steps,
              eliminating wastes containing hexavalent chromium, and drastically  reducing
              volatile organic compounds (VOCs) lost in curing and drying.      m <   ÕLL
