Abstract    :
                   This grant supports a workshop on numerical modeling of mantle            
              convection, to be held at Los Alamos National Laboratory.  This                
              workshop is part of the Cooperative Studies of the Earth's Deep                
              Interior (CSEDI), and is designed to lay the groundwork for                    
              developing the infrastructure necessary to advance numerical                   
              modeling of mangle convection.  15 scientists will participate in              
              developing a statement of purpose that will form the basis for a               
              long term effort to develop the tools necessary for further                    
              advancement in modeling mantle dynamics.
