Abstract    :
              This grant in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program is                  
              the logical extension of Dr. Pirkle's long-standing program in                 
              the development of CSPs, chiral stationary phases, often known                 
              as "Pirkle Phases."  The PI proposes to develop new CSPs for                   
              the analytical and preparative scale separation of                             
              beta-blocker-like and nonsteroidal, antiinflammatory chiral                    
              organic compounds.  A new type of CSP, called "multi-tined" is                 
              proposed that will have controlled spacing between the                         
              selectors on the backbone of a chemically bonded stationary                    
              phase.  Preparative-scale separation schemes are also proposed                 
              based on nonchromatographic, batch processes and hollow-fiber                  
              membrane separation techniques.  The proposed research is                      
              vitally important to the pharmaceutical industry which is                      
              always searching for new, more economical methods for the                      
              separation of enantiomeric materials.                                          
              %%%                                                                            
              Professor Pirkle and his students will develop and prepare new                 
              chromatographic stationary phases for the separation of chiral                 
              materials especially moities of interest to the pharmaceutical                 
              industry.
