Abstract    :
                  9312707  Voyiadjis  This research is to develop an accurate constitutive
              model for  the remolded soil slurry at the front of the cutter head of a 
              tunnel boring machine.  The material in this highly deformed  region will be
              considered as a Cosserat continuum, and the  results implemented into a finite
              element type computer code.   The experimental and numerical results obtained
              in this work will  assist in the development of underground space.  ***
