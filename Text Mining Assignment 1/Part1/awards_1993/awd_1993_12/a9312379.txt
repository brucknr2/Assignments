Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT -- CTS-9312379  Bayazitoglu     The proposed research is directed at
              developing a solution to the problem of heat transfer in liquid metals placed
              in an alternating magnetic field.  A method of relocating the sample within the
              field using non-contact methods will be developed, along with a method for
              determining the forces exerted by an arbitrary magnetic field on a conducting
              body.  In this way, the problem of heat transfer from the molten sample along
              with its dynamic interaction can be addressed.  Upon completion of the modeling
              portion, a laboratory prototype of the relocation module will be constructed
              and evaluated.  The results from this evaluation process will then be compared
              with the analytical model to verify it and determine its viability.
