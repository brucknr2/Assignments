Abstract    :
              9312013  Calvert  Auroral electron precipitation is hypothesized to result from 
              electron pitch-angle scattering by the cyclotron maser instability  during the
              generation of auroral kilometric radiation (AKR).  The  AKR consists of
              intense, primarily extraordinary-mode waves  originating on auroral magnetic
              field lines at geocentric altitudes   of 1.3 to 3.3 earth radii.  Comprising up
              to one percent of the  total power of the aurora the AKR is now widely believed
              to be  generated by the cyclotron maser instability which results from the 
              doppler-shifted, cyclotron-resonant, pitch-angle scattering of  energetic
              electrons into the loss cone.  Critical to this new  theory of the aurora is
              explaining the observed triggering of the  AKR by radio waves from the sun,
              since that phenomenon clearly  confirms the new theory.  The proposed work is
              to study this  triggering, believed to be caused by enhanced local
              precipitation  in ambient density minima and the consequent creation of density
               depletions in which radio lasing can occur.  Such radio lasing  consists of
              closed-loop wave feedback oscillations caused by wave  reflections at the
              source, exactly analogous to those of  conventional optical lasers and likewise
              producing nearly-perfect  discrete, coherent, and monochromatic emissions.  ***
