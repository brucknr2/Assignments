Abstract    :
              9312916  Coleman    This research is concerned with the study of formation, 
              characterization, optical properties and theoretical models of a  new wide-gap
              semiconductor intercalation compound.  This involves  new host systems of layer
              structure heavy metal iodides.   Preliminary data indicate unique large
              unexpected shifts of the  optical band edges and the lack of charge transfer
              upon  intercalation of lead iodide and bismuth iodide with hydrazine and 
              methylhydrazines.  A large increase in optical absorption above the  band edge
              and a decrease in absorption below the band edge for the  intercalated material
              produce sharp optical band edges which would  have potential uses in modulation
              spectroscopic optical switching  devices.  Because this new intercalation
              system does not appear to  follow the usual rigid band model, the proposed work
              intends to  distinguish among the possible bonding models for the process which
               include polarization, hydrogen bonding, charge transfer, and  donor/acceptor
              bonding.  Determining the controlling factors in the  bonding mechanism will
              allow optimization and tailoring of this  system's unique optical properties. 
              Specifically, intercalates  will be varied to test for effects of
              polarizability, donor  strength, number of hydrogen bonds, and intercalate
              size.  Hosts  will be varied to test for ionicity and structure dependence.  
              Physical parameters tested will be the optical transmission and  reflection to
              determine possible changes in the electronic band  structure; modulation
              spectroscopy to determine band structure  critical points and optical switching
              efficiency; weight gain to  find the amount of intercalate per formula unit;
              x-ray analysis for  lattice structure changes; magnetic resonance for
              intercalate  mobility and vibrational spectra for phonon contributions.  These 
              goals are appropriate for research at an undergraduate institution.  ***
