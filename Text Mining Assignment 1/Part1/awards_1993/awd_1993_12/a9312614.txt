Abstract    :
              9312614  Haynes         This award is for the development of software and
              curricular  materials to support the use of a dialect of the Scheme programming
               language in undergraduate computer science courses. The simplicity  and power
              of Scheme that account for its widespread use in computer  science research
              also explain its increasing use in education. This  project, complementary to
              the one at Oberlin College, stresses the  development of the programming
              environment and tools. The  programming environment will be portable to a wide
              range of  implementations and window systems and will support graphical user 
              interface development, hypertext authoring and delivery, object-  oriented
              programming, and static type analysis, among other modes  of programming and
              courseware development.         Indiana University will investigate the use of
              Scheme in a  variety of courses, including but not limited to introductory 
              programming, programming languages, mathematical methods, data  structures, and
              artificial intelligence. Teaching materials to be  developed include computer
              assisted instruction courseware,  outlines and visual aids for a variety of
              curricular options,  laboratory manuals, and exercise sets including software
              support  and solutions. Curricular knowledge, materials, and software will  be
              disseminated through summer workshops, Internet, professional  meetings, and
              publications. Evaluation instruments will assess the  effectiveness of Scheme
              as a first programming language and the  utility of the curricular materials
              developed by this project.  ***
