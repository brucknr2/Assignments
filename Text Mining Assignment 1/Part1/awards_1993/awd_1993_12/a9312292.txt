Abstract    :
              Delaney/Helmreich  9312292      The investigator willconduct ethnographic
              research among a group of scientists who work in the discipline of artificial
              life, a field dedicated to the computer modeling and simulation of biological
              systems.  The study will investigate the practical ways in which artificial
              life scientists - a multidisciplinary set of biologist, computer scientists,
              economists, and physicists - put together their models of living systems.  The
              investigator will be particularly concerned to understand how conceptions of
              gender, kinship, class, nation, race, economy, history, and cosmology/religion
              might influence people's computational models of biological phenomena.   
              Research will be undertaken at the Santa Fe Institute for the Sciences of
              Complexity in Santa Fe, New Mexico, a center for artificial life research. 
              Interviews, participant observation, and archival work will be the primary
              research methods.  The study will build on insights developed in the literature
              on the ethnography of scientific culture.  Taking methodological and
              theoretical cues from recent breakthroughs in the field, the project will
              attempt to understand how the content of artificial life work is inflected by
              the social, cultural, political, and economic contexts within which artificial
              life scientists work.    The dissertation resulting from the research will
              extend the insights of anthropological studies of science to a discipline
              concerned with both analytic and synthetic methods.  It will also contribute to
              new work on the ethnography of transnational communities.  In addition, it will
              add a socio-cultural perspective to deba tes about the applications, ethical
              implications, and future of artificial life.    ***   Louttit            ` `
