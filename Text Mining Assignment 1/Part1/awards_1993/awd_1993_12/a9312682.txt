Abstract    :
              The overall objective of this workshop is to critically                        
              examine current needs for strong motion data to support                        
              advances in earthquake hazard mitigation.  The requirements                    
              include a complete definition of the earthquake wavefield                      
              that may effect engineering structures as a function of                        
              earthquake source conditions and propagation path: range,                      
              depth, geology and topography.  Both deterministic and                         
              random characterizations are considered.                                       
                                                                                             
              Specific objectives of the workshop include:                                   
                                                                                             
                Review past and current activities in earthquake strong                      
                motion recording, processing, archiving, analysis, and                       
                application.                                                                 
                                                                                             
                Identify crucial strong motion data needs in earthquake                      
                engineering and engineering seismology.                                      
                                                                                             
                Develop a strategic plan to fulfill those needs.                             
                                                                                             
                Explore and implement a working group to coordinate,                         
                advise and provide supporting details for implementation                     
                of the plan, and to oversee the activities initiated to                      
                implement the plan.                                                          
                                                                                             
              The objective will be accomplished in a 1-1/2 day workshop                     
              involving geotechnical and structural engineers and earth                      
              scientists.
