Abstract    :
              9312649  Dietz         Under this project, previously developed research tools
              for  computer architecture performance analysis and for assembler,  compiler,
              and translator construction will be adapted and augmented  to create the
              foundation for an experimental approach to integrated  system design at the
              undergraduate level. The emphasis will be on  making the tools powerful and
              easy-to-use, providing software  support, and developing tool-based modular
              experiments tied to  specific concepts in computer system design. These
              experiments will  enhance traditional courses, especially those involving
              computer  architecture and compilers. At the lowest level, the tools will 
              facilitate experimentation with simple concepts in architecture  design and
              system software construction. At the highest level, they  will support
              experiments that allow students to examine design  tradeoffs in complete
              systems, where the interaction of  architecture and system software is varied
              and evaluated. This new  and innovative educational material will be utilized
              in a new  Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering degree program and  also,
              as appropriate, in the Computer Science program at Purdue.          The
              dissemination plan makes heavy use of electronic  distribution. Videotapes and
              teleconferences, produced using  Purdue's Continuing Engineering Education
              facilities, will provide  "electronic instructors' manuals" to help other
              schools adopt the  tools and experiments.  ***
