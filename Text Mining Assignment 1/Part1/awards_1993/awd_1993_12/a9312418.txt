Abstract    :
              The proposed research will investigate whether or not effective               
              stress finite element analyses can provide a rational basis for               
              deciding when staged construction can safely proceed. It will use              
              the case history of the project Terminal Portuario de Sergipe (TPS)            
              in Brazil to focus on two principal questions: 1. can two-                     
              dimensional consolidation explain large increases in lateral                   
              deformation with time, as opposed to undrained creep; and 2. is              
              a very advanced but complex model of clay behavior required (having            
              anisotropy, non-linearity within yield surface, etc.), or will the             
              very simple Modified Cam Clay Model suffice? The research is                   
              considered high risk based on past experience with using                     
              effective stress models to analyze foundation problems.
