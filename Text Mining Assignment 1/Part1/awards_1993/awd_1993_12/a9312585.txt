Abstract    :
              9312585  Gonzalez Cruz  This planning grant is to conduct a preliminary 
              investigation of the heat transfer process of spray cooling  used for high heat
              flux applications.  Specific tasks to be  accomplished during a preliminary
              study, which will be  included in a full Minority Research Initiation Proposal,
               are as follows:  1) expand upon an existing literature  review in spray
              cooling research and applications, 2)  establish contacts with the
              manufacturing industry, 3)  develop a detailed description of the experimental
              tasks to  study the thermal behavior of the spray and its  surroundings, 4)
              present results from a current  investigation, 5) develop  a general thermal
              model.  ***
