Abstract    :
              9312146  Xu and Haynes      The proposed project is to develop a prototype
              bilingual  (English-Chinese) herbarium database of the plant collections at 
              Sun Yatsen University in China. Through cooperation between  researchers at the
              University of Alabama and the Sun Yatsen  University in Guangzhou, China, the
              existing inventory of  approximately 150,000 specimens at the Sun Yatsen
              Herbarium will  be entered into a computer database which is accessible in both
               English and Chinese.  This may serve as a prototype for other  bilingual
              herbarium databases.  This is particularly important  for US researchers who
              currently have very limited access to  information in China's herbaria, which
              include collections from  not only China but also Southeast Asia, a vital area
              for tropical  biodiversity.    The project is expected to result in a database
              in English  summarizing the label information of all plant collections at the 
              Herbarium and in software that provides an interface for Chinese  and English
              database management.
