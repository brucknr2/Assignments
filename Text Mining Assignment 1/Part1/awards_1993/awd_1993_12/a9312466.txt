Abstract    :
              This award provides partial support for the Plant Biochemistry                 
              Summer Course to beheld from June 30 to July 18, 1993 on the                   
              campus of University of Wisconsin in Madison, Wisconsin.  The                  
              general format of the course consists of two morning lectures                  
              and a formal evening discussion led by the lecturer of the day,                
              followed by an informal discussion by all participants.                        
              Tutorials are planned as well.  Approximately 25 lectures                      
              will be given by the world experts in various branches of plant                
              biochemistry fields.  The course is organized to accommodate up                
              to 50 students and is open to graduate students, potsdocs,                     
              industrial scientists, and professors.  The purpose is to expose               
              interested students to modern aspects of plant biochemistry and                
              increase general level of interest to                                          
              plant biochemistry.  The course is jointly supported by the U.S.               
              Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Department of Energy.
