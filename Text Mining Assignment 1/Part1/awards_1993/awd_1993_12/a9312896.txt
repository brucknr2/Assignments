Abstract    :
              9312986  Berndt    A plasma spray apparatus with an axial feed torch will e
              developed,  and the production of nanoparticle and nanostructures from colloids
               and powders will be investigated.  A mass spectrometer will be used  to
              analyze on line gas composition and particle size distribution,  as well as to
              form nanostructured thin layers.  The project  objectives include basic
              understanding of the interactions of  colloids and powders with high
              temperature plasma gases, and the  optimization of a scalable plasma torch
              manufacturing process to  produce ultrafine particles and particle-based solid
              structures.   This interdisciplinary project is well supported by industry and 
              the host university.  Main outcomes will be improving plasma torch  processing,
              developing specific instrumentation, and proposing  suitable models for the
              corresponding physical and chemical  processes.    The work is relevant to
              plasma spray development, ultrafine  particle generation at high production
              rates, and nanostructured  coating.  ***
