Abstract    :
                9312208  Connett    Technical Narrative:    A conference, entitled
              Applications of  Hypergroups and Related Measure Algebras, will  take place at
              the University of Washington in  Seattle from July 31 - August 06, 1993.  
              Participating in this conference will be three  Moroccan and five Tunisian
              mathematicians who  have a research interest in this topic; these  individuals
              will also be participants in a post-  conference workshop organized by Drs. W.
              Connett  and A. Schwartz of the University of Missouri at  St. Louis.  The
              purpose of the workshop is to  discuss and develop collaborative research 
              projects involving the group from North Africa  and their U.S. counterparts. 
              This cooperative  activity will bring together highly regarded  experts from
              the U.S., Morocco, and Tunisia  representing a number of universities.  A goal
              of  this joint meeting is to reinforce and extend an  international network of
              American and North  African mathematicians that will endure beyond  the
              conference/workshop.  This activity partially  supports the participation of
              approximately 12  U.S. and 8 North African scientists.     This
              conference/workshop in mathematical science  fulfills the program objective of
              advancing  scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts  in the United
              States and North Africa to combine  complementary talents and present research 
              results in areas of strong mutual interest and  competence.  This activity has
              an educational and  outreach effort that has the potential for  generating new
              scientific activity and new  international linkages.  ***
