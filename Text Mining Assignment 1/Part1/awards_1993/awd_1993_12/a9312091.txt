Abstract    :
              9312091  Anson  This project is in the general area of analytical and surface
              chemistry  and in the subfield of electrochemistry.  During the tenure of this 
              five-year continuing grant, Professor Anson and his students will  design,
              synthesize, and evaluate new surface confined electrocatalysts  for the direct,
              four-electron reduction of dioxygen to water and for  the electrooxidation of
              organic substrates such as methanol, ethanol,  formaldehyde, and formic acid. 
              The general applicability of  electrocatalysis by adsorbed electroactive
              ligands and their metal  complexes will also be explored.  Because many
              electrocatalytic species  are surface confined using polymeric matrices, the
              impact of solution  composition-controlled thermodynamic driving forces on the
              kinetics of  electron transfer across polymer-electrolyte interfaces will also
              be  investigated.  Finally, the electrochemical behavior of metastable 
              transition metal-dioxygen complexes, long believed to be key  intermediates in
              the electrocatalytic reduction of dioxygen, will be  probed to afford insights
              into the mechanisms of these transition  metal-promoted processes.  %%%  The
              rational design of efficient, economical fuel cells and batteries  is
              predicated on a fundamental understanding of the electrochemical  processes
              involved.  This research is aimed at enhancing knowledge of  how
              electrochemical transformations of inexpensive substrate molecules  can be
              facilitated through electrocatalysis for use in these  technologically and
              societally important devices.  ***
