Abstract    :
              9312141  Breig  The proposed research will lead to an improved understanding of
              the  coordinated behaviors of neutral atomic hydrogen and the  temperature in
              the polar thermosphere near solstice.  It will give  special attention to
              several modes of coupling between this  atmospheric region and its neighbors at
              higher and lower altitudes.   Local H concentrations are to be derived from the
              condition of  charge-exchange equilibrium between hydrogen and oxygen atoms and
               ions in conjunction with satellite plasma observations near the F-  peak. 
              Measurements of ion temperature at these heights provide  good estimates of the
              neutral gas temperature.  Principal use will  be made of the unique, and still
              highly useful, sets of aeronomic  data acquired with the Atmosphere Explorer
              (AE)-D and Dynamics  Explorer (DE)-2 satellites, both in high-inclination polar
              orbits.   General emphasis will be given to the latitudinal and longitudinal 
              distributions of H density and neutral temperature through the  summer and
              winter polar thermospheres, seeking a more firm  confirmation of earlier
              indications for a polar hydrogen depletion  and a related enhancement in
              temperature in this region.  A  multitude of comparisons will also be
              undertaken - seasonal  differences between summer and winter high latitudes and
              the effect  of different levels of solar activity.  These results should help 
              fill a serious deficiency of reliable observational polar data, and  contribute
              to refinements in current models of the high latitude  thermosphere.  ***
