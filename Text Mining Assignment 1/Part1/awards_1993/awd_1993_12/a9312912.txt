Abstract    :
              Funding is provided to co-sponsor an initial meeting of the newly              
              organized IGBP Core Project, Land-Ocean Interactions in the Coastal            
              Zone (LOICZ).  The purpose of the meeting is to recommend                      
              priorities and strategies for implementing the Project's Science               
              Plan.  Because of the complex nature and interrelatedness of the               
              world's coastal zone, representation and participation by all                  
              nations having significant coastal zones is considered highly                  
              important to the project's objectives of scientific description,               
              global integration and predictive resource assessments for every               
              coastal zone.
