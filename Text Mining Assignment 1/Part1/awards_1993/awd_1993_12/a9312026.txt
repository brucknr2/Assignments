Abstract    :
              9312026  Frey     A strategy for stimulating student interest in and commitment
              to  science is to engage them in active discovery of reality by  taking them
              out of the classroom into the field.  Microcomputer-  Based Laboratories
              (MBLs), which typically consist of a computer,  sensors, graphing software, and
              instructional materials, were  developed to give students a hands-on learning
              method and have  been shown to improve student performance.  Results of the
              Phase  I Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) study establish the 
              technical basis for going beyond the conventional MBL by  integrating existing,
              state-of-the-art, low-cost, palm-sized,  portable data acquisition equipment
              into a new educational tool,  Earth Explorer, a Portable Microcomputer-Based
              Laboratory (PMBL),  which will allow students to collect data without being
              directly  connected to the computer yet permit them to download that data 
              after collection.  The objectives of the Phase II study focus on  (1) creating
              Earth Explorer courseware for additional sixth grade  science education units;
              (2) modifying and expanding the Earth  Explorer hardware; (3) improving and
              enhancing the Earth Explorer  software and related materials; (4) creating
              teacher education  materials for understanding and effectively using the Earth 
              Explorer system; (5) designing and implementing an effective  evaluation
              process; and (6) conducting a national field test  involving schools
              representing socioeconomic and racial diversity  in their student populations. 
                By providing an instructional system, the Earth Explorer, that is  compatible
              with and usable in a broad range of curriculum  frameworks, the project will
              aim to provide an opportunity for  students to benefit from instructional
              strategies which  capitalize on student interest through active hands-on 
              participation.  ***
