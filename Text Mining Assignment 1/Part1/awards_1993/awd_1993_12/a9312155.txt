Abstract    :
              9312155  Mitchell       This award adds three higher education institutions to
              the  MOREnet state network.  The new institutions connect to a hub  located at
              the University of Missouri at Columbia.  Faculty and  students at the
              institutions will benefit from access to the  resources of the Internet,
              including libraries and supercomputers.   In addition, they will be able to
              communicate and collaborate with  colleagues at other campuses in pursuit of
              research and educational  projects.  The award provides partial support of the
              project for  two years.  ***
