Abstract    :
              9312219  Rayson  This proposal in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program
              involves   the investigation of a new biologically-derived heavy metal recovery
                agent for extraction of heavy metals from contaminated wastewater.  The  
              recovery medium consists of cultured cells from the anther from the   native
              flower Datura innoxia.  The long term goal of the proposed   research is the
              development of a practical system for the in situ   removal of heavy metals
              from contaminated water, such as industrial and   mining wastewater streams.   
              Professor Rayson and his students will use solid state NMR, fluorescence   and
              infrared spectroscopy to characterize the metal ion binding sites on   the
              biologically-derived materials.  A thorough characterization of the   binding
              sites will lead to the identification and synthesis of model   sites on ion
              exchange media for the extraction of heavy metal ions.  %%%  Professor Rayson
              will investigate the potential applications of   biologically-derived heavy
              metal recovery agents for the remediation of   contaminated water.  The
              technique has potential for significant impact   in the global problem of
              contaminated wastewater cleanup.  ***
