Abstract    :
              This Small Grants for Exploratory Research (SGER) project will                 
              provide for the access to and compilation of a unique data base of             
              in situ, daily averaged measurements of solar and terrestrial                  
              surface radiation over the central Arctic Basin.  These data were              
              collected from a series of Soviet drifting ice stations from 1950              
              to 1991.  No comparable data exists anywhere.  Russian researchers             
              from the Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute (AARI) in St.                 
              Petersburg have recently agreed to make this singular and large                
              data set available to U.S. investigators.  The data will be                    
              transposed from hand-written logs and archived on CD-ROM for                   
              distribution to the U.S. academic community.  The data have                    
              multidisciplinary applications relevant to global change research,             
              including climatology, oceanography, sea ice studies, meteorology,             
              radiative transfer, remote sensing, and forecast modeling.  Having             
              this high quality and comprehensive Russian information available              
              soon to the U.S. research community is timely for planning new U.S.            
              Arctic Ocean research programs.
