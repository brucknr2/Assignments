Abstract    :
              9312606  Kivelson  This proposal concerns the low energy implications of strong 
              electronic correlations. The PI proposes to continue studying: 1)  The
              collective properties of the two-dimensional electron gas in a  strong magnetic
              field, especially the nature of the insulating  state (which the PI previously
              identified as a "Hall Insulator"),  and the experiments which have sought to
              measure the charge of the  quasi particles in the fractional quantum Hall
              effect. 2) The  implications of frustrated phase separation for the properties
              of  the cuprate superconductors. 3) The effects of intramolecular  correlation
              effects in molecular solids with particular reference  to the alkali-doped
              fullerenes. 4) The properties of very dirty  superconductors especially in two
              dimensions.  %%%  This proposal involves the theoretical investigation of, and
              the  new physics involved in, condensed matter systems in which the  electrons
              interact with one another in non-standard ways - that is  in ways in which the
              usual averaged-electron methods break down.  The PI proposes to examine such
              systems - so called "strongly  correlated systems" - as follows: a) an electron
              gas in two  dimensions in strong magnetic fields, b) the tendency of certain 
              magnetic materials (antiferromagnets) to phase separate c) possible 
              intramolecular mechanisms for superconductivity in the newly-found 
              alkali-metal doped fullerenes and d) the properties of dirty or  disordered
              superconductors. This type of work is at the forefront  of issues in
              contemporary condensed matter theory.  ***
