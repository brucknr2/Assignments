Abstract    :
              9312996 Ullman          THis project develop a prototype computer based design
              aid that give engineering decision support over a project lifecycle based on
              whatever incomplte, inconsistent, and interdependent information is available. 
              The  system does not require knowledge beyond that normally used by engineers
              in their standard work experience.  The resulting prototype supports
              engineering teams in reaching a decision about an issue based on current
              knowledge about alternatives to solve the issue and arguments supporting or
              opposing those alternatives.  The level of support improves as the level of
              knowledge improves.  The techniques developed integrate and support traditional
              decision making tools such as optimization, CPM, and decision trees.   The
              decision support philosophy and system are validated through a set of balanced
              experiments. ***
