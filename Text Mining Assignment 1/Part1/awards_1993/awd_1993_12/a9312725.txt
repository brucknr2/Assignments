Abstract    :
              9312725  Atkinson    This two-year award will support U.S.-Italy cooperative
              research  between Dr. Richard Atkinson, Atkinson-Noland Associates, and 
              Professor Luigia Binda of the Politecnico di Milano in Italy.   They will test
              to failure a full size unreinforced masonry  building under a set of carefully
              controlled vertical and lateral  loads.  The Italian research plan also
              includes a compressive  program of material and substructure tests, use of non-
               destructive tests prior to and after structural loading,  extensive analytical
              studies to predict performance, and repair  and retest of the damaged
              structure.    The planned experiment in Pavia, Italy, with the associated 
              supporting research provides a unique opportunity for U.S.  investigators to
              participate in a major research program and to  obtain research results
              applicable to the U.S. building  infrastructure.  The U.S. has never tested a
              full-sized, masonry  building such as will be tested in Italy under this
              research  program.  Current U.S. understanding of the behavior of such 
              building has been extrapolated from individual component tests or  has been
              estimated from observed building response after a major  loading from a
              catastrophic event.  The Pavia experiment provides  an opportunity to test such
              a building under controlled loading  conditions, with known materials, and with
              known construction  methods.  It should provide extensive building response and
               strength data of a type not now available.  * * *
