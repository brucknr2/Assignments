Abstract    :
              9312854  Savage  PI will collect brachiopod and conodont faunas of suspect
              terranes  in central Alaska and compare these faunas with known faunas in 
              southeastern Alaska and cratonic North America.  The comparison of  these
              faunas will help determine the history of terrane displacment  in Alaska.  The
              field effort will be coordinated with the U.S.  Geological Survey.
