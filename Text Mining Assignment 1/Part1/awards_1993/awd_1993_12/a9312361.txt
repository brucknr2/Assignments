Abstract    :
              This award provides partial support for a symposium entitled "The              
              Past, Present and Future of Plant Biology" to be held on May 27 -              
              29, 1993 at Washington University.  The symposium is organized to              
              celebrate the life-long achievements of Dr. Joseph E. Varner.                  
              The program is designed to encompass major past and present                    
              achievements in broad areas of plant sciences as well as future                
              research directions in plant biology.  Three major sessions                    
              include; (1) from structure and function to molecule, (2) from                 
              molecules back to structure and function, and (3) on the horizon.              
              Speakers are encouraged to speculate and discuss the implications              
              of their research findings for future directions in plant biology              
              research, which the organizers hope will promote discussions                   
              among the  participants.  The NSF award will specifically support              
              graduate students and postdocs attend this symposium and be                    
              exposed to a slightly different kind of discussion from that                   
              of traditional research conferences.
