Abstract    :
                 The initial objective of this research is to develop techniques  that
              significantly reduce the performance cost incurred by  program profiling. 
              Compiler techniques will be developed  that exploit program semantics and 
              features found in existing  architectures to reduce the cost of profiling.  New
               architecture  techniques will be developed that support low-cost profiling. 
              The  high cost of existing profiling approaches precludes on-line  profiling. 
              However, on-line profiling is highly desirable because  it could provide more 
              accurate characterization of a program's  behavior.  A specific goal of this 
              work is to reduce the cost of  program profiling so that on-line profiling 
              becomes feasible.  On-  line profiling is the enabling technology for adaptive 
              code-  optimizations, which will also be studied in this project.  Code 
              optimizations that adapt to changing patterns in program behavior  can 
              potentially provide significant performance improvement  compared with the 
              traditional static compile-time optimizations.  An additional objective of this
               project is to develop new low-  cost program profiling approaches that can
              more  completely  characterize program behavior, including profiling of
              multiple-  basic-block traces and accurate characterization of data cache 
              behavior.
