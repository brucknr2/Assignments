Abstract    :
              9312072  Schlom    This is a proposal submitted to the Small Grants for 
              Exploratory Research (SGER) Program.  The PI proposed to use  the molecular
              beam epitaxy (MBE) techniques to grown stacked  thin film layers of
              feeroelectric oxides with buffers.  The  objective was to prepare thin film
              ferroelectrics with  controlled grain boundaries, and to study their effects on
               the problem of DC ferroelectric degradation.    %%%    This is a SGER project.
               The project plans to grown stacked  thin film layers of ferrorelectric oxides
              with buffers.  The  goal is to prepare expitaxial film with controlled grain 
              boundaries.  Through these grain boundaries, the project  intends to study the
              effects of these boundaries on the  problem of DC degradation.  This problem
              plagues oxide  ferroelectrics as electronic device materials.  If its cause 
              can be ascertained, its solution can make the oxide  ferroelectrics important
              electronic materials of the future,  suitable as non-volatile memory materials.
