Abstract    :
              This planning grant, submitted in conjunction with the                         
              Minority Research Initiation Program, will provide support                     
              to develop a research proposal  to test the hypothesis that                    
              nitrate could enhance in situ BTEX biodegradation not only                     
              by increasing the availability of electron acceptors, but                      
              also by fostering favorable changes in the microbial ecology                   
              of the aquifer and fortuitously selecting for a microbial                      
              population capable of degrading BTEX under either aerobic or                   
              denitrifying conditions.
