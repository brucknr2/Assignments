              Terrian  Amino acids are utilized as a neurotransmitter by up to 90% of the
              presynaptic terminals in the human brain.  Glutamate is the principal amino
              acid employed for fast excitatory information transfer between neurons and
              recent electrophysiological studies suggest that the facilitation of glutamate
              release may be required for certain forms of memory and learning.  Studies of
              isolated nerve terminals (synaptosomes) have established that activation of
              protein kinase C (PKC) enhances the release of glutamate and that multiple
              isoforms of this enzyme are present in synaptosomes.  While most
              neurobiologists agree that the glutamate release apparatus is not dependent on
              PKC activation to respond to depolarizing stimuli, it is capable of operating
              more efficiently when PKC substrates have been phosphorylated by PKC.  The
              major hypothesis of Dr. Terrian's proposal is that activated PKC may
              phosphorylate presynaptic proteins which prepare ("prime") the glutamate
              release apparatus to respo nd to localized calcium entry and, thus, enhance the
              probability of release.  Specifically, it is hypothesized that PKC activation
              may increase the number of synaptic vesicles that are available for release by
              disrupting interactions between actin filaments and the inner surface of the
              synaptic plasma membrane.  This actin-based cytoskeletal network is thought to
              constitute a barrier which may normally function to limit access of synaptic
              vesicles to release sites on the plasma membrane.  The overall goal of this
              project is to understand how individual PKC isoforms interact, in concert with
              one another and their neuronal substrates, to modify the cytoskeletal
              architecture of presynaptic terminals and sustain an enhancement of glutamate
              release.  The substrates of PKC which mediate this enhancement of glutamate
              release are unknown, but must exhibit certain defined properties which can be
              directly examined using synaptosomal preparations.  The proposed project will
              identify the individual isoforms of PKC that are activated under conditions
              sufficient for the enhancement of glutamate release.   Results from this study
              will direct the focus of subsequent work in which purified PKC, and individual
              PKC isoforms will be used to identify the individual enzymes and substrate
              proteins that are functionally-linked to glutamate release.  At the same time,
              a study will be conducted to examine the relationship between PKC activation,
              reorganization of the synaptosomal cytoskeleton, and movement of synaptic
              vesicles to release sites on the synaptosomal plasma membrane. ***
