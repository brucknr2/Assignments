Abstract    :
              9312121  Johnson       This project establishes a statewide network of 24 
              institutions, and connects 20 of them to the network.  The other  four schools
              are connected directly  to the Internet, and will  become part of the new
              network.  The newly-connected institutions  include two Board of Regents
              schools, two schools for the disabled,  eight private higher education
              institutions, four tribal  institutions and four vocational technical
              institutes.  Several  K-12 schools and the state library system also will have
              access to  the Internet through the state network.  Faculty and students at 
              the institutions will benefit from access to the resources of the  Internet,
              including libraries and supercomputers.  In addition,  they will be able to
              communicate and collaborate with colleagues at  other campuses in pursuit of
              research and educational projects.   The award provides partial support of the
              project for two years.  ***
