Abstract    :
              9312648  Cushing         Under this project, the Evergreen State College, Oregon
               Graduate Institute of Science & Technology, and the Washington  Center for
              Improving the Quality of Undergraduate Education will  integrate into
              undergraduate curricula at Evergreen State recent  research results in
              object-oriented databases, scientific data  management and visualization,
              higher order logics, and neural  networks. These curricular innovations
              specifically target non-  Ph.D. granting institutions.         Two
              interdisciplinary Evergreen programs will serve as  prototypes: (1) the
              software engineering of scientific  applications, and (2) advanced studies in
              theoretical computer  science, mathematics and cognitive science. Expected
              outcomes of  the work are three-fold: (1) Course materials such as syllabi, 
              workshops, and case studies; (2) A model for non-Ph.D. granting  institutions
              for initiating programs of excellence in advanced  computer science; and (3) A
              model for disseminating computer  science curricular innovation. Incorporated
              in the project are a  number of activities designed to increase the
              participation of  women and minorities, including special efforts with Native 
              Americans.         Dissemination is effected through workshops, designed in 
              conjunction with the Washington Center and conducted jointly by OGI 
              researchers and Evergreen faculty. Workshops addressing course  materials will
              be offered first on a regional basis, using proven  methods for curricular
              innovation. Later, national workshops will  address the curricular innovations
              developed as well as the  development, assessment and regional dissemination of
              those  innovations.  ***
