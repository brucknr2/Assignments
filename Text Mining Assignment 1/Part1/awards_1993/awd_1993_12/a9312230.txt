              Connection"  Lewis-Clark State College  PI:  Scott Cowdrey  NCR-9312230     
              This project connects Lewis-Clark State College to NSFNET through  NorthWestNet
              over a 56 kbps line.  Faculty and students will benefit from  access to the
              resources of the Internet, including libraries and  supercomputers.  In
              addition, they will be able to communicate and  collaborate with colleagues at
              other institutions in pursuit of research  and educational projects.  The award
              provides partial support of the  project for two years.
