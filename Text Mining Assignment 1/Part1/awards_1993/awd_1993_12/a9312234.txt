Abstract    :
              9312234  Sachs  Photo-Electroforming is a new process for the fabrication of
              high-precision micro-electro-mechanical devices directly from computer models. 
              The motivation of the proposed work is to provide to the
              Mirco-Electro-Mechanical Systems community a fabrication method which is
              developed specifically for Micro-Electro-Mechanical (MEM) applications.  One
              goals is to provide sub-millimeter components of materials with unique
              mechanical, electrical and electromagnetic properties which will allow for the
              fabrication of new MEM devices.  A second goal is to provide MEM devices of
              almost arbitrary 3-D geometry with minimal penalty for increased geometric
              complexity.  ***
