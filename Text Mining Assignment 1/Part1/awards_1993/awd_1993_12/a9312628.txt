Abstract    :
              9312628  Draayer   The aim of the program in theoretical nuclear physics at
              Louisiana State University, which is under the direction of Professor J.P.
              Draayer and currently involves five graduate students (four in physics and one
              in computer science) and one postdoctoral research associate, is to give a
              simple but accurate description of the properties of heavy nuclei, like those
              in the rare earth (e.g., erbium) and actinide (e.g., uranium) regions which are
              made up of a large number of protons plus neutrons (greater than 150).  These
              species are heavy enough to display generic features shared with neighboring
              elements and yet show unique individual characteristics that we can use to
              learn about how protons and neutrons interact among themselves and with each
              other inside the nuclear medium.  We are seeking to answer in an intellectually
              honest way questions such as, "Why do rotational and vibrational modes dominate
              the structure of heavy nuclei?"  The research involves training of graduate
              students in critical thinking skills and the use of state-of-the-art computing
              facilities, such as supercomputers (available at centers across the country)
              and parallel machines (available through special "8g" state funding) that will
              help define the next generation of megacomputers.     7'  7   7l  7   7   7`  7
