Abstract    :
              9312249  Isayev       The main objective of the project is to develop basic  
              knowledge for a new science-based technology of continuous   devulcanization of
              vulcanized elastomers.  It is well known that   vulcanized elastomers having a
              three-dimensional network cannot   flow under the effect of heat and/or
              pressure.  It has been   discovered that through the application of certain
              levels of   ultrasolic amplitudes in special devices in the presence of  
              pressure and optionally heat, the three-dimensional network of   vulcanized
              elastomer can be broken down within a short period of   time on the order of
              one second or less.  As a most desirable   consequence, ultrasonically treated
              vulcanized rubber becomes soft,   thereby enabling this material to be
              reprocessed, shaped, and   revulcanized in a manner similar to that employed
              with unvulcanized   elastomer.  The study outlines series of experiments
              enabling us to   (i) identify an aptitude of polysulfidic, monosulfidic, and
              carbon-   carbon crosslinks to ultrasonic devulcanization; (ii) to establish  
              optimal conditions for the devulcanization process; (iii) to   evaluate the
              rheological properties of devulcanized rubbers; and   (iv) to measure the
              mechanical performance of revulcanized rubber   products made of devulcanized
              rubber.       The recycling of vulcanized elastomers (primarily used tires)  
              has become a major environmental and social issue.  The development   of a
              novel technique for the reclaiming of rubber will have a   significant impact
              on the further expansion of a recycling  technology  base through the
              optimization of the process and new  discoveries.
