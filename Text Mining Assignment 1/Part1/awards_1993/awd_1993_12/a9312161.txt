Abstract    :
              9312161  Beatley  Management of natural hazards raises many ethical questions. 
              They  arise at all stages from prior mitigation to reconstruction, and  with
              respect to all kinds of hazards, whether earthquakes or  floods.  Rarely do
              those making management policies and decisions  see them explicitly as
              involving ethical choices; typically, they  view them in technical, political
              and economic terms.  This project  seeks to expand the understanding of the
              nature of ethical issues  which arise in the area of natural hazards
              management, and of the  variety of concepts, standards and other ethical tools
              that could  be useful to public officials in resolving these issues.  The 
              research tasks are conceptual and empirical, involving further  review of the
              relevant literatures and development of a conceptual  framework, fieldwork on a
              set of hazard case studies which raise  significant ethical questions, and the
              preparation of casebook and  ethical guidelines.  The literature review will
              cull the hazards  and disaster literature and the applied ethics literature in
              order  to identify central ethical questions of use in developing a  framework
              of ethical concepts and cases of particular relevance for  the fieldwork
              portion of the study.  Case studies will collect and  compile background
              materials and conduct telephone and on-site  interviews.  The casebook will
              contain summaries of the case  studies, each focusing on ethical issues and
              ending with a set of  questions highlighting the ethical problems, and a set of
               guidelines attempting to facilitate ethical judgment for hazards  management. 
              The book will be widely distributed.  ***
