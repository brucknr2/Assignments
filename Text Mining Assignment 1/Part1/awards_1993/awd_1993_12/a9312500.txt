Abstract    :
                   This conference is held in New Hampshire, July 19-23, 1993,               
              and focusses on recent advances in the understanding of oxidation              
              of metallic, intermetallic, ceramic and ceramic composite                      
              materials.  Individual sessions address impurity segregation at                
              oxide interfaces and grain boundaries, structure of oxide scales,              
              growth mechanisms of aluminum oxide scales, oxidation of ceramic               
              structural materials, mechanisms of oxidation in intermetallic                 
              alloys (titanium and nickel aluminides), and stress-induced                    
              cracking of oxide scales.  These discussions of oxidation in                   
              advanced materials includes an international group of scientists as            
              well as students entering the field.

                   The interest in oxidation of high temperature materials                   
              relates to tailoring their chemistry and structure to prolong their            
              useful life in structural applications such as engines and high                
              temperature furnaces.
