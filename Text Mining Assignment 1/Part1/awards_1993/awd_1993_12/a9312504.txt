Abstract    :
              Ji  9312504  This research will address an important open problem in supervised
              learning using feedforward multi-layer neural networks:  how to evaluate
              generalization performance of the networks using network-parameter-dependent
              information.  The focus is on large networks used for the purpose of function
              approximation.  The objectives are: 1) to evaluate the generalization error
              utilizing the network-parameter-dependent information; 2) to incorporate
              dynamics of training algorithms into evaluation of generalization error;  3) 
              to design network complexity in order to achieve more predictable
              generalization on a small training set for large networks with fixed
              architecture.  To achieve these objectives, statistical methods will be used to
              develop a general relationship between the generalization error and the
              expected network complexity.   And a Bayesian network is utilized to relate
              dynamics of training algorithms to the generalization performance of the
              networks.  The impact of the proposed research is to important open problems in
              combined supervised and reinforcement learning, and high-speed high-capacity
              large optical neural networks.  ***   v       s  t      APPS    HLP           @
