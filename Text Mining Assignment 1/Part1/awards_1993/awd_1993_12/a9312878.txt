Abstract    :
                9312878   Mangel      The retina is the tissue of the eye containing the
              photoreceptors.   In mammals these cells are of two basic types, rods and
              cones.  The  rod cells are most sensitive in dim light, while the cone cells 
              operate best in bright light.  When different light levels are  maintained, the
              change in visual responsivness is called  adaptation.  At another layer in the
              retina lie a whole class of  cells called horizontal cells, because they
              collect input over a  fairly wide area of photoreceptors.  These horizontal
              cells provide  input to the nerve cells fof the optic nerve, called ganglion 
              cells, which provide the output of the retina to the brain for  vision.  This
              proposal will use physiological, pharmacological and  anatomical techniques to
              clarify the functional role of the  horizontal cells in the rod and cone
              pathways.  Different levels of  light intentsity will be used to see how the
              rod and cone cells  influence the horizontal cell activity at different levels
              of light  adaptation.  Pharmacological agents and electrophysiology will be 
              used to determine the functional connections between horizontal  cells and
              ganglion cells at different levels of light adaptation.  These studies are
              important for understanding the basic property of  adaptation in visual
              function, and will have impact on  computational models of visual systems as
              well.  ***
