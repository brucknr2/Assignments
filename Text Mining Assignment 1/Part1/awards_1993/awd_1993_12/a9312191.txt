Abstract    :
              9312191  Reynolds       The Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County
              requests  support in the form of hardware, software, and communication 
              services to provide their facilities with a 56 thousand bits per  second
              connection to the Los Nettos regional network.  Direct  connection to Los
              Nettos, a mid-level network, will provide the  museum with improved access to
              Internet resources.       By linking to the midlevel and national networks, the
              Museum  will be able to maintain and enhance a position of leadership in 
              research and educational innovation with remote access to  computational
              resources such as super computing facilities, data  bases and information
              services, high speed communication, file  transfer and remote login, and access
              to library resources.  This  also a unique opportunity for the Museum to
              explore innovative  educational resources.  Museum educational programs,
              collection  management and curatorial research will benefit from the link.  ***
