Abstract    :
              9312318  Williamson    This project funds the creation of an electronic
              information  management and dissemination server, the History of Global Change 
              Information Server (HGCIS), for the use of economic historians  studying global
              change.  The server will evolve into a primary  communications channel between
              researchers of the economic  history of global change and into a repository of
              critical  knowledge, technical details, and general subject matter  expertise
              on the economic history of global change.     The HGCIS's goals are:       1) 
              to provide an international forum for global change       researchers to
              exchange ideas, opinions, and data;       2)  to develop on-line global change
              databases with search       capabilities and accessibility to all researchers; 
                   3)  to maintain an on-line library of papers, proceedings,       and
              electronic meetings.  To achieve these goals, the proposed global change
              network server  will assemble a membership registry database, bulletin boards, 
              electronic conference rooms, research rooms, global change  databases, and
              electronic libraries.
