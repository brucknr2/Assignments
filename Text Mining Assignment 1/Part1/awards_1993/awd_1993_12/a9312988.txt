Abstract    :
              9312988  Hinata    This award will support a cooperative research  project
              between Professor Satoshi Hinata,  Department of Physics, Auburn University, 
              Alabama, and Dr. Tadashi Hirayama, Solar  Physics Division, National
              Astronomical  Observatory, Japan.  During a six month visit,  Professor Hinata
              will conduct research on ohmic  heating of the solar atmosphere.  The 
              collaborators will calculate the dynamical  response of the whole loop plasma
              (from lower  chromosphere to corona) heated by the  dissipation of force-free
              currents, where the  currents density is determined by the  requirement that
              the coronal energy loss is  balanced by local ohmic dissipation.  Dynamical 
              calculations are necessary to obtain a  meaningful interpretation of the
              variable  UV/EUV fluxes, because the transition layer  plasmas are almost
              always in dynamical states,  probably due to heating in the other parts of  the
              atmosphere as well as in the transition  layer itself.    Results of the
              research should contribute to  knowledge concerning environmental issues in 
              the chemistry and dynamics of ozone.  In  addition, it could contribute to
              studies of  climate change that also depend on the  variation of the total and
              UV/EUV solar  radiative output.  Professor Hinata's expertise  lies in the area
              of electric fields in the  solar atmosphere.  Professor Hirayama is a well 
              known solar physicist who first suggested  chromospheric evaporations.  Two
              other  scientists in Professor Hirayama's laboratory,  who are experts in
              dynamical behavior of  transition layer plasma and magnetic field 
              calculations, are participating in the project.   This project is supported by
              the NSF-CGP  (Center for Global Partnership) Science  Fellowship Program.  ***
