Abstract    :
              The goal of this research is to develop an innovative and unified  methodology
              for designing self-repairable ultra-large integated  (ULSI) circuits and
              multi-chip module (MCM) chips.  This research  will exploit the combinatorial
              optimization capabilities offered by  adaptive circuits consisting of simple
              threshold devices  interconnected programmable resistive networks for the
              purpose of  adding a self-repair capability to hardware devices.  The proposed 
              research will be conducted in three phases.  In the first phase,  theoretical
              models for both regular array logic and unstructured  random logic repar
              problems will be developed, and entensive  simulations will be performed to
              measure the performance of the  adaptive self-repair circuits.  In the second
              phase, adaptive  circuits will be designed using CMOS technology, and
              experimental  chips willbe fabricated and tested as "proofs. of concept."  In
              the  third phase, software will be developed to allow the proposed  adaptive
              bult-in-self-repar circuits to be automatically  synthesized by VLSI/CAD
              software and invorporated within macro  blocks.  This project initiates a new
              area of research that is a  natural sequel to the on-going works in the fields
              of Built-In-  Self-Testing (BIST) and Design for Testability (DFT).
