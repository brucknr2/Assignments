Abstract    :
              9312435  McNaughton  This project will consist of experimental studies of the
              control of ecosystem processes (emphasizing primary productivity, consumption
              by grazers and secondary productivity, plant mineral uptake as related to plant
              and herbivore nutrition, and soil mineralization rates) by nutrients,
              emphasizing, but not restricted to, nitrogen, in grazing ecosystems supporting
              abundant native ungulate populations.  Study sites will be in Serengeti
              National Park, Tanzania, and Yellowstone N.P., USA.  experiments will measure
              (1) the level of N required to saturate ecosystem processes, (2) the relative
              effect of small, multiple N applications (as might result from chronic air
              pollution) compared to a single, larger application equivalent to a urine dose
              (a natural recycling pathway), (3) the potential for N fertilization to induce
              deficiencies of other nutrients, as expressed in primary productivity,
              microbial activity, or properties of forages as an ungulate nutrient source,
              and (4) the effect of carbon enrichment, which will surely occur as atmospheric
              CO2 enrichment proceeds.  These studies will contribute to a quantitative
              understanding of carrying capacity in native grazing ecosystems on two
              continents and in radically different climates, add to our understanding of the
              appropriate conservation strategies in ecosystems supporting abundant ungulate
              populations, and provide information about two components if global change
              (chronic nutrient enrichment from air pollution, and carbon enrichment) in
              ecosystems supporting large grazing mammals.
