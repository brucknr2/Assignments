Abstract    :
              This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the work of              
              Professor Gable at Oregon State University to investigate                      
              mechanisms and synthetic applications of organometallic reactions              
              relevant to catalysis. The key question to be addressed is                     
              whether olefins react with only the oxygen of metal oxides in a                
              concerted fashion or whether an intermediate metallaoxetane is                 
              formed. Based on preliminary data on ethylene, norbornene, and                 
              norbornadiene, the initial systems to be studied are reversible                
              reactions of olefins with  various rhenium oxides. The objective               
              is to determine quantitative structure-reactivity relationships,               
              which include the thermodynamics, kinetics, isotope effects, and               
              the Thorton analysis to probe the symmetry of the transition                   
              state. These mechanistic studies will then be extended to other                
              alkene oxidants, in particular osmium tetraoxide.

              In this project Professor Gable will investigate the mechanism of              
              the oxidation reaction of olefins with metal oxides and thereby                
              provide much needed insight into an area which is of fundamental               
              importance. The main targets are to develop quantitative                       
              structure-reactivity relationships and probing transition states               
              for rhenium oxides, which studies will then be extended to other               
              oxidants in the pursuit of new catalysts for application in high               
              volume industrial processes.
