Abstract    :
              9312244  Teague  This award is for continued support of the U.S. Solar
              Terrestrial  Energy Program (STEP) Coordination Office (USSCO).  The USSCO 
              interacts with the international space science community for the  purpose of
              (1) collecting and disseminating STEP-related  information and data, (2)
              coordinating joint campaigns for data  acquisition and analysis, and (3)
              organizing professional society  meetings and special sessions.  USSCO
              activities are crucial for  coordinating the various federal agency activities
              related to STEP  with the international scientific community.  It also
              facilitates  communication of the STEP activities to the U.S. community.  ***
