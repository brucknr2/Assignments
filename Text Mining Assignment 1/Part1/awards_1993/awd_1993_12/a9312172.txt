Abstract    :
              9312180  Setterlind       Eckerd College requests support from NSF for
              connection of  their campus networks to SURAnet.  SURAnet is the midlevel 
              network located in the southeastern United States.  It will  provide operations
              management and information services and it  will give Eckerd College a 56
              thousand bits per second connection  to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45
              million bits per second)  National Backbone network.       The college has
              experienced a growth in auxiliary programs  that has added value to the basic
              mission that the college serves  to aid the education of all persons of all
              ages.  The networking  plan at Eckerd College is the foundation for uniting all
              the  disciplines and campus groups.  ***
