Abstract    :
              9312138  Coleman  This proposal concerns heavy Fermion physics. Four projects
              will be  considered: 1) Development of an odd frequency pairing model for 
              heavy Fermion superconductivity. 2) A critical test for quadrupolar 
              ground-state doublets in uranium heavy Fermion compounds. 3)  Computation of
              the optical conductivity and dynamic susceptibility  of Kondo insulators within
              an Anderson lattice model. 4)  Development of a theory for anisotropic spin
              pairing to model the  hidden itinerant order in URu2Si2.  %%%  This proposal is
              concerned with the behavior of electrons which  behave, with regards to their
              transport in a material, as if they  have large masses. This field has a rich
              history but recent  discoveries have highlighted fundamental difficulties in
              our  present understanding. For example, two newly discovered heavy  Fermion
              materials - UPd2Al3 and UNi2Al3 - have large magnetic  moments and exhibit
              superconductivity from the same magnetic  degrees of freedom. This causes
              problems for the present theory of  such materials. Also, recent anomalies
              observed in such properties  as the specific heat in the heavy fermion material
              URu2Si2 suggest  that there is a "hidden" variable in the theoretical
              description of  the system. Work such as this is at the forefront of what is 
              considered state-of-the-art in contemporary condensed matter  theory.  ***
