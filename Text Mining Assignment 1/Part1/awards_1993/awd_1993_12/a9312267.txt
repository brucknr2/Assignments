Abstract    :
              Professor James T. Hynes is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and  
              Computational Chemistry Program to continue his research in the theory of  
              chemical reactions in solution.  He is applying a combination of MD  
              simulations, quantum theory, and analytical theory to obtain insights   into
              the effects of solvation on the rates of chemical reactions.  A   number of new
              applications will be pursued including: 1) a treatment of   the ionization of
              simple acids such as HCl and acetic acid; 2) proton   transfers involving
              nitroalkanes and aryl nitroalkanes; 3) proton   transfers for hydrogen chloride
              at the ice-air interface, and for sulfur   dioxide at the air-water interface
              as a model for reactions involved in   ozone depletion and acid rain.  Hynes
              will also continue his longer term   project involving the ionization of
              t-butyl chloride in aqueous solvent.    Theories explaining the behavior of gas
              phase chemical reactions are now   quite predictive for small molecular
              species.  Although there is still   much work in progress regarding energy
              transfer which occurs during the   reactive collision process, most of the
              physics of the reactive encounter   is well understood.  However, by far the
              majority of reactions which are   of interest to chemists take place in the
              solution phase, and by far the   most important solvent is water.  The effect
              which the presence of   aqueous solvent has on a chemical reaction is much less
              well understood.    Hynes is applying a combination of theory and computer
              simulations to   determine the molecular nature of the solvent-solute
              interactions and   their effects on the rates of chemical reactions in
              solution.  He is also   applying these theoretical methods to studies of
              important environmental   problems such as acid rain and ozone depletion.
