Abstract    :
              9312067  Fenster       The central theme of the proposed research concerns 
              determining the type of gene action which is responsible for  genetic
              differences among populations of the common native  legume, Partridge Pea. 
              Genes may act independently of one  another so that genetic divergence may
              simply reflect the  accumulated effects of artificial or natural selection
              acting on  single genes.  However, it is just as likely that important 
              differences among organisms may reflect selection on combinations  of genes. 
              Selection acting on combination of genes means that  gene interaction or
              epistasis is important.  The type of gene  action can be determined by
              following the survivorship and  reproduction of progeny derived from crosses
              between parents that  are separated from one another by increasing distance.%%%
                    Results from this project using Partridge Pea as a model  system may have
              important implications for a number of different  disciplines including
              evolution, crop and animal breeding, and  conservation biology.  If organisms
              are adapted to their  environment because of interactions among genes, then our
              models  of evolution will need to be more complex.  In addition where  gene
              interactions occur different breeding strategies than those  presently employed
              may have greater efficacy for crop and animal  improvement.  Strategies for
              maintaining or preserving genetic  diversity in endangered species will also be
              influenced by  whether gene interaction determines traits associated with 
              survivorship, reproduction, or yield.***
