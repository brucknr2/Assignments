Abstract    :
              This award is to support a workshop designed to explore the                    
              potential participation of U.S. investigators, through the                     
              U.S. Antarctic Program, in the "Cape Roberts Project," a                       
              stratigraphic drilling project with target sites in the                        
              southwestern Ross Sea.  This project has developed and evolved                 
              through the course of meetings held both as international                      
              workshops and as less formal meetings in conjunction with                      
              other professional scientific meetings.  Other potential                       
              participants in this project are New Zealand, Italy, Germany,                  
              and Japan.  Scientific objectives for drilling include several                 
              problems in the paleobiogeography and glacial history of the                   
              Ross Sea and problems in the tectonic history of the Ross Sea                  
              region.  The workshop will be held at the Byrd Polar Research                  
              Center at The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, during                    
              spring of 1993.
