Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This program is to allow a young PI working in a spectral, finite-             
              element method applied to ocean modeling, to attend meetings as                
              well as to consult with experts, on how to make the model better               
              reflect reality, and more useful in studying ocean general                     
              circulation problems.  The application of the model the PI is                  
              working on, is to study ocean circulation and local heat transport             
              patterns, energy exhcange processes among different scales,                    
              mechanisms of mesoscale dynamical structures (like eddies and                  
              fronts) and their roles in maintaining the local and global ocean              
              climate.
