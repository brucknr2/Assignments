Abstract    :
              9312375  Olson    This U.S.-Eastern Europe workshop on "New Legislatures of
              Central Europe:  Institutionalization of the Democratic Transformation" is
              organized by Dr. David M. Olson  of the University of North Carolina,
              Greensboro, and Dr. Lubomir Brokl of the Institute of  Sociology of the Czech
              Academy of Sciences.  It will be held in Prague during August 1994  and will
              involve ten participants from the United States, ten from the Czech Republic
              and the  Slovak Republic and seven from other countries in Central Europe.  The
              workshop itself will  feature country papers as well as specialized sessions on
              methodological and topical matters.   The overall objective is to examine the
              course of development of parliament(s) as a whole  institution during the
              beginning phases of a new post-communist political system, with the  intent of
              understanding the legislatures' reciprocal interplay with the wider political
              system.   Results should point to new international cooperative research
              opportunities for future study  of the ways in which the institution of
              parliament(s) in Central Europe adapt(s) to the new  circumstances of
              democratization.    This workshop in political science fulfills the program
              objectives of advancing science by  enabling leading experts in the U. S. and
              Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents  and pool research resources in
              areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
