Abstract    :
              9312199  Asgill  This research will study a data-selective purely digital timing
              recovery scheme for OOK optical receiver.  The computation of the timing
              updates are made from the symbol-rate samples of the received signal.  The
              proposed Symbol-rate Sampling Technique (SST) offers the advantages of low
              hardware complexity and low timing jitter.  This is accomplished by determining
              the timing function estimates only when certain data patterns occur.  As such a
              ROM, containing the coefficients of the adaptive filter, can be used in a table
              look-up configuration.  Preliminary computer simulations have demonstrated the
              effectiveness of this technique, in particular its fast convergence rate.  The
              proposed research is expected to extend these preliminary results and study
              further the convergence behavior of the technique, the effect of receiver
              noise, fiber pulse spreading and data attributes on the system performance.
