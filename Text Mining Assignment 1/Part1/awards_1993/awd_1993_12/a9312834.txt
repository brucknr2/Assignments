Abstract    :
              9312834  Roark       The Chemistry Department of the University of Nebraska  at
              Kearney has a strong tradition of research experiences  for undergraduates.
              Several newly appointed faculty members  have a particular commitment to
              enlisting their  undergraduate students as collaborators in their research 
              programs. Unfortunately, the Chemistry Department's building  does not provide
              adequate facilities for research and  research training. To correct this
              problem, the university  administration will convert part of the general
              chemistry  laboratory space into facilities for faculty and student  research. 
                   Expanding the chemistry research facilities at the  University of Nebraska
              at Kearney will make several  significant contributions: 1) providing adequate 
              environments for research equipment, 2) enabling research by  recently hired
              young investigators, 3) promoting joint  student-faculty research projects, and
              4) attracting  undergraduate students to careers in science.  ***
