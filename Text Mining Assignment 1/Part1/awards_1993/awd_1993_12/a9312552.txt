                    h   #  REVIEW ANALYSIS    This proposal is for the "Self Sufficient
              Partnership for Research" Program at Carnegie Mellon University's
              Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Iron and Steelmaking
              Research.  Three reviewers reviewed this proposal and rated it "Very Good." 
              Two reviewers noted that a letter from the Industrial Advisory Board endorsing
              the Center should be received before this project is funded by the I/UCRC
              Program.  This letter has been provided by the P.I.  The Program Manager
              recommends this project be funded.
