Abstract    :
              9312543  Mochrie    The United States is building a "third generation"
              synchrotron x-  ray source with a total project cost in excess of $1 billion:
              The  Advanced Photon Source (APS) at Argonne National Laboratory.  At  the APS,
              one may expect an improvement in the source brilliance  by three-to-four orders
              of magnitude.  As a result, it will  become possible to pursue experiments
              using techniques completely  novel to the x-ray regime such as intensity
              fluctuation  spectroscopy.  In addition, current techniques, such as surface x-
               ray scattering, time-resolved scattering, and x-ray magnetic  scattering will
              be further refined to yield insight that is  beyond the scope of current
              sources.  It is essential that high  quality, NSF supported, university groups
              play a leadership role  in the research carried out at the APS most especially
              because of  the role that the facility can play in graduate education.   This 
              project will develop a beamline at the APS to carry out forefront  research in
              condensed matter physics and materials science.  The  scientific program
              involves: (a) intensity correlation  fluctuation using coherent x-rays; (b)
              scattering studies of  surface phase transformations, structure, kinetics and
              growth;  and (c) x-ray magnetic scattering studies of novel magnetic  systems,
              including disordered magnetic systems.  This beamline  will be shared by
              scientists from Massachusetts Institute of  Technology, IBM, and McGill
              University, and will be available to  other scientists, as well.    ***
