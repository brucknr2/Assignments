Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The objective of this program is to evaluate the potential of a                
              Russian instrument for determining the density of the sea water by             
              measuring the index of refraction.  The former Soviet Union has                
              invested in this research (the insitu measurement of the index of              
              refraction of the ocean and the use of this data) for more than 35             
              years.  One direct application is to determine the density of the              
              sea water as an alternative method to conductivity.  Results in                
              shallow waters are very encouraging.  A cooperative US/Russian                 
              effort will take place during which the appropriate Russian                    
              scientists will visit the US to describe and demonstrate their                 
              instrument and method.  Laboratory facilities will be provided at              
              the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute to prove their equipment and            
              test it jointly with US scientists.  It is expected than an                    
              accurate evaluation of the interferometer as well as the algorithm             
              used, will be done.  If satisfactory, the techniques will be                   
              improved and further developed in the US.
