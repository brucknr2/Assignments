Abstract    :
              9312621  Brown  The objective of this research is the development of a more 
              complete understanding of the dominant characteristics of  saline ice that can
              be used to describe the mechanical  behavior of saline ice relative to pure
              ice. This research  is a continuation of a previous National Science Foundation
               grant which showed an order of magnitude difference in the  material strength
              between saline ice and nonsaline ice  single crystals and smaller differences
              between  the moduli  and flow stresses. In the continuation of this research 
              several possible micro structural mechanisms will be  considered to explain
              these differences, to be combined into  a single constitutive equation for
              saline ice single  crystals. The importance of this work is based on the need 
              for a better understanding of microscopic cavities and the  role they play in
              the deformation of solid materials  ***
