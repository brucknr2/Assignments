Abstract    :
              1  9314212  Montonye    The 1994 symposium on Astronomical Telescopes &
              Instrumentation for  the 21st Century organized by SPIE -- The International
              Society for  Optical Engineering, will be held 13-18 March, 1994 at Kona, 
              Hawaii.  The Symposium, held every four years since 1966, is a  major event in
              astronomical hardware and technology.  It is  expected that the symposium will
              be attended by approximately 500  technical delegates from 15 different
              countries.  Conferences will  provide discussion on the dramatic changes in the
              design and  capabilities of large telescopes; examine the new developments of 
              the next generation of optical/infrared telescopes; and report on  the
              development of synthetic aperture telescopes built for the  spectral range from
              UV to submillimeter.  A new conference on  adaptive optics will report on new
              AO systems and components, and  serve as a forum for scientists and engineers
              working in the laser  beam control, astronomical imaging, electro-optical
              sensor, and  optomechanical component communities.  National Science Foundation
               funding would allow the participation of speakers active in the  fields of
              astronomical hardware and technology who need partial  support to attend and
              present results of their research.  ***
