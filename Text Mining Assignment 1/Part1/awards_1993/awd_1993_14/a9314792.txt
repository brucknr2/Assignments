Abstract    :
                9314792  Durney  The Babcock-Leighton theory of twenty years ago holds that
              the  migration of magnetic fields across the solar surface plays a key  role in
              the reversal of the solar magnetic field.  However, more  recently, the idea
              that the reversal has its origin at the base of  the solar convective zone has
              become widespread.  This implies that  the observed surface activity is
              irrelevant to this question.  A  study will be undertaken to establish whether
              the Babcock-Leighton  theory is in fact viable or should be abandoned.  ***
