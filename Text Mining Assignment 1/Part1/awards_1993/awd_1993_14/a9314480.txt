Abstract    :
              9314480  Rossby    An experimental study of Lagrangian potential Vorticity will
              be  conducted in the Gulf Stream for two distinct cases:  One, for  particles
              in the center of the Stream, to evaluate quantitatively  the hypothesis of a
              "frozen" velocity structure and, two for  particles that are entrained and
              expelled at the northern edge of  the Stream to study the conservation of
              potential vorticity.  Two  cruises to the Gulf Stream in late summer and in
              late winter will  take place.  During these cruises floats will be launched and
              CTD  and ADCP sections will be obtained.
