Abstract    :
              9314438  Moehle  The National Information Service for Earthquake Engineering 
              (NISEE) collects and organizes information on earthquake  engineering and
              allied fields and disseminates it to  practicing engineers and related
              professionals, students,  educators, researchers, government agencies, and the 
              general public.  The NISEE program at the Earthquake  Engineering Research
              Center, University of California at  Berkeley, achieves this purpose through
              the EERC Library,  Earthquake Engineering Abstracts database, the Abstract 
              Journal in Earthquake Engineering, computer software  distribution, and
              promotional activities.    During the last three-year grant cycle, the EERC
              library  converted all its bibliographic records to machine-readable  form and
              began to make its material available through  resource-sharing networks.  The
              NISEE database (renamed  Earthquake Engineering Abstracts) was expanded  to
              include current information in earthquake engineering.  In addition to
              maintaining availability through the Internet  and via modem connections, the
              database is now also  available to more users through the University of
              California  online catalog system, MELVYL.  The Computer Applications  group
              continued to distribute over 100 different  microcomputer and mainframe
              computer software packages.  Six  volumes of the Abstract Journal in Earthquake
              Engineering  were published, bringing the publication schedule up to  date.   
              This award provides renewed funding for NISEE at the  University of California
              at Berkeley.  Another branch of  NISEE is also being supported by NSF at the
              California  Institute of Technology.  ***
