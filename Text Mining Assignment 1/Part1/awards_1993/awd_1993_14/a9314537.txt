Abstract    :
              9314537  Tublitz    Neuropeptides, small proteinaceous molecules released from
              nerve  cells, have profound effects both on the brain and peripheral  tissues. 
              They have been implicated in a variety of neural  functions, ranging from
              controlling movements to transmitting  sensory information such as pain.  These
              chemicals are also  involved in more long-term behavioral changes such as
              learning and  memory, arousal and various emotional states.  Despite their  
              critical importance, little is known about the cellular and  molecular
              mechanisms underlying peptide action.  Dr. Tublitz's  research is directed
              towards finding these answers.  He is  concentrating on a family of
              neuropeptides, the Cardioacceleratory  Peptides (CAPs), that modulate several
              different tissues, including  the heart, gut and brain.  In his previous NSF
              research, Dr.  Tublitz demonstrated that these neuropeptides modulate four 
              different, developmentally-specific behaviors, each having a  distinctive set
              of characteristics resulting in very different  physiological and/or behavioral
              consequences.  Moreover, he  identified the cells that produce the CAPs and
              their targets.  Dr.  Tublitz will now determine how these neuropeptides affect
              their  targets at the molecular level as well as to identify the genes  that
              code producing the peptide regulate its levels.  The results  from this basic
              research will lead to a better understanding of how  neurochemicals function to
              modulate nerve cell activity and  subsequently, behavior.  ***
