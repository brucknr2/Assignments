Abstract    :
              9314813  Hole    This award supports a U.S.-France workshop on the analysis and 
              interpretation of the use of stone tools from the pre-pottery  neolithic period
              of the Near East (ca. 8500-6500 BC) to be held  in Jales, France, October,
              1994.  The organizers are Frank Hole  of Yale University, Marie-Louise Inizan
              and Marie-Claire Cauvin  of the Institute for Near East Prehistory in Jales,
              France.  This  period represents the initial spread and development of 
              agriculture and animal husbandry.  Many sites have been excavated  by many
              countries yet communication among researchers has been  difficult. The purpose
              of this workshop, one in a series between  30 archaeologists worldwide, is to
              coordinate efforts and  research, and to identify areas for future cooperation.
              This  U.S.-France group of 20 systematists and experimentalists will  analyze
              the manufacture and function of stone tools used during  the neolithic period. 
                Stone tools are abundant at pre-pottery neolithic sites in the  Near East. 
              Comparison of these implements is used traditionally  to assess the ages of the
              sites, activities, and cultural  relationships among the sites' inhabitants.
              This work will  contribute directly to the effort of understanding human
              activity  and culture from this crucial period.  ***
