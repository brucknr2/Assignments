Abstract    :
              9314763  Selby  This U.S.-Argentina Cooperative Science Program award will
              support the collaboration of Henry Selby of the University of Texas at Austin
              and Alejandro Isla of the National University of San Salvador de Jujuy in
              Argentina.  The project aims to collect information from middle and working
              classes in Argentina to determine how households have changed during economic
              crises of the 1980s, and compare this information to similar data collected in
              Mexico.    Argentina and Mexico are recuperating from these economic crises and
              have transformed their economic systems with generous dosages of neoliberalism.
               The researchers will explore whether changes in households have persisted into
              the present, and how household and kinship ideologies have been transformed as
              a result.  They will analyze various kinds of survey data from Argentina and
              Mexico in order to make comparisons.  Both the U.S. and the Argentine sides
              will benefit from this exploration of cultural analysis in Latin America, and
              from the training of graduate students through their research.  ***
