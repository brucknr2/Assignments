Abstract    :
              This award is the starter grant increment of Dr. Catalano's                    
              Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Chemistry. A new class of                  
              tri- and tetrametallic complexes will be synthesized containing                
              a multiple Group VI metal-metal bonded core bridged along the                  
              metal-metal axis by a bidentate ligand to one or more square                   
              planar transition metal complexes.  The goals of the research                  
              are to explore the bonding interactions between the square                     
              planar metal and the multiply bonded core and to probe the                     
              chemical and photochemical reactivity of these assemblies. The                 
              research will employ standard inorganic synthetic techniques                   
              using known precursors and the resulting products will be                      
              characterized by single crystal x-ray diffraction, multinuclear                
              NMR, absorbtion and emission spectroscopies and IR and Raman                   
              spectroscopy.                                                                  
              %%%                                                                            
              This research will lead to a fundamental understanding of the                  
              multiple metal-metal bond and its role in inorganic chemistry,                 
              photochemistry and catalysis.
