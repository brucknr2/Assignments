Abstract    :
              9314506  Morris        This study will use Be and b isotopes as tracers of the
              Sediment  input into active margin volcanism. Concentrations of 10-Be can be 
              compared between incoming (subducted) sediment and the volcanic,  and used to
              determine the proportions of sediment accreted,  subducted and recycled. The
              partitioning can then be used to  determine mass fluxes at margins, to be
              compared with estimates  derived from seismic imaging.
