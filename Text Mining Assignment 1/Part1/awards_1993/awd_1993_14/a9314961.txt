Abstract    :
              This project involves research on integrating the intentional and  informational
               perspectives in architectures  for  interpretation  and  generation  of 
              interactive discourse.  Particular  problems  investigated  include  the
              recognition by  the  listener  of  the  speaker's  plan, a formalization of the
              notion of "conversational  record," discourse structure from a computational
              point of  view,  and  analysis  of  implicatures involving  quantity  and 
              similar  phenomena   involving  interactions  between  the  processes   of 
              generation  and interpretation.  Bases for the research  are  the  use  of
              abductive inference in finite-state approximation methods  and  in 
              knowledge-based  systems,  accommodation  processes   in  interactive 
              discourse,  generation  of  coherent  text,  use  of  defeasible reasoning in
              plan recognition, and utterance  planning  to achieve communicative goals.
