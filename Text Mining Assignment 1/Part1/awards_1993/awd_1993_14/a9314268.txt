Abstract    :
              This project will produce current information on the                           
              demographic and employment characteristics of doctoral                         
              scientists, engineers, and humanists in the United States.                     
              To accomplish this, the National Academy of Sciences will                      
              conduct the 1993 Survey of Doctorate Recipients, develop a                     
              longitudinal file of information (the Doctorate Work History                   
              File), and prepare a variety of cross-tabulations from the                     
              1993 survey.  The survey response rate will be greatly                         
              enhanced by extensive use of computer assisted telephone                       
              interviews (CATI).                                                             
              The Foundation is responsible for developing and maintaining                   
              a data base of demographic, educational, and employment                        
              information on scientists and engineers.  This data base,                      
              the Scientific and Technical Personnel Data System, requires                   
              input from three survey series:  The National Survey of                        
              Natural and Social Scientists and Engineers, The Survey of                     
              Natural and Social Scientist and Engineering Graduates, and                    
              the Survey of Doctorate Recipients.  Data from the Survey of                   
              Doctorate Recipients are frequently used to determine the                      
              status of various aspects of U. S. science and engineering,                    
              e.g., changes in research and development activities, and                      
              are also used in conjunction with data from the other                          
              surveys for analytical and policy purposes.  Co-sponsoring                     
              agencies are the National Endowment for the Humanities,                        
              National Institutes of Health, and the Department of Energy.
