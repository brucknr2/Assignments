Abstract    :
              9314672  Buck    Continental margins where the crust is hot or was hot during
              the  extension do not always match simple lithospheric extension models.  The
              PI will use a two-dimensional model of thin brittle-plastic  crust overriding a
              thicker viscous lower crust to learn more about  controlling factors of
              long-term continental margin development in  South China Sea, Aegean Sea, the
              Woodlark basin and the Exmouth  Plateau.
