Abstract    :
              9314387  Li       The principal investigator will explore a new system of 
              traffic modeling and network control in high speed networks.  The  work will
              build a foundation for integrating traffic measurement  and queueing analysis. 
              The investigator will consider three stages  of traffic modeling.  He will 1)
              use advanced signal processing  techniques in traffic measurement to collect
              the traffic power  spectrum and distribution, 2) develop a programming approach
              for  constructing a single Markov chain to match optimally with the  power
              spectrum and distribution, and 3) evaluate the corresponding  queue length and
              loss rate performance in a finite-buffer overload-  controlled system.  The
              investigator will design a software package  to accomplish all of the
              three-stage computation tasks.       For the network control, the investigator
              will use each node  in a high speed network to take on-line measurements.  On a
              local  link level, such measurements will be used for congestion control, 
              input rate control and simplify greatly the design of network-wide  traffic
              flow control, dynamic routing, and call admission control.   On a link level,
              the investigator will introduce a simple effective  method for dynamic link
              capacity allocation based on the on-line  observation of filtered input traffic
              low in the network.  THe key  advantages of such a control scheme are the
              ability to improve the  network performance by controlling the low frequency
              traffic flow  and the simplicity of operation by overlooking the queuing
              process  at each node.  ***
