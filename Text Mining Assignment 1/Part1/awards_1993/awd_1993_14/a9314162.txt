Abstract    :
              Lenz  9314162       A team of six specialists, all of whom are now actively 
              involved in research on biodegradable polymers and plastics (four  from
              universities, one from industry and one from a federal  government research
              laboratory,) will conduct a ten-day, fact-  finding tour of university,
              government and industry laboratories  and institutes in Japan to determine the
              present state o, and  future plans for, research, development and applications
              of  biodegradable polymers and plastics in Japan.  Other possible  applications
              for such polymers will also be surveyed, including  water-soluble polymers,
              fibers, coatings, etc.  It is planned to  visit at least 20 different
              locations, after which an interpretive  report will be submitted to NSF and a
              workshop will be held at the  convenience of NSF.
