Abstract    :
              9314620  COWEN    A state-of-the-art, fully integrated analytical scanning
              electron  microscope will be purchased for high resolution imaging in 
              conjunction with rapid and versatile elemental chemical phase and  digital
              imaging microanalysis.  The school of Ocean and Earth  Science and Technology
              has added many new faculty in the last few  years which have placed
              increasingly sophisticated demands on our  current instrumentation.  The new
              analytical SEM system would  provide: 1. simultaneous optimal imaging and x-ray
              detection, 2.  superior secondary and back scattered electron high resolution 
              imaging, 3. very high beam stability, 4. advanced computer array  (fast
              processor, large storage capacity) for efficient data/image  collection,
              processing and storage, 5. excellent stage automation  for high volume particle
              field analysis. The instrument will  directly and immediately benefit the
              diverse NSF-sponsored research  programs active within the Departments
              Oceanography, and Geology  and Geophysics and the Hawaii Institute of
              Geophysics.
