Abstract    :
              This is a joint project between Brown and Rutgers to build a large  microphone
              array with associated processors for beam forming.   Applications are direction
              finding, echo cancellation, and speaker  differentiation in telconference
              systems, multimedia educational  systems, and large conference centers.  Groups
              of microphones share  microphone modules that perform A/D conversion and
              low-level  processing.  The microphone modules are linked over a high speed 
              serial network (possibly optical) to a multiprocessors signal  processing
              system for the higher level processing.  The resulting  system is being
              evaluated in an experimental teleconferencing  facility.
