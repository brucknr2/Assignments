Abstract    :
              9314708  CHAN    Lithium isotopic compositions of hydrothermally altered
              sediments  of DSDP site 477/477A, as well as high temperature vent fluids of 
              the Guaymas Basin, have determined to gain an understanding of Li  exchange
              during fluid-sediment interaction at this sediment-covered  spreading center. 
              Unaltered turbidite of the basin has a 6Li value  of -10 0/100, 5 to 7 0/100
              heavier than fresh oceanic basalts.   Contact metamorphism induced by a shallow
              sill intrusion results in  a decrease of Li content of the sediment and a
              lighter isotopic  value (- 8 0/100).  Below the sill, sediments altered by a
              deep-  seated hydrothermal system show strong depletions in Li, while  isotopic
              compositions vary greatly, ranging from -11 to +1 0/100.   The shift to lighter
              composition is the result of preferential  retention of the lighter isotope in
              recrystallized phases after  destruction of the primary minerals.  The
              complexity of the isotope  profile is attributed to inhomogeneity in mineral
              composition, the  tortuous pathway of fluids and the temperature effect on
              isotopic  fractionation.      The range of Li concentration and 6Li values for
              the vent fluids  sampled in 1982 and 1985 overlaps with that of the
              sediment-free  mid-ocean ridge systems.  The lack of a distinct expression of 
              sediment input is explained in terms of a flow-through system with  continuous
              water recharge.    Observations on the natural system agree well with the
              results of  a laboratory hydrothermal experiment.  The ready mobility of Li in 
              the sediment under elevated temperature and pressure conditions has  important
              implications for its hydrothermal flux at spreading  centers and Li cycling in
              subduction zones.
