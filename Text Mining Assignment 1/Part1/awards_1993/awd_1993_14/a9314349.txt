Abstract    :
              9314349  LUTHER    The concentration of trace metals in anoxic and sulfidic 
              environments is controlled by the precipitation of metal sulfide  phases as
              well as the complexation of the metals by sulfide and  other sulfur species. 
              Stability constants of a variety  of metals  of environmental significance with
              sulfide, thiosulfate and  polysulfides will be determined.  The constants will
              be obtained by  voltammetric methods using the peaks of the sulfur species
              and/or  the metal.  The research also requires titrations of the complexes 
              with acid and base to determine the number of protons attached to  the sulfur
              species. This work will build on initial work in  seawater which shows that
              iron (II) and sulfide form two complexes  which are Fe(SH)+ (log B=5.5) and
              Fe2(SH)3+ (log B= 11.1).  These   constants are orders of magnitude higher than
              constants evaluated  by linear free energy relationships.  In fact, Fe2(SH)3+
              was not  predicted by this or any experimental approach which uses sulfide  as
              a titrant.  Thus, Fe(II) solubility at anoxic interfaces and in  sulfidic
              environments can be enhanced over previous estimates.
