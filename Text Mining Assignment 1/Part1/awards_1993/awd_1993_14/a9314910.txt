Abstract    :
              9314910 Thompson           The University of Texas will operate the Research
              Vessel LONGHORN during 1993 as a general oceanographic vessel in support of NSF
              funded research projects. The R/V LONGHORN is a 103' research vessel
              constructed in 1971 and stretched to its present length in 1986. The vessel is 
              owned by the University of Texas and operates primarily in the Gulf of Mexico. 
                       This vessel is part of a fleet used by the National Science Foundation
              to support oceanographic research.  Most oceanographic research requires highly
              specialized equipment and extensive support from a ship's crew. An increasing
              number of research projects require equipment that must be permanently
              installed on a ship and for which the ship must be specifically designed. Such
              equipment also requires highly trained crew members for maintenance and
              operation. These vessels do not operate in the same manner as general cargo or
              fishing vessels, therefore, NSF supports the operation of a variety of ships
              specifically dedicated to oceanographic research. These vessels are operated by
              universities and institutions around the country.
