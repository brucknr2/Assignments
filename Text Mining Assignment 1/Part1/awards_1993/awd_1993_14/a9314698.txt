Abstract    :
              9314698  Tyson    Abundances and Kinematics of Stars in the Galactic Bulge and
              Role of Supernovae in the Evolution  of Dwarf Galaxies.    Dr. Tyson will use
              this Minority Research Initiation Planning Grant to explore the scientific
              fertility  of two lines of research: (1) Element abundances in and kinematics
              of classes of stars in the bulge  of our Galaxy; and (2) Star formation in
              dwarf galaxies.  By the end of the planning grant period,  Dr. Tyson expects to
              have selected one of the two areas for pursuit of a full-scale research
              program.                                  ===============
