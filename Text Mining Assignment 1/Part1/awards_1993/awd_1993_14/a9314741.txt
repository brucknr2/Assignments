Abstract    :
              9314741  Heathcock        The focus of this research is the continuation of a
              varied   program of total synthesis.  Among the projects are the use of  
              biomimetic routes to the Daphniphyllum alkaloids, the   development of
              synthetic approaches to the Lycopodium aklaloids   including magellanone,
              synthesis of the highly cytotoxic marine   natural product cephalostatin,
              preparation of the squalene   synthase inhibitor zaragozic acid and the
              synthesis of   severalusual polysulfide natural products.  %%%  With this
              renewal award, the Synthetic Organic Program will   support the research of Dr.
              Clayton H. Heathcock of the   Department of Chemistry at the University of
              California,   Berkeley.  Professor Heathcock will focus his work on synthetic  
              projects directed towards the preparation of interesting   natural products.
