Abstract    :
              9314576  Sutton    This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative
              research  in nuclear physics involving C. Sean Sutton and Howard W.  Nicholson
              of Mount Holyoke College and S. Jullian of the  University of Paris (Orsay) and
              others at CNRS laboratories in  Bordeaux, Caen and Strasbourg.   The U.S. group
              will join NEMO-3  (Neutrinoless Experiments with Molybdenum), a French, Russian
              and  Ukrainian ongoing collaboration in search of neutrinoless double  beta
              decay.  Neutrinos are considered a prime candidate for the  missing mass (dark
              matter) in the universe.  One way to probe  neutrinos is to search for double
              beta decay.  Using the next  generation of detectors in double beta decay, the
              U.S will  participate in the experiments in the Frejus tunnel under the  French
              Alps and in the data analysis in Paris.    The U.S. experimentalists have just
              completed an intensive search  for double beta decay in the isotope molybdenum.
               In this  collaboration, they will develop methods to purify the molybdenum 
              samples and study problems of identifying radioactive impurities  in the double
              beta decay source materials. The French bring their  considerable expertise in
              low background engineering and  extensive measurements on natural radioactivity
              content of these  materials.  The Russian and Ukrainian contribution consists
              of  large quantities of molybdenum with very low radioactivity which  is
              critical for the double beta decay experiments.  ***
