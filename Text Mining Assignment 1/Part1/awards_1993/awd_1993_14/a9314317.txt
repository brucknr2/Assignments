Abstract    :
              In this Accomplishment Based Renewal (ABR) proposal, the PI will  continue his
              modeling work on coastal flows, namely a study of the  circulation on the
              continental shelf and slope. A specific goal is  to develop the capability to
              support field experiments with  applications of a validated, high-resolution
              regional shelf-  circulation model. Process studies will concentrate on the
              nature  of the cross-shelf transport in wind-driven systems.
