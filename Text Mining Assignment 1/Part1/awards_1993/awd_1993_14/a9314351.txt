Abstract    :
              Targett  9314351      Polyphenolic compounds are known to act both feeding 
              deterrents and digestibility reducing substances in  terrestrial and marine
              systems.  In vitro examinations of  the mode of action of these compound have
              revealed that  their activity is dependent on the chemical environment 
              (including pH, redox potential, the presence of surfactants,  and the presence
              of polyphenol ocidases) in which they are  acting, as well as the structure and
              concentration of the  compounds.  Little work has been done examining the mode
              of  action of polyphenolics in vivo, particularly in the marine  environment.  
              To understand the basis of the patterns  responsible for the activity of marine
              polyphenolics, this  study proposes to examine temperate and tropical marine 
              systems in which selected combinations of plant  characteristics and herbivore
              gut characteristics are  simultaneously evaluated.    ***
