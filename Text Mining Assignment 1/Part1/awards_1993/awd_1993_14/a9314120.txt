Abstract    :
              9314120  Martin    In this study the investigators will study filament channels
              on the  sun.  The behavior of filaments and filament channels is intimately 
              tied to solar activity on the sun, particularly coronal mass  ejections. 
              Filament channels mark th eboundaries between large-  scale bipolar magnetic
              regions whose patterns of emergence,  migration, and polarity reveal important
              aspects of the solar  cycle.  The research includes the analysis of existing
              data, the  acquisition and analysis of new observations, and theoretical 
              studies.  Data from several U. S. solar observatories will be used  in the
              study. The observations will be interpreted using models of  filament formation
              and several workshops will be held to discuss  the results.  The primary goal
              is to increase our understanding of  the physical processes related to the
              development of filament  channels on the sun.  ***
