Abstract    :
                9314931  Bell    The P.I. will continue his program of research in the area of
               stellar evolution.  Theoretical calculations concerned with stellar 
              atmospheres, stellar interiors and nucleosynthesis will be made.   Observations
              of stars in globular star clusters and field stars,  including Cepheid variable
              stars, will be made for comparison with  the calculations.  The goals are to
              improve our understanding of  the properties of stars and how they evolve with
              time and to create  stellar spectral libraries needed to understand both the
              stellar  population of our galaxy and the evolution of galaxies.  ***
