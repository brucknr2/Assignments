Abstract    :
              9314798  Glynn         This research will continue a long-term study that has
              focused on ecological disturbances  to eastern Pacific coral reefs that
              accompanied the sever and historically unprecedented 1982-83  El Nino-Southern
              Oscillation (ENSO).  The study involves international collaboration with host- 
              county research teams and primary field sites in Costa Rica, Panama, and the
              Galapagos Islands  (Ecuador), areas heavily impacted by the 1982-83 ENSO.  Dr.
              Glynn will lead the research to  continue (a) with the physical and biotic
              monitoring of eastern Pacific coral reefs initiated in the  early-mid 1970s,
              (b) investigating the responses of different coral species to ENSO stressors,
              (c)  studying coral reproductive ecology as it relates to recruitment success,
              and (d) documenting  coral community recovery.  New research directions include
              (e) remote sensing, which will  attempt to link coral bleaching/mortality with
              local and global scale sea surface temperatures by  means of synoptic and
              repeated measurements, and (f) modeling of coral population and  community
              dynamics based on mechanistic relationships between temperature, predation,
              coral  growth, and survivorship derived from field monitoring and experimental
              results.       Because important secondary disturbances are still occurring and
              reef recovery has been  slow, it is necessary to continue this study in order
              to understand the variety of changes involved  and the full impact of a major
              disturbance on eastern Pacific coral survival and reef building.   We are
              hopeful that ENSO warming disturbances can provide some insight to the probable
               changes in coral reefs worldwide if projected global warming causes repeated
              and/or protracted  sea temperature increases comparable to the 1982-83 ENSO.
