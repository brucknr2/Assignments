Abstract    :
              9314129  Reiss    This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative
              research  in theoretical chemistry between Howard Reiss of the University  of
              California, Los Angeles and Pierre Schaaf of the Institut  Charles Sadron in
              Strasbourg, France.  The objective of their  research is to use newly developed
              methods of optical microscopy  to study the deposition and adsorption of
              colloid particles on  various surfaces, for example, melamine particles on
              silica  surfaces.  They plan experiments on particle deposition, kinetic 
              theory, the radial distribution function, and especially, the  fluctuation of
              particle density over surfaces.    The U.S. investigator brings to this project
              considerable  expertise in theoretical chemistry, especially in the area of 
              colloid particles.  This is complemented by the French  experimentalist who
              developed a method to measure fluctuation  density. They will be involved with
              theoretical aspects of the  project as well.  The deposition of particles and
              fluctuation of  particle density are of considerable importance in science and 
              technology, and of particular interest to the biochemistry field,  where the
              focus has been on the adsorption of proteins on  surfaces.  ***
