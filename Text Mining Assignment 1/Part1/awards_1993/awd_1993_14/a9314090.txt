Abstract    :
              9314090  O'Grady       This is a Small Grant for Exploratory Research in support
              of  the Intelligent Manufacturing Systems (IMS) Initiative.  In an 
              unprecedented world wide effort, numerous commercial organizations  and
              universities have joined together under the aegis of the IMS  test case for
              concurrent engineering to conduct a one year  feasibility study.  This grant
              provides partial support for a  student to work in this effort.       This
              support is important in that it provides student  involvement in a project that
              may be the forerunner of a new  paradigm for the way research is to be
              performed.
