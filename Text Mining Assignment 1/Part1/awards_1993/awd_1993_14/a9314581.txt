Abstract    :
                  9314581  Watts    The Synoptic Ocean Prediction Program (SYNOP) is a major
              observational and modeling program funded by NSF and ONR to understand the
              physics of the Gulf Stream and its variability east of Cap Hatteras to the
              Grand Banks. The PIs component of SYNOP consisted in two arrays of current
              meter moorings, inverted echo sounders and pressure sensors. The instruments
              were recovered during August 1990.  Based on the analysis of these data sets,
              12 articles were published, one MS and two PhD theses completed, and another
              will be completed during the Summer of 1993. This proposal request support for
              scientific analysis and publication of results based on data collected during
              SYNOP.      ***         @       CG^ CI^ CP^ CC^ CE^ CD^ CB^ CS^ CF^ CU^ CQ^ CK^
