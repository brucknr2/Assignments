Abstract    :
              9314347  Reed       This is a program of research including four inter-related 
              topics.  (1) decoding techniques and Grobner bases: a polynomial  point of view
              (2) decoding cyclic codes up to their true minimum  distance, (3) decoding
              algebraic geometry codes, and (4) simplified  decoding algorithms.  The
              decoding problem will be formulated in  terms of ideals, and relationships with
              the error locator  polynomial and Grobner bases will be sought.  Preliminary
              results  show that is is possible to construct algebraic decoding methods by 
              the use of Grobner bases to decode all cyclic codes up to the true  minimum
              distance in some special cases.  These techniques promise  to be useful as a
              means of decoding algebraic geometry codes.  Much  effort in complexity
              analysis will be needed here.  The overall  goal is to come up with a low
              complexity decoding algorithm that  corrects up to the true minimum distance.
