Abstract    :
              9314423  Benkovic    This two-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative
              research in  biochemistry between Stephen J. Benkovic and Jean-Pierre Mahy of 
              the University Rene Descartes, Paris, France.  The objective of  their research
              is to create catalytic antibodies, similar to  those found in hemeproteins,
              with the ability to induce an  immunological response to an appropriate hapten.
               A hapten is an  antigen that is incomplete and cannot by itself cause antibody
               formation.    The U.S. investigator brings to this collaboration expertise in 
              antibody induction, screening and selection of catalysts.  He  will focus on
              the mechanistic characterization of antibody  promoted reactions and produce a
              computer model of the antibody  structure.  This is complemented by the French
              investigator's  expertise in the synthesis, characterization and chemical 
              properties of porphyrin haptens.  The research will advance the  development of
              these catalytic antibodies and enhance  understanding of the influence of
              proteins on the catalytic  properties of "heme" - the iron component of
              hemoglobin.  ***
