Abstract    :
              This U.S.-Argentina Cooperative  Science Program award  supports  travel 
              expenses and some expendable research  supplies, related to the visit of Drs.
              S. Tabor and J.  Doring,  Florida State University  to Argentina. A graduate 
              student of the FSU group will accompany Dr. Tabor on his  second trip. The
              Argentine co-P.I. is Dr. Gerardo Garcia  Bermudez,  of the Comision Nacional de
              Energia Atomica.  Dr.  M. A. Cardona, of  the same institution ,will also 
              participate in the work.    The purpose of the proposed research is to perform 
              measurements of the lifetimes of isotopes of the nuclei of Y  and Se.  These
              lifetimes are in the picosecond range.  The  measurements will help to
              understand the transition between  single particle and collective motion, and
              the shape as well  as alternating patterns in  magnetic dipole strength of the 
              nuclei.
