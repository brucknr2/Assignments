Abstract    :
              Goss  9314174    This U.S.-Argentina Cooperative Science Program award will 
              support the continuing collaboration between astronomers  of the two countries:
               W. Miller Goss, of the Naional Radio  Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) and P.
              Frank Winkler, of  Middlebury College, VT from the U.S., and Gloria Dubner and 
              Elsa Giacani, of the Instituto Argentino de Radioastronomia,  from  Argentina. 
              The research will focus on imaging  Supernova Remnants -expanding shells of
              gas, left over after  a massive star explodes.  Images will be obtained with 
              radiotelescopes located both in the U.S. and in Argentina.    The project
              extends and builds on previous collaborative  research in the U.S., which began
              with a 1988 visit by Dubner  to the VLA.  Collaboration between the scientists
              involved  flourished since, and the present proposal extends this 
              collaboration through visits by Miller Goss and Winkler to  the Argentine
              institutions involved.  The project involves  two U.S. and one Argentine
              institution and graduate students  from both countries in international
              collaboration.  Both  the U.S. and Argentine sides contribute expertise to the 
              research, and telescope time for the project.  The  research is important and
              timely.
