Abstract    :
                9314929  Gary  The solar array at the Owens Valley Radio Observatory is
              uniquely  capable of mapping solar flares and active regions over the entire 
              microwave spectrum.  During the next year an additional antenna  will be added
              to the array which will further improve its  resolution.  The solar array will
              be used in connection with other  radio instruments, optical telescopes and
              satellites to study the  conditions in active regions on the Sun.  Progress is
              anticipated  in understanding the triggering, particle acceleration and energy 
              transport in solar flares as well as the coronal structure of  active regions.
