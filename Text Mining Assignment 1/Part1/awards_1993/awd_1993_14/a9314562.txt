Abstract    :
              9314562  McCarthy    The Problem of plastic pollution is an important issue in 
              environmental research.  Industry has been responding to this by  developing
              environmentally acceptable products which can replace  disposable plastic
              articles currently in use.  The use of  biodegradable polymers for this effort
              has been recognized by many  companies.  An Industry/University Cooperative
              Research Center for  Polymer Biodegradation at the University of Massachusetts,
              Lowell  would provide a better mechanism to stimulate industrial innovation  in
              the development of new technologies in degradable plastic  materials.  The
              Center will address research topics in the areas of  the microbial production
              of polymeric materials, organic  transformations, plastics processing, material
              characterization,  and environmental engineering.   The goal of this Center is
              to  develop suitable materials which are inherently degradable in  natural as
              well as being environmentally benign.    A number of companies have committed
              to support this effort.   Currently, there are six sponsors for the Center
              committing  approximately $300,000.    The Principle Investigator/Center
              Director and his colleagues have  demonstrated competency in their research
              performance in the  proposed area and have the knowledge and facilities to run
              this  Center.    The proposed research projects will address:  1)Microbial
              synthesis  of biopolymer; 2)design and chemical synthesis of biodegradable 
              polymeric materials; 3)graft and block copolymer synthesis; and 4) 
              modification on natural polymers.    The Industry/University Cooperative
              Research Center has been  coordinated with Dr. Robert Wellek, Deputy Division
              Director of  Chemical and Thermal Systems Division at the NSF.    The Program
              Manager recommends the University of Massachusetts,  Lowell be awarded $50,000
              for the first year of a five-year  continuing award.    Near the end of each
              12-month period the Program Manager and/or the  Division Director of the
              Engineering Education Centers Divisi on  will review the progress of the Center
              on a number of renewal  criteria requirements, including the following:  1) the
              extent to  which the university/industry interaction is developing; 2) the 
              extent to which the support base is developing; and 3) the extent  to which a
              robust research program is developing.  If the review is  satisfactory, the
              Program Manager will recommend support for the  next period of this continuing
              award.
