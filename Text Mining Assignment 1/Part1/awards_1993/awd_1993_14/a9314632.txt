Abstract    :
              9314632  Mottl       The PIs past participation on NOAA cruises at three 
              hydrothermal sites on basement highs on the eastern flank of JdF  (namely,
              FlankFlux `90,'92) led him to propose a model of how  hydrothermal processes
              operate at flanks of ridges.  In the  present project, the PI will go back with
              the ALVIN and make some  spatially fine-scale observations, measurements
              (heat-flow, water  column properties etc.),  and collect samples in order to 
              evaluate his current model.  The PI argues that past work on  ridge flank
              hydrothermal vents at a number of different sites  revealed that the
              hydrothermal processes and their effects are  diverse; and therefore,
              descriptive studies of the kind proposed  are necessary in order to determine
              global impact of ridge flank  hydrothermal circulation.       The site chosen
              is "JdF-3" which provides an unique  opportunity in having high sedimentation
              rate combined with high  basedment temperature  normally, such small diffuse
              hydrothermal  vents would be difficult to locate in unsedimented areas .  ***
