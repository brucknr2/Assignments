Abstract    :
              9314729 Dabrowski  This award supports a two-year cooperative research program
              between Professor Konrad Dabrowski, School of Natural Resources, Ohio State
              University, Columbus, Ohio, and Professor Katsumi Tsukamoto, Ocean Research
              Institute, University of Tokyo.  The objective of the joint research is to see
              whether ascorbic acid (vitamin C) affects the survival and performance of
              salmonoid fish.  Most of the studies will be done on an endemic Japanese
              species (ayu) that completes its life cycle in one year, and results with these
              fish will be compared to that of other species in the United States.  The
              results of these studies will be important in determining the role of ascorbic
              acid in endurance, protein utilization, and response to stress.  This
              information is of basic biological interest but is also of great importance to
              commercial fish hatcheries. ***
