Abstract    :
              9314326  Smith  The Center for High Resolution Electron Microscopy (CHREM) 
              provides state-of-the-art instrumentation and techniques for use  by the
              scientific community.  Research carried out by users of  CHREM involves
              detailed investigations of many types of  materials.  The CHREM facilities
              offers a variety of specialized  electron microscopes for use, in particular,
              two specialized  ultrahigh vacuum electron microscopes are available for
              tackling  key problems in surface science, thin film growth, and solid  state
              reactions.  The unique capabilities of the UHV electron  microscopes are of
              particular interest to those scientists who  pursue their ongoing research at
              high spatial resolution, and  electron microscopists who study surfaces under
              cleaner vacuum  conditions.  ***
