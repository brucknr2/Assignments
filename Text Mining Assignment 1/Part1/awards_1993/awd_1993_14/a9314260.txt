Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Iron plays a critical role in the maintenance of cell metabolism as            
              phytoplankton appear to regulate intracellular iron concentrations.            
              However, at present no one has conducted molecular studies on the              
              effects of iron deprivation on the genes that encode proteins of               
              photosystem II, Calvin cycle enzyme, and light harvesting                      
              chlorophyll.  This project will determine how chloroplast gene                 
              expression is regulated by iron (Fe++) in the eukaryotic marine                
              alga, Olisthodiscus luteus.  This alga, which is ecologically                  
              significant in toxic algal blooms yet essentially unstudied at the             
              molecular level, will serve as a model system to address critical              
              physiological and ecological questions in other marine algae.  The             
              work will provide critical information on how specific genes                   
              regulate these proteins at the transcription or post-transcription             
              level in response to iron as an environmental cue.  If successful,             
              future work will focus on factors that impose transcription control            
              or those that influence RNA stability and/or selective utilization             
              of specific RNA species.
