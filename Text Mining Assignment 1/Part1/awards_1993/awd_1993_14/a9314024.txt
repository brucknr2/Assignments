Abstract    :
              9314024  Graybill         There is widespread agreement on the scientific
              importance of  developing long, high resolution proxy records of climatic and 
              environmental variation in several recent assessments of directions  needed for
              global change research.  Tree-ring chronologies are  consistently referenced as
              one of the more important resources that  might be used for those purposes. 
              The great majority of  chronologies are however limited in temporal coverage to
              the last  300-400 years.   This award supports a workshop devoted to the 
              development of millennial aged tree-ring chronologies that will  provide new
              possibilities for investigating relatively long-term  climatic and
              environmental changes, i.e. during the past 2000-8000  years.  This kind of
              time depth will permit new information for  various regions on changes in the
              level as well as the variance of  climatic variables such as temperature and
              precipitation.  The  relative frequency of rapid or extreme climatic change
              events can  also be better estimated than was previously possible.         The
              full potential of these long chronologies is not yet  known.  These are new
              questions that have arisen and must be  considered before that potential can be
              realized.  One of these  concerns the most appropriate fashion for constructing
              long series  from overlapping chronology segments in order to preserve the 
              'true' variance structure of growth-driving environmental  variables.  Other
              concern whether the growth response to climate  has been constant over time,
              and if not, is this in turn related to  natural changes in stand structure or
              composition, to anthropogenic  activity, or to other factors yet unknown?
