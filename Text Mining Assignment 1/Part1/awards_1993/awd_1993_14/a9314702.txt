Abstract    :
              9314702  Maple  This award is for support of the "International Conference On 
              Strongly Correlated Electron Systems," to be held in La Jolla, CA,  on August
              16-19, 1993.  The funds will be used to provide travel  stipends for young
              scientists.  The conference, to be held at the  University of California at San
              Diego, is jointly sponsored by the  Los Alamos National Laboratory, the
              National High Magnetic Field  Laboratory, and the Institute for Pure and
              Applied Physical  Sciences.  The conference addresses a major research area in
              modern  condensed matter physics and materials science with topics ranging 
              from mixed valence systems to heavy fermions and high temperature 
              superconductivity.  NSF funding is being provided jointly by the  Condensed
              Matter Physics Program and the Materials Theory Program.  %%%  ***
