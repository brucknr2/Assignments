Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project is a workshop to highlight the High Performance                   
              Computing (HPC) National Challenge Applications in chemical,                   
              transport, and thermal systems.  The workshop will be held in                  
              Washington, DC on June 4, 1993.  The workshop will consist of                  
              five talks by academic researchers and an invited talk on HPC                  
              by an NSF representative.  The talks will provide a synopsis                   
              of HPC activity both present and future in their research                      
              areas.  The talks will focus on high performance computing in                  
              the areas of:  synthesis of electrorheological fluids;                         
              microstructure modeling of complex fluids; process synthesis,                  
              design, and optimization; and thermal effects in polymer                       
              processing technology.  This workshop will be held in                          
              Washington, DC, and the University of Wisconsin will handle                    
              travel costs of the participants.
