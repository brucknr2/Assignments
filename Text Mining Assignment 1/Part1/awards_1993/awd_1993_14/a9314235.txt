Abstract    :
              9314235  Taub    Technical abstract:  Neutron and x-ray scattering experiments
              on  adsorbed films are proposed to address a variety of problems of  current
              interest in surface physics:  1) determination of the  multilayer structure and
              growth mode of the simplest (rare gas)  films as well as that of more complex
              hydrocarbon films adsorbed on  solid substrates; 2) elucidation of the role of
              molecular steric  properties in the diffusive motion, growth kinetics, and
              phase  transitions of adsorbed films.  Experiments will be conducted at  the
              University of Missouri Research Reactor (neutron diffaction)  and at the
              National Synchrotron Light Source, Brookhaven (x-ray  diffraction).     
              Non-technical abstract:  A microscopic understanding of the  structure of
              organic films on metal surfaces is fundamental to the  technology of catalysis,
              lubrication, and adhesion.  Toward this  end, neutron and x-ray experiments are
              proposed to investigate the  layer-by-layer structure and growth of the
              simplest (rare gas)  films and then of more complex hydrocarbon films adsorbed
              on solid  surfaces.  Quasielastic neutron scattering will be analyzed to 
              determine the effect of molecular size and shape on the motion of  adsorbed
              hydrocarbon molecules.  Experiments will be conducted at  the University of
              Missouri Research Reactor and the National  Synchrotron Light Source.  ***
