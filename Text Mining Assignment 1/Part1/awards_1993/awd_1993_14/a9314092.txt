Abstract    :
              9314092  Kreisler       This group will continue to analyze the massive 
              quantities of data taken in runs at Brookhaven National  Laboratory and at
              Fermilab to study hadronic interactions in  which charm and strange particles
              are produced in  multiparticle final states.  An innovative use of fast on-line
               computational techniques and specially developed hardware  allowed trigger
              logic decisions to be made and data to be  recorded at extremely high rates. 
              Similar techniques are  applied to off-line reconstruction to prepare event
              samples  for analysis.  Topics of interest to the University of  Massachusetts
              group include Bose-Einstein correlations, hyperon  polarization, precision
              measurements of hyperon masses, and  meson-spectroscopy based on study of
              four-mesons states among  which evidence will be sought for "glueball"
              production.  ***
