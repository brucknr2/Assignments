Abstract    :
              931485194  Balachandran    This research planning grant will allow the PI to
              plan and begin a  research program directed at better understanding the role of
               rotation in the evolution of stars.  There is a body of evidence  which
              strongly suggests that the rotational history of a star plays  a significant
              role in determining its structure and surface  composition.  The goal of this
              project is to quantify the effects  of rotation by observing young, embedded
              pre-main sequence stars,  by measuring the abundance of lithium and rotational
              velocities for  stars in clusters of various ages and by measuring the CNO 
              abundances of stars in globular clusters.  ***
