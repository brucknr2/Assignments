Abstract    :
              9314567  Patterson    Our understanding of the orbital evolution, rotation,
              photometric  waves and emission line behavior in cataclysmic binary stars
              hinges  on observations of periodic variations in their brightnesses and 
              spectra.  Unfortunately, there has been little systematic effort  made to
              measure these periodicities and link the photometric  behavior with the
              spectroscopic behavior.  The PI will collaborate  with J. Thorstensen of
              Dartmouth College to address this  shortcoming.  The PI will obtain large
              amounts of photometric data  while Thorstensen will collect spectra for many
              cataclysmic  binaries.   ***
