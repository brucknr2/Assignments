Abstract    :
              9314074  Davis  In this project, the Principal Investigator will deploy
              mid-depth  floats referred to as ALACE (Autonomous LAgrangian Circulation 
              Explorer) floats at about 1000 meters depth in the Indian Ocean as  part of the
              Indian Ocean Expedition for the World Ocean Circulation  Experiment (WOCE). 
              These floats surface about every 25 days, to  report position and, in the case
              of 120 of them, a temperature  profile.  This proposal is part of the WOCE
              program to map the  multi-year average absolute velocity on a single level over
              the  entire world's ocean.  ***
