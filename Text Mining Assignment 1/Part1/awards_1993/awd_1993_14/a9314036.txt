Abstract    :
              Buskey  9314036    This study will examine the effects of food quantity and 
              quality on the growth, feeding and bioluminescence of  several species of
              Protoperidinium.  Selective feeding of  these pallium, feeding dinoflagellates
              (which capture large  food particles extracellualarly) and the role of sensory 
              perception in this selection  process will also be examined.  In addition, the
              study will determine the abundance of  heterotrophic dinoflagellates in the
              western Gulf of Mexico,  and examine the relationship between growth rate and 
              bioluminescence capacity for field collected Protoperidinium  incubated at
              ambient food concentrations.    ***
