Abstract    :
              9314451 Le Quesne  Description:  This project supports the participation by a
              group of U.S. scientists in the 19th International Union of Pure and Applied
              Chemistry (IUPAC) Symposium on the Chemistry of Natural Products, scheduled to
              be held January 16 to 20, 1994 in Karachi, Pakistan.  The Pakistani organizer
              is Dr. Atta ur Rahman, director of the H.E.J. Research Institute of Chemistry
              at the University of Karachi.  The symposium and a Pakistan U.S. Workshop will
              deal with frontier areas of natural product chemistry including stereoselective
              synthesis, modern spectroscopic techniques for structure elucidation, bioactive
              natural products and bioorganic chemistry.  The program will consist of plenary
              lectures, session lectures and poster presentations.  The sessions will be
              divided into four parallel sessions covering: synthetic approaches to natural
              products, bioactive natural products, structural studies on natural products,
              and bioorganic chemistry.  Scope:  This is the first IUPAC organized symposium
              to be held in Pakistan.  The H.E.J. Research Institute of Chemistry has
              organized several past symposia on natural product chemistry, with
              participation by eminent scientists from around the world, and with high
              quality publications resulting from these meetings.  The project will be
              beneficial to U.S. and to Pakistan scientists but also to participants from
              countries in South Asia and the Middle East which are usually represented.  A
              pre IUPAC symposium will be held in Colombo, Sri Lanka, and a post IUPAC will
              be held in Amman, Jordan.  The project will help many of the scientists in
              these countries to establish contacts with scientists from the U.S. for fut ure
              collaboration. ***
