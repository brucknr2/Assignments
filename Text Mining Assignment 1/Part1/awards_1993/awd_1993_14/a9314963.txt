Abstract    :
              9314963  Boggess       This is a standard award in the NSF/ARPA Human Language 
              Technology  for cooperative research involving Mississippi State  University
              and the Chemical Abstracts Service of the American  Chemical Society for the
              purpose of investigating means of  partially automating the indexing process of
              scientific text.  The  system assists the rapid determination of the key topics
              and  contents of scientific articles in a specified domain and in the 
              production of key phrases describing the content.  The domain,  which is the
              literature used in the Chemical Abstracts Service, is  analyzed making use of
              the uniform standards set for abstracting,  the well-understood terms and
              concepts applied to manual indexing,  and the hierarchy of concepts already
              established within that  domain.  Software used at Chemical Abstracts Service
              and the KUDZU  system - a knowledge-based natural language processing system -
              are  modified, extended and applied to the task of indexing articles in  the
              field of physical chemistry, with the goal of better than 80%  success rate. 
              The systems also highlights all relevant material in  an article being indexed
              in a manner which aids a human document  analyst to verify the correctness of
              the automatically produced  index phrases and to enhance the rapid correction
              of any erroneous  or omitted index phrases.
