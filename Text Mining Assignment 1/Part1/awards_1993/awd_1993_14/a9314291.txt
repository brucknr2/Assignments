Abstract    :
              9314291  DELANEY    Resources are being provided for one-half the cost of the 
              acquisition, installation, and initial operation of an inductively  coupled
              plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) with sample introduction  systems required by
              UCSC analytical needs.  UCSC is providing the  other half of these costs.  This
              instrumentation is not currently  available at UCSC. The majority of the funds
              requested are for  instrumentation costs. The instrument will be housed in
              dedicated  laboratory space which was specifically designed for an ICP-MS in 
              the institute of Marine Sciences Marine Analytical Laboratory   (IMS-MAL) in
              the new Earth and Marine Sciences Building that is  scheduled for occupancy by
              September 1993.  The instrument will be  used primarily by the PI's, with
              research interests including minor  and trace elements in biogenic and
              diagenetic marine carbonates and  interstitial fluids, marine biogeochemistry
              of trace elements in  the water column, marine biogeochemistry of trace
              elements and  their isotopes in marine, estuarine, and fresh water systems,
              trace  elements in continental lithosphere.  It will be available to other 
              users, as are existing facilities in Earth Sciences and Marine  Sciences and
              Marine Sciences at UCSC.
