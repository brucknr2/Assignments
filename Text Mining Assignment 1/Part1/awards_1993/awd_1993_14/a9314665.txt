Abstract    :
                9314665  Tonry    The objective of this project is the performance upgrade of
              the 2.4  meter MIT-Dartmouth-MIchigan telescope by implementation of a 
              relatively inexpensive active optical system.    The project will develop an
              active air-bag support for the primary  mirror to control gravity induced
              distortion as well as existing  problems with the mirror support.  The new
              support will permit  small corrections to the wavefront. A wavefront sensor
              will also be  developed using a state-of-the-art CCD from MIT Lincoln 
              laboratories.  The bandwidth of the wavefront sensor, ~100 Hz, will  permit
              later upgrade of the system with an adaptive mirror.  In the  present system it
              will provide the control system for 2-5 Hz image  motion compensation.   
              Working with MIT Lincoln Laboratory the project will also develop  a novel CCD
              for image motion compensation at the focal plane.    The significance of this
              project is its approach to a relatively  low cost performance upgrade of medium
              size telescope.  The  techniques developed should be applicable to a large
              number of  telescopes.  ***
