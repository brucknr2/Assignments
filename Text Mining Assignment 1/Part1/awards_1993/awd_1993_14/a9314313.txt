Abstract    :
              9314313  Witten  This award will partially support participation junior 
              researchers and postdocs in the First World Congress on  Computational
              Medicine, Public Health and Biotechnology, to be  held in Austin, Texas, April
              24-28.  This congress is being  organized by the Center for High Performance
              Computing at the  University of Texas.  The objective of this conference is to 
              bring together a transdisciplinary group of both junior and  senior researchers
              in the field of computational biology and  medicine to present their work.  The
              performance of current high  performance computing systems allows researchers
              to begin to  model biological complexity with more realistic models.    ***
