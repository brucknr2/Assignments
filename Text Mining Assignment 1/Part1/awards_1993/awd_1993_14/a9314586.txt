Abstract    :
              9314586  Eberli    This award will support a high-resolution multichannel
              seismic  survey across the western margin of Great Bahama Bank  and 
              correlation of this data with newly available industry-collected  data in the
              deep water regions surrounding Bahamas Bank. The  primary objective is to
              determine the three dimensional anatomy of  the sedimentary sequences and to
              develop a comprehensive sequence  stratigraphic model for this carbonate
              sedimentation system. Ground  truth will be provided by two boreholes
              positioned on the shallow  portions of the bank, and additional drilling which
              has been  proposed to the Ocean Drilling Program in the off-bank regions.  Data
              from the present project will be used in siting the ODP holes.  Data
              acquisition will be undertaken from the R.V. Lone Star which  is operated by
              Rice University.  ***
