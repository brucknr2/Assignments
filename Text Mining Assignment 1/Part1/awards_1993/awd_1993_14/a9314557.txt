Abstract    :
              Equipment for the HERMES experiment at the DESY laboratory  in Hamburg, Germany
              will be constructed.  This experiment  will provide new and precise information
              on the spin  structure of the nucleon at the quark-gluon level.  Polarized gas
              targets of hydrogen, deuterium, and 3He will  be used in the polarized beam
              stored in the HERA electron  storage ring.  The equipment will be built by
              groups based  at Caltech, the University of Wisconsin, and the University  of
              Illinois.  ***
