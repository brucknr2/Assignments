Abstract    :
              9314447  Olson    In this project, the PIs will deploy approximately 210
              Lagrangian  surface drifters in the Indian Ocean as part of the Indian Ocean 
              Expedition (IOE), a U.S. component of the World Ocean Circulation  Experiment
              (WOCE).  Drifters provide both surface currents and  surface temperature
              measurements.  In addition to contributing to  measuring temperature
              measurements.  In addition to contributing to  measuring near-surface
              variability during the IOE, these data will  fill a major gap in providing a
              surface layer data set of  Lagrangian current measurements over the entire
              globe during WOCE,  a major objective of that program.  ***
