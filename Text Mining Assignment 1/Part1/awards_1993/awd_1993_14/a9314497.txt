Abstract    :
              9314497  Gouldin    This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative
              research  in combustion and thermal physics among research groups at  Cornell
              University, the French National Center for Scientific  Research (CNRS)
              laboratories at Orleans and Poitiers, and  Cambridge University, United
              Kingdom.  The project leaders are  Frederick C. Gouldin, Cornell, and Iskender
              Gokalp, CNRS/Orleans.   The objective of their research is to improve
              combustion models  for premixed turbulent combustion systems.  The
              collaboration  brings together experimentalists at Cornell and Orleans with 
              theoreticians at Poitiers and Cambridge University.  The project  takes
              advantage of new methods for making critical measurements  of important
              properties of premixed turbulent flames developed by  the U.S. and French
              researchers.  This data will be used for  model validation and refinement in
              cooperation with the modelers  at Poitiers and Cambridge.    Premixed turbulent
              combustion is of considerable practical  importance, and premixed combustion
              systems account for a  significant fraction of fossil fuel consumption
              worldwide.  This  project will lead to new models for premixed turbulent
              combustion  which in turn can assist in the design of efficient, low-emission 
              combustors.  ***
