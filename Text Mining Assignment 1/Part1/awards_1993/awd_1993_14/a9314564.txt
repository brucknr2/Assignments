Abstract    :
              9314564  Kadko    The author proposes to test the hypothesis that an increase in
              3-  He/heat, following a megaplume event, reflects rapid degassing of  a
              newly-permeable system, after which conditions should return to  equilibrium
              with gradual precipitation of minerals and longer  residence time of waters. 
              He will use radioisotope tracers in vent  fluids to be collected at the
              northern Cleft Segment of Juan de  Fuca Ridge, which will be compared with data
              from 1990.  There will  also be a test deployment of a gamma detector to be
              used as a  monitoring device.
