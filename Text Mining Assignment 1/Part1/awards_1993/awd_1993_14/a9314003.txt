Abstract    :
              9314003  Cunningham  The Pennsylvania College of Technology and Lycoming College
               request support from NSF for a multicampus connection of their  campus
              networks to PREPnet.  PREPnet is the midlevel network  located in the state of
              Pennsylvania.  PREPnet will provide  operations management and information
              services and it will give  the colleges s connection to the NSFNET, a high
              speed (1.5 - 45  million bits per second) National Backbone network.    The
              colleges need greater functionality and network speed to be  able to access
              supercomputers, libraries, and make file transfers  along with being able to
              implement a more reliable mail system.  Students and faculty research will
              benefit from the links.  This  is also a unique opportunity for the schools to
              explore  innovative educational resources.
