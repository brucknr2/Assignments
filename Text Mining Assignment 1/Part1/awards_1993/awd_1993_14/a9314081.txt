Abstract    :
              A recurrent theme in community ecology is that interspecific competition greatly
              influences the distributions and abundances of vertebrate species in
              communities, and that such competition can lead to extinctions of populations.
              Terrestrial salamanders have been extensively studies to test theories about
              competition, and interspecific competition appears to be intense among many
              species. In eastern North America, widely distributed and abundant species
              appear to be strong competitors. Weaker competitors appear to have limited
              distributions and many such species are listed as threatened or endangered.
              This research will examine the possibility of competitive interactions
              (particularly interspecific territoriality) between seven species pairs of
              terrestrial salamanders. Experiments in natural habitats will test hypotheses
              about intra- and interspecific competition for space, and competitive release
              experiments will test hypotheses concerning the intensity of competition.
              Laboratory experiments will test hypotheses about intra- and interspecific
              combat tactics during aggressive encounters, pheromonal communication, and
              capturing of food resources.  %%%  In the eastern US, one widely distributed
              species interfaces with three geographically isolated species. The three
              isolated species are considered to be extinction prone as a consequence of
              severe interspecific competition for territories from the widely distributed
              species. This research will provide valuable field and laboratory experiments
              that will provide vital evidence regarding factors leading to the frequently
              observed population decline of amphibians, in general, and several species a
              salamanders, in particular.
