Abstract    :
              9314913  Steimle    This award supports a two-year cooperative  research project
              between Professor Timothy  Steimle, Department of Chemistry and  Biochemistry,
              Arizona State University, and  Professor Shuji Saito, Institute for Molecular 
              Science, Okazaki National Research Institutes,  Okazaki, Japan.  In addition,
              two graduate  students from Arizona State University and  several scientists
              from Tokyo University and  Shizuoka University will participate in the 
              project.    This collaborative effort is motivated by both  practical and
              fundamental scientific interests.   Transient metal containing compounds are 
              important elements in processes such as rf-  induced chemical etching and
              chemical vapor  deposition.  The proposed millimeter wave and  optical
              spectroscopic detection schemes will be  sensitive, non-invasive means of
              monitoring and  controlling the chemistry of such systems.  In  addition, there
              are many fundamental scientific  problems associated with metal containing 
              radicals, not the least of which is their  electronic and structural
              characterization  (i.e. bond lengths and angles, electronic state 
              distribution, m.o. description, etc.)    The U.S. and Japanese teams have
              complementary  theoretical and experimental expertise.  The  scientists at
              Okazaki have diode laser  spectroscopic capabilities; the Tokyo  University
              scientists have Fourier transform  microwave capabilities, and the Shizuoka 
              University group has millimeter wave  capabilities.  Cw-dye laser optical 
              spectroscopy and pump/probe microwave optical  double resonances of molecular
              beam samples  will be performed at Arizona State University.  ***
