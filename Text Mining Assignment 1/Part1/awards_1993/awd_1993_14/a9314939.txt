Abstract    :
              9314939  Patel    This award supports the participation of 12  U.S. scientists
              in a U.S.-Japan Seminar on  Mitochondrial Alpha-Keto Acid Dehydrogenase 
              Complexes, scheduled for August 1994 at Jichi  Medical School, Tochigi, Japan. 
              The co-  organizers are Professor Mulchand Patel,  Department of Biochemistry,
              State University of  New York at Buffalo, and Professor Yasuo  Kagawa,
              Department of Biochemistry, Jichi  Medical School.  Included among the U.S. 
              participants are several postdoctoral fellows  and graduate students.    Since
              the last international meeting on this  subject in 1988, there have been many
              important  developments in various aspects of the  structure-function
              relationship of component  proteins, the characterization of the genes,  and
              their involvement in several inherited  metabolic diseases.  The objective of
              the  seminar is to bring together leading U.S. and  Japanese scientists who
              have been responsible  for much of the recent development to discuss  current
              investigations of the structure,  function, regulation, and genetic aspects of 
              the alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complexes.   It is anticipated that this
              meeting will set  the stage for future research and enhance  collaborative
              research among scientists from  the two countries.  ***
