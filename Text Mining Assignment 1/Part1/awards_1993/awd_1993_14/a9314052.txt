              9314052 Zielinski  Description:  This project supports participation of the
              P.I., Dr. Gregory Zielinski, of the University of New Hampshire, and a U.S.
              graduate student in a research project with the Nepalese Department of
              Hydrology and Meteorology.  The research is aimed at gathering information on
              the extent of glacial deposits in the Chhonbarden Glacier valley of the eastern
              Dhaulagiri Himal and to establish a relative chronology of glaciation in that
              valley and the adjacent Hidden Valley Region.  The results are expected to
              provide baseline data for future research to develop a detailed regional
              chronology of glaciation in this area of Nepal for comparison with other
              proposed ice core/snow studies and tree ring studies by other investigators in
              the United States.  Evaluation of the weathering characteristics of clasts on
              moraines, soil development, and lichenometric techniques will be used to
              develop the record.  Scope:  This research project meets the objectives of the
              international collaboration with developing countries.  It provides an
              opportunity to a young U.S. scientist to start a cooperative activity with a
              foreign country where both sides will benefit from the interaction.  The
              proposed research also fits with a broad research being conducted by U.S.
              scientists in various areas of the world, especially in the North Arctic Region
              to learn about weather conditions during the period of formation of existing
              glacial deposits. ***
