Abstract    :
              9314610  Glibert  This US-Brazil Cooperative Science award will support the 
              collaboration of Patricia Glibert of the University of Maryland  and Patricia
              Metzler, a Ph.D. student at the University of Sao  Paulo, Brazil.  The project
              aims to measure planktonic nitrogen  transformations off the coast of Brazil.  
               The importance of nitrogenous nutrients in marine primary  production has long
              been recognized.  Their regeneration is known  to be a major source of nitrogen
              for oceanic primary producers,  but it is the rate of supply of "new" nitrogen
              which ultimately  determines the amount of production.  There have been
              virtually  no direct measurements of the rates of nitrogen transformation in 
              the western South Atlantic.  In this project, the researchers  will apply 15N
              stable isotope tracer techniques to investigate  physiological and
              trophodynamic responses to nitrogen fluxes in  Brazil's coastal and offshore
              waters.  The experiments will  elucidate the relationship between size- and
              time-dependent  responses by plankton to new nitrogen inputs and the dependence
               on new versus regenerated nitrogen.  These studies will benefit  both sides by
              producing data for an undersampled part of the  world's oceans, establishing a
              new area of research in Brazil,  and training a Brazilian student in
              methodology for these  experiments.  ***
