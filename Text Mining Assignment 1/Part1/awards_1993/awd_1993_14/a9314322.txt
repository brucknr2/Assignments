Abstract    :
              This  U.S. - Brazil  Cooperative Science Program  award  supports travel
              expenses and  expendable research supplies  and services  related to the visits
              of  Drs. R. Charudattan  and D. Habeck, U of  Florida, Gainesville,  to  Brazil
              .  The purpose of the visits is to  perform research on  biocontrol  of  weeds 
              occurring commonly  in the U.S. and  Brazil.    Conventional weed control
              relies on chemical herbicides,  which are costly and may cause damage to the
              environment.  Biocontrol is an alternative, environmentally safe way of 
              controlling weed and insect populations, which may result in  large cost
              savings.   The role of  insects and  pathogens  of biological origin  in
              controlling sicklepod,  and purple  and yellow nutsedge,  three weeds that
              occur in  agroecosystems, and waterhyacinth, Brazilian peppertree and 
              melaleuca, three weeds that  occur  in aquatic ecosystems,  will be researched.
                Since these weeds are widespread in  both Brazil and the U.S., both sides
              will benefit from the  collaboration.
