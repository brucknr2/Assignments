Abstract    :
              9314877  Ferbel       This grant is for partial support of the 1994 Advanced
              Study  Institute on Techniques and Concepts of High Energy Physics, the  latest
              in a series of successful biennial institutes that date  back to 1980.  The
              purpose of the institute is to provide  instruction on advanced technology in
              particle-physics  experiments to a select group of young physicists at the
              level of  recent Ph.D.'s or advanced Ph.D. students.  The award covers  their
              travel and incidental expenses in part.  ***
