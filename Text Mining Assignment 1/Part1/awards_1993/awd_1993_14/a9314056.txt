Abstract    :
              9314056  Amer       Motivated in particular by multimedia applications, a
              Partial  Order Connection (POC) service/protocol is proposed for end-to-end 
              communication.  Unlike classic transport services that deliver  objects either
              in the exact order transmitted or according to no  particular order, POC
              provides a service that requires some, but  not all objects to be received in
              the order transmitted.  Two  versions of POC are proposed: reliable, which
              requires that all  transmitted objects are eventually delivered, and
              unreliable, which  permits the service to control the loss of a subset of the
              objects.   In the unreliable version, objects are more finely categorized into 
              one of three reliability classes depending on their temporal value.   Further
              understanding of POC is accomplished by using Estelle (ISO  Standard 9074) and
              Estelle development tools to formally specify a  protocol that provides POC
              service.  The expected performance gains  of a POC service will be studied both
              analytically and with an  OPNET simulation.  To be studied are the expected 
              memory/bandwidth/delay performance improvements using POC when  compared with
              an ordered service for various combinations of: (1)  different partial orders
              and loss tolerances, (2) different  distributions of disorder and loss supplied
              by the underlying  service and (3) different sized sender-receiver buffers.
