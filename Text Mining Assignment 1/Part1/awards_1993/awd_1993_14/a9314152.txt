              Since World War II, research universities in the U.S. have achieved world
              premier status in basic research.  During the last decade, these universities
              have been under pressure to contribute to the Nation's economic development. 
              In particular, they have been asked to translate the results of new scientific
              advances into technologies that provide economic benefit.  This project is
              intended to examine the degree to which universities are making the shift in
              their research orientation and to identify the structural and environmental
              factors that are associated with, and affect, the accompanying cultural change.
               If a basic shift in the university research climate is in progress, it will
              have some important implications for the nation's technology transfer strategy.
               Such a shift implies that research universities may be better poised than is
              generally assumed to play a larger role in the development and deployment of
              technological innovations.  Equally important, the results of this study will
              add a new dimension of knowledge in a search for the ever evolving role of
              research universities in contemporary American society.  To test this cultural
              change and related hypotheses, the proposer intends to:  (1) survey a variety
              of respondents, including department chairs and members of their departments,
              research center and institute directors, vice presidents for research, and
              intel lectual property managers; and (2) conduct field interviews to develop
              case studies of five institutions that emerge from the survey phase as having
              shifted their research orientation notably more or notably less than others in
              the survey.  Fourteen independent variables will be studied, including regional
              differences, land grant status, academic disciplines, and amount of state
              research support.
