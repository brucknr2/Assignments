Abstract    :
              9314148  Heegard       The workshop brings together specialists in coding,
              system  theory, and symbolic dynamics.  Recent results have shown how  concepts
              in the three fields are quite closely related.  Each field  has its own
              language and viewpoint, which has posed barriers to  sharing results and
              concepts.  The purposes of this workshop are to  promote communication among
              researchers in each of these three  areas and to present cutting-edge research
              problems in each field  with the hope that cross-fertilization will promote
              progress.  The workshop will be held October 18-20, 1993 in Mansfield 
              Massachusetts.  The organizing committee includes David Forney, 
              Motorola/Codex; Chris Heegard, Cornell University; Brian Marcus,  IBM Almaden
              Research Center; and Mitchell Trott, MIT.  ***
