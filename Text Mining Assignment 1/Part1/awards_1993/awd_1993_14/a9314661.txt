Abstract    :
              9314661  Glyde    This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative
              research  in materials theory between Henry R. Glyde, University of  Delaware,
              and Henri Godfrin, ILL (Institut Laue Langevin),  Grenoble, France.  The
              project also involves participation of a  group at NIST (National Institute for
              Standards and Technology)  and researchers at the Rutherford Appleton
              Laboratory in the  United Kingdom.  Their research takes advantage of unique
              neutron  scattering facilities at ILL and the Rutherford Appleton  Laboratory
              to determine the neutron structure factors in liquid  helium Fermionic and
              Bosonic systems.    The U.S. investigators bring to this collaboration
              theoretical  expertise in liquid helium.  This is complemented by the French 
              group's experimental work.  Other measurements will be  accomplished through
              the collaboration with UK researchers and  through interaction with NIST which
              is now involved in quantum  fluids in disordered and confined geometries.  ***
