Abstract    :
                9314803  Goode  A long-standing international collaboration with W.
              Dziembowski of  the Nicolaus Copernicus Astronomical Center will be continued. 
              The  interior properties of stars will be determined by seismic studies.   
              Existing data for the Sun will be analyzed using improved methods  to probe the
              solar core.  The interiors of variable stars of the  Beta  Cephei and Delta
              Scuti classes will be studied by similar means.   The  results of this study
              will have ramifications to our understanding  of the physical processes which
              operate within stars and the  evolution of the Sun and other stars.  ***
