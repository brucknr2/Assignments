Abstract    :
              9314473  Kutzko    This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative
              research  in algebra and number theory between Philip C. Kutzko, University  of
              Iowa, and Guy Henniart, University of Paris, Orsay.  The  investigators will
              study a number of problems related to  representation theory of p-adic groups
              and applications to  Langlands' program.  The Langlands' picture theorizes that
               fundamental objects of arithmetic (elliptic curves) are connected  with
              fundamental objects in representation theory (classical  modular forms).  The
              U.S.investigator brings to this  collaboration expertise in the representation
              theory of p-adic  groups.  This is complemented by the French investigators
              renown  expertise in local Langlands conjecture.    This project will advance
              our understanding of representation  theory and will serve as a basis for
              future advances in number  theory and arithmetical algebraic geometry.  ***
