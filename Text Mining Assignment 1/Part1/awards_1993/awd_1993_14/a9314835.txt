Abstract    :
              9314835  Haugan    This award supports a 12-month Science and  Technology
              Postdoctoral Fellowship for Dr.  Timothy Haugan, Department of Electrical and 
              Computer Engineering, State University of New  York Buffalo, at the
              International  Superconductivity Technology Center,  Superconductivity Research
              Laboratory, Tokyo,  Japan.  During his year-long tenure, Dr. Haugan  will work
              with Dr. Shoji Tanaka, Director of  the Superconductivity Research Laboratory.
              on a  research project entitled "Growth and Synthesis  of High Tc
              Superconductors for Bulk  Applications."    The research project focuses on
              phase  transformations occurring along different  reaction pathways.  To study
              the complicated,  sometimes kinetically fast reactions that can  occur in the
              liquid-solid "melts" during bulk  synthesis, several methods will be used. 
              Solid  phase reactions will be analyzed using real-  time high temperature
              X-ray diffraction (XRD).   To study complicated liquid phase coalescence  and
              reaction phenomena, bulk superconductors  will be quenched from different times
              in a  reaction sequence and alayzed by several  methods, including film surface
              XRD, powder  XRD, surface scanning electron microscopy  (SEM), polished
              cross-sectional SEM, energy  dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and SQUID.  
              Quantitative percentages of crystalline,  amorphous and quenched liquid-like
              phases  present in the reacted and quenched  superconductors will be determined
              by SEM image  analysis and XRD methods.  These methods are  particularly suited
              for studying melt or  liquid-assisted bulk processing.  ***
