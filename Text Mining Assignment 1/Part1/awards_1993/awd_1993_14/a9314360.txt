                  PURDY 9314360           This is a technical proposal to replace the
              existing 400 Mbyte capacity recording system in the thirty ONR ocean bottom
              seismometer instruments with new systems with a capacity in excess of 2
              gigabytes The ONR instruments are operated by Scripps Institution of
              Oceanography and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution as a facility for the US
              academic community.  Thus this improved recording capacity can potentially
              benefit a side range of marine seismic experiments.
