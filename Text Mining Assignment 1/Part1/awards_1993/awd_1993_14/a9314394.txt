Abstract    :
              9314394  Sansone    Previous studies on Loihi seamount found low-temperature 
              hydrothermal vents with bacterial communities. These vents are very  different
              from those found in ridge-axis environments in by virtue  of being highly
              gas-charged with high volatile/heat ratios; and  high 3He and CH4 plumes have
              been found as well. Thus, Loihi seems  to have an end-member hydrothermal
              system this quite different from  the ridge-axis systems. In this project, the
              PIs will go back to  Loihi and dive with Pisces V fitted with the new and
              improved gas  sampler and obtain an accurate sampling of the volatile phases
              that  are pouring out of these low-T vents. They will analyze the gases, 
              particles, and ions that are being brought out by the vents into  the sea
              water. Their main goal is to characterize the thermal,  chemical, and particle
              fluxes at these vents.
