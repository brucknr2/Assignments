Abstract    :
              9314768  Huntoon       This award funds an Iris Indigo workstation to gather
              network  performance measurements for traffic between the Pittsburgh 
              Supercomputer Center and the three other NSF-funded supercomputer  centers. 
              The centers have joined together to form a national  Metacenter, to be linked
              by a high-speed network called the  National Computational Environment.  The
              dedicated probe platform  supported by this award provides a mechanism for
              testing, measuring  and improving network performance over the existing and
              future   communication links.  Duration of the award is one year.  ***
