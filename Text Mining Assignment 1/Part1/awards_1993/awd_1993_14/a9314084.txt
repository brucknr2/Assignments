Abstract    :
              9314084  Goldsman  We are developing a new approach to device simulation by
              direct, self-consistent solution of the Poisson equation and the Boltzmann
              transport equation (BTE).  The method will quickly calculate the momentum
              distribution function for a semiconductor device.  To solve the BTE, the
              distribution function  will be expressed as a quasi-infinite spherical harmonic
              (SH) expansion, with unknown coefficients that depend on energy and position. 
              To find the coefficients, a system of arbitrarily high-order equations will be
              obtained by projecting the BTE onto the SH basis.  The system will then be
              solved numerically to yield the coefficients and thereby the device
              distribution function.  ***
