Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is an award to fund a workshop composed of NSF grantees whose             
              awards were made in the two years of competitions under the                    
              Coordination Theory and Collaboration Technology (CTCT) Initiative             
              and grantees of subsequent awards in these fields. The total number            
              of grants involved is thirty-three, an increase of eight from last             
              year.  This year, awardees whose research is in robotic                        
              coordination will also participate.  Those awards made from the                
              Robotics and Machine Intelligence Program constitute evidence of               
              the growth of the field into other program funding domains.  The               
              purposes of the workshop are:  First, to provide a forum for the               
              exchange of knowledge in the form of perspectives, findings,                   
              methods and theory for this young, interdisciplinary field.                    
              Second, to provide an opportunity for the field to coalesce and                
              grow.  While certain subsets of the community of researchers mingle            
              at various professional meetings, as a whole, these investigators              
              do not have regular contact.  The workshop provides an opportunity             
              to establish an identity for the area of work and to plan                      
              subsequent activities.  Third, this provides an opportunity for the            
              research from these projects to be made more visible to the                    
              Washington-based research funding and policy community.  This                  
              workshop represents a planning opportunity for the IT&O Program.               
              The future research agenda for CTCT funding and community-building             
              is an important part of the workshop program.  The workshop will be            
              held on July 8-10, 1993 in Arlington, Virginia.  A workshop report             
              will be prepared and made available. //
