Abstract    :
              9314541  Turner       As communication networks get larger and more complex, the
               need for careful planning in the design and configuration stage  becomes more
              and more important.  Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM)  networks introduce
              several new issues in network design.  First,  they are multirate networks,
              supporting a wide range of connection  bandwidths and must provide quality of
              service guarantees.  Second,  they must support multipoint virtual circuits, in
              addition to  point-to-point.  Third, they are inherently less predictable than 
              prior communications networks, making it difficult to apply  classical network
              design methods that rely on statistical traffic  analysis.  The research
              proposed here seeks to address these issues  through the formulation of new
              approaches to network design that  take a worst-case viewpoint and which seek
              to minimize the amount  of information that network designers must provide,
              when specifying  a network design.  ***
