Abstract    :
              9314927  Dorn  Pilot results from glacial moraines in the southwestern United 
              States demonstrate that it is possible to obtain 14C ages from  conventional
              radiocarbon measurements on disseminated organic  extracted from the matrix of
              moraines.  Two moraines that were  previously mapped as 'late Wisconsin', based
              on moraine morphology,  morphostratigraphic positioin, soils and weathering 
              characteristics, yielded conventional radiocarbon ages that fall  within 'state
              2' of the marine oxygen isotope chronology.  One  mapped as 'early Wisconsin'
              yielded an infinite 14C ages could  expand rapidly.  this is potentially
              dangerous, because there are  a number of confounding factors that could
              produce misleading ages.   The objective of this proposal is to assess if this
              method is  subject to confounding factors, by sampling tills at sites with 
              independent age control.
