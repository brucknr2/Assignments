Abstract    :
                9314094  Ianna  Parallaxes and proper motions of stars form the foundation for
              the  cosmic distance scale and consequently the foundation of our 
              understanding such diverse topics as the evolution of stars, the  distances to
              other galaxies and the age of the universe.  These  investigators are
              conducting the only long term parallax and proper  motion program for stars in
              the southern hemisphere.  In the  continuation of this work, the parallaxes of
              white dwarf stars,  subdwarf stars and low luminosity cool main sequence stars
              will be  emphasized.  ***
