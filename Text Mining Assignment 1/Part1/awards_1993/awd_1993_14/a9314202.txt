Abstract    :
              9314202  Herring         The International Congress of Vertebrate Morphology
              (ICVM)  promotes international communication and cooperation in  vertebrate
              morphology and other biological sciences. Morphology  plays a unique role in
              organismal biology in that it integrates  and forms the context for
              observations from a variety of  disciplines. The Fourth Congress will be in
              North America and is  expected to attract a large number of distinguished
              scientists  from many countries. The purposes of ICVM-4 are to make the most 
              current research in vertebrate morphology available to North  American
              scientists and to provide the syntheses between  vertebrate morphology and its
              cognate fields that will provide  direction through the 90's and into the next
              century.       Holding of ICVM-4 in the U.S. presents a rare opportunity  for a
              large number of Americans to be exposed to the work of  European and other
              scholars. Although aspects of morphology are  strongly represented in the U.S.,
              many areas are centered  elsewhere. Previously, only scientists who traveled to
              European  meetings could take full advantage of new developments in these 
              fields.       The scientific focus of the Congress will be provided by an 
              invited program consisting of (1) plenary lectures delineating  the
              interactions between morphology and population biology,  ecology, physiology
              evolution and development; (2) informal,  hands-on workshops intended to
              stimulate discussion and  interaction, and (3) formal symposia directed at
              major syntheses  of modern research areas, such as integrating molecular
              findings  into the framework of organismal biology and exploring how 
              physiological and paleontological evidence can be combined to  study
              evolutionary transitions. The Congress will also feature  contributed paper and
              poster sessions in a format intended to  enhance social interactions among the
              participants.  ***
