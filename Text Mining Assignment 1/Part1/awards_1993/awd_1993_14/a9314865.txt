Abstract    :
              9314865  Borden           The focus of this research is the investigation of the
              physical   and chemical properties of pyramidalized alkenes.  Gas-phase  
              measurements on the radical anions of the most highly   pyramidalized alkenes
              will provide values for singlet-triplet   energy spearations and heats of
              hydrogenation.  Separate   computational studies will be conducted on strained
              olefins,   carbenes, potential surfaces for organic reactions, fluorine  
              substituent effects, radicals, diradicals, effects of   substituents and
              heteroatom substitution on open-shell   molecules, and determining which
              computational methodologies   are most appropriate for performing calculations
              on different   types of open-shell systems.     With this Renewal award, the
              Synthetic Organic Program is   supporting the research of Dr. Weston T. Borden
              of the   Department of Chemistry at the University of Washington.    Professor
              Borden will focus his work on the experimental and   computational studies of
              highly strained carbon-containing   molecules.  His work provides an insight
              into the limits of   bonding possible for carbon.   ***
