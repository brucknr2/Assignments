Abstract    :
              9314467  Kintsch    This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative
              research  in information sciences between Walter Kintsch of the University  of
              Colorado and Guy Denhiere of the University of Paris, VIII.  The investigators
              specialize in systems that mediate between  computers and humans, specifically,
              in natural language  understanding.  The objective of their research is to
              develop a  new computer architecture for cognition suited to the study of 
              comprehension processes.  Their proposed model is a hybrid  that  combines a
              production system based on weak rules with a  constraint process that
              stimulates the formation of mental  representations.  Weak rules, for example,
              are word  identification rules that lead to more than one possible meaning  of
              a word.    U.S. and French complementary expertise in theory and experiment 
              will advance this effort.  A joint experimental program to test  the new model
              through computer simulations is proposed. This  project will advance
              understanding in natural language  processing.  ***
