                   9314588 Satterlie  This action is to provide travel costs for scientists
              to attend a special symposium at the Annual Meeting of The American Society of
              Zoologists on December 27 30, 1993.  The symposium will consider invertebrate
              neuromuscular systems, and especially how variability in their cellular and
              developmental organization is reflected in behavior.  This is an important
              topic that is important to both general and comparative neurobiology.  The
              symposium will be important for synthesizing new data and suggesting new
              insights into how the brain controls movement.  The lectures will be published
              in a special issue of the journal "American Zoologist".  All of the scientists
              receiving support are American scientists, who will be speaking at the
              symposium and contributing papers to the final publication. ***
