                              An earthquake swarm located teleseismically in a small region
              about 300 km west of the East Pacific Rise at 18 degrees south and 116 degrees
              west prompted the deployment of ocean bottom seismometers near the site during
              a multibeam and side scan survey of the ridge.  Hundreds of microearthquakes
              located within or near the array of oceanbottom seismometers, the side scan
              sonar, and the multibeam bathymetric data will be analyzed.  A comparative
              event analysis of the location and mechanism of the location and mechanism of
              the teleseismically recorded events will be conducted, and the stresses that
              would be expected for a variety of different mechanisms will be modeled to aid
              in understanding the tectonci role of this earthquake sequence.
