Abstract    :
              Nucleic acid biophysics and DNA-small molecule interactions                    
              will be investigated by constructing monolayer electrodes with                 
              pendant DNA intercalators such as ethidium and exposing these                  
              surfaces to aqueous solutions of nucleic acid.  The specific                   
              aims are: 1) to assemble and characterize monolayer electrodes                 
              with pendant functionalities known to bind DNA, 2) to study the                
              binding of DNA to these electrodes and the bioplysics of the                   
              bound nucleic acid, 3) to study the interactions of exogenous                  
              metallointercalators with the bound DNA, and 4) to investigate                 
              the energetics of DNA cleavage by bound drugs such as beomycin.                
              In a separate but related project use will be made of the                      
              diverse new technology of polymer-modified electrodes to                       
              construct model metalloenzymes.  In these systems, the electron                
              relay will be provided by the electrode, and the protein                       
              environment will be simulated by the polymer film.

              Dr. H. Hoden Thorp of the University of North Carolina at                      
              Chapel Hill is supported as a Presidential Young Investigator                  
              by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry                   
              program.  Dr. Thorp's project is in the area of bioinorganic                   
              chemistry and has the key goals of improving our understanding                 
              of the interactions of metal complexes with DNA and modeling                   
              the structure and function of redox metalloenzymes.  Extensive                 
              application of recent advances in the preparation of chemically                
              modified electrodes will be made.
