Abstract    :
              9314308  Cox        This project seeks to investigate the role of very short
              capillary  waves in transmitting momentum from the atmosphere to the ocean.  
              The research consists of two phases: a laboratory experiment in the  SIO wave
              channel, and a sea-going experiment with instruments  deployed from "FLIP" in
              which measurements of wind profile,  capillary and larger waves will be made. 
              The study aims to take  advantage of a successful new optical technique
              developed by Zhang  and Cox (1992) for measuring both components of the surface
              slopes  simultaneously.  These measurements are combined with measurements  of
              vorticity and velocity in the water to map the distribution of  momentum
              transfer at the ocean surface.
