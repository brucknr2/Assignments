Abstract    :
              9314073  Hiltner         This award provides funding for the first year of a
              three-year  continuing award for support of an evaluator at Case Western 
              Reserve University's Industry/University Cooperative Research  Center for
              Applied Polymer Research.  The Center continues to meet  the renewal criteria
              requirements of the I/UCRC Program.    The evaluator of the Center duties
              consist of writing a Historical  Profile, taking Surveys of industrial members
              and faculty, advising  the Director of the Center and IAB members, attending
              annual  evaluator meetings, and conducting exit interviews with departing 
              companies.    The Program Manager recommends Case Western Reserve University be
               awarded $8,000 for the first year of a three-year continuing award  to support
              the evaluator at the Center.
