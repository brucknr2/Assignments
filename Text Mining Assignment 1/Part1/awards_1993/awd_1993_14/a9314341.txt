Abstract    :
              9314341  Gallager       The primary goal of the research is to develop a
              cohesive  theory and set of insights for wireless multiaccess communication.  
              Attention will be restricted to cellular type systems in which  mobile or
              stationary users communicate over a multipath fading  environment with fixed
              stations that are interconnected by wire.   In the current struggle for
              dominance among various approach are  based on the capabilities  of currently
              developed systems.  To   provide a better guide for future systems, there is a
              need for a  more cohesive structure that exhibits the fundamental limitations 
              on the different approaches.  The main thrusts of this  investigation will
              focus on multiple access information theory and  detection theory for fading
              channels, random access communication,  and spread spectrum and other
              modulation techniques.  Important  topics within each of these thrusts will be
              power control, the use  of multiple antennas, forward error correction, and the
              adaptation  to varying channel conditions.  ***
