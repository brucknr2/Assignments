Abstract    :
              9314076  Jung    This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research
               in organic synthesis chemistry between Michael E. Jung,  University of
              California, Los Angeles, and Alex Alexakis, Pierre  and Marie Curie University,
              Paris, France.  The objective of  their research is to study asymmetric
              induction of homochiral  ketals and aminals in various cyclization reactions. 
              They will  determine the utility of these chemical processes in organic 
              synthesis, namely whether these cyclizations proceed well enough  to be
              generally useful in the synthesis of complex natural  products in optically
              pure form.    This project takes advantage of French expertise in chiral ketals
               and aminals in synthesis.  This is complemented by the U.S.  group's expertise
              in intramolecular cyclization reactions.  This  proposal will advances
              understanding of new techniques for  organic synthesis and characterization. 
              It may also form the  basis for designed synthesis of natural products.
