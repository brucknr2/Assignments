Abstract    :
              9314214  Sagues    This U.S.-Mexico award will support a research workshop in 
              connection with the 1st Mexican Symposium/ 2nd International  Workshop on
              Corrosion.  Organized by Professor Alberto Sagues of  the University of South
              Florida and Professor Luis Maldonado Lopez  of the Centro de Investigacion y de
              Estudios Avanzados del IPN  (CINVESTAV-Merida), the workshop aims to present
              and discuss the  most recent advances in corrosion science and engineering, 
              including, for example, advances in cathodic protection, coatings,  and
              electrochemical impedance.    By getting together experts in high temperature
              corrosion and  corrosion of reinforcing steel, this workshop will address
              topics  of importance to both the U.S. and Mexico.  Through short courses, 
              lectures, and personal interactions, the workshop will offer  participants the
              opportunity to establish new international  collaborations.  ***
