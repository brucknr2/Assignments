Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to develop a unified framework for  modeling,
              expressing and efficiently supporting semantic concepts  and constraints
              required for building the next generation of  intelligent information systems. 
              The proposed unification will  include non-determinism in deductive rules and
              active rules for  databases, non monotonic logic and common-sense reasoning. 
              The  project goals will achieved through the collaborative of leading  research
              teams who are currently active in these areas in the U.S.  and Europe. 
              Dissemination of the research results will be through  scholarly publications
              and a major international workshop organized  in the second year of the
              project.  Specific research tasks will  address.
