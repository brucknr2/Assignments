Abstract    :
              9314549  Gordon    This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative
              research  in earth sciences on problems of global plate tectonics and 
              reconstructions.  The U.S. scientists are Richard Gordon,  Northwestern
              University, Charles DeMets, University of Wisconsin  and a graduate student. 
              The French scientists are Jean-Yves  Royer of the Underwater Laboratory,
              Villefranche-sur-Mer and a  graduate student.  The investigators will examine
              plate  reconstructions in the Indian Ocean with applications to the  kinematics
              and tectonics of the deforming zone between India and  Australia.     The U.S.
              investigator brings to this collaboration expertise in  quantitative analysis
              of plate motions as applied to problems of  global tectonics.  This
              complemented by the French investigator,  a marine geologist with expertise in
              plate reconstruction  techniques and its application to marine tectonics. 
              Studying the  unique plate deforming zone in the Indian Ocean is important for 
              continental studies of plate tectonics and their capabilities in  predicting
              earthquakes.  ***
