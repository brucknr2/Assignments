Abstract    :
              IRI-9314946  The  research to be conducted concerns the generation  of  speech 
              signals in terms of (a) an articulatory description of the  vocal  system,  and
               (b)  a fluid dynamic soluction to  the  generation,  propagation,  and 
              radiation of audible  sound  produced  by  the  acoustic  system.  This
              includes the computation  of  the  speech  signal from first principles, using
              the Navier-Stokes description  of  fluid flow, already demonstrated
              feasible.Anticipated results  include  a potentially significant improvement in
              the quality  of  synthesized speech and fundamentally new and  more robust
              designs  of speech recognizers stemming from a better understanding of the 
              speech  phenomena  and  how  it  can  be  made  more  immune   to 
              interference.   Also it is expected that this research  influence  improvements
              in the coding of  speech at lower bit rates.
