Abstract    :
              9314029  Davies  This award will support the U.S. contribution to a cooperative 
              project with British scientists which will integrate and synthesize  data from
              Ocean Drilling Project  and Deep Sea Drilling Project  sites in the circum
              Antarctic basins, the south Atlantic and the  southern Pacific and Indian
              Oceans. The basic objective of the  project is to determine the history of
              bottom water formation  around Antarctica and to trace the development of the
              Circum Polar  Current in response to the breakup of Gondwana. This will be 
              accomplished through the preparation and interpretation of maps  showing
              changes in sediment distribution in the southern oceans  through the Cenozoic.
              These data will be integrated with stable  isotope and other time-series and
              faunal data from drilling sites.  In addition to further defining Cenozoic
              paleoceanography, the data  and interpretations from this project will be
              important in defining  future ocean drilling objectives in the region.  ***
