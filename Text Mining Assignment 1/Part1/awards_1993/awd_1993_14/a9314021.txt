Abstract    :
              9314021  Knopoff    This two-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative
              research in  seismology between Leon Knopoff of the University of California 
              at Los Angeles (UCLA) and Didier Sornette of the University of  Nice.  The
              objective of the research is to study a fuse model of  precursory seismicity
              prior to strong earthquakes.  The U.S.  investigator and the group at UCLA
              brings to this collaboration  significant expertise in adapting crack fusion
              models to  earthquake problems.  This is complemented by the French group's 
              expertise in evaluating the physics of a thermal fuse theory of  earthquake
              prediction.    The proposed model involves the relationship between fault 
              geometry and earthquake space-time distributions.  The research  can be applied
              to problems of earthquake prediction. It is of  potential benefit to the
              petroleum production industry in that it  will enhance understanding of the
              relationship of seismicity to  hydrofactures.  ***
