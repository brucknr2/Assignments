Abstract    :
              The objective of the proposed research is the development of  numerical
              computing systems which operate with a small amount of  electrical power.  It
              concentrates on arithmetic structures and  algorithms and models power
              consumption by the number of signal  transitions.  These low-power structures
              are essential for the  development of future computing systems.  The proposed
              research  will further the understanding of the effect of number 
              representation, algorithm, and implementation on the power  dissipation of
              numerical computation structures.  Moreover, methods  and technique for the
              design of low-power structures will be  developed, as well as low-power designs
              for specific operations,  such as adders, comparators, multipliers, and
              dividers.
