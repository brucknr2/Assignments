Abstract    :
              9314484  Salmon    The Geophysical Fluid Dynamics (GFD) Program is a 10-week
              program  of  interdisciplinary research and graduate  training  which  has 
              been  held each summer since 1959 at the Woods Hole Oceanographic  Institution.
                GFD promotes an exchange of ideas among  the  many  distinct  fields that
              share an interest in the nonlinear dynamics  of  rotating, stratified fluids. 
              These fields include  classical  fluid dynamics, physical oceanography,
              meteorology, astrophysics,  planetary atmospheres, geological fluid dynamics,
              hydromagnetics,  and  applied mathematics.  The next 5 summer sessions of GFD
              have  the  following topics for FY94, 95, 96, 97, and 98, respectively: 
              biological-physical  interactions,  rotating  convection,  double  diffusion 
              in oceanography and astrophysics, boundary control  in  nonlinear  geophysical
              flows, and fluid dynamics in astrophysical  disks.    ***
