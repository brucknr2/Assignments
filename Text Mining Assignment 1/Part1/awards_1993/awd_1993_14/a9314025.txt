Abstract    :
              9314025  Halperin    Technical Abstract:  The project employs nuclear magnetic
              resonance  to investigate the superfluid phases of 3He.  The research involves 
              high precision measurements of the magnetic moment of the helium in  the A and
              B phases, as well as determination of the contribution of  the dipole-dipole
              coupling energies to the superfluid free energy.   The novel dilute mixtures of
              4He in 4He, found only in constrained  geometries of aerogels will also be
              investigated to characterize  the miscibility gap in these systems and to
              investigate diffusion  and relaxation phenomena in these new materials.  The
              NMR studies  of molecular organic solids will focus on fundamental questions 
              concerning the origin of the metallic state in these quasi-one-  dimensional
              solids.  The experiments will involve ultralow  temperatures and high magnetic
              fields.    Non-technical abstract:  The research project employs low 
              temperature nuclear magnetic resonance to study the behavior of  superfluid
              phases of 3He.  These systems display unusual quantum  effects at very low
              temperatures.  The information obtained in  these superfluid systems is of
              fundamental interest, and also is of  interest in connection with other Fermi
              liquid systems, such as the  high temperature superconductors.  Another part of
              the project  involves studies of thin films of dilute 4He in 3He constrained in
               the diaphanous, ultrahigh surface area aerogel materials.  The  research will
              provide information about surface interactions in  these materials, as well as
              providing fundamental information about  phase behavior such as miscibility of
              the two isotopes of helium.   Finally, the project includes NMR studies of high
              purity molecular  organic solids which display metallic character with the 
              conductivity having a quasi-one-dimensional anisotropy.  Here the  focus is on
              fundamental aspects of the phase transition from an  insulating to conducting
              state.  ***
