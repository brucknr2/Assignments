Abstract    :
              9314783  Cameron  The Indiana University Cyclotron Facility is a national user
              facility for research in  nuclear science.  This grant provides funds for the
              operation of IUCF, for support of its  user program, for the research of the
              Indiana University staff, and for the training of  graduate students in nuclear
              science, accelerator physics, and related fields.  The  facilities at IUCF
              include a 200 MeV cyclotron and a 500 MeV booster synchrotron with  electron
              beam cooling.  Experiments are possible with the extracted cyclotron beam in 
              several experimental areas, and using ultra-thin internal targets in the Cooler
              ring.   Polarized beams are available in all areas, and polarized gas targets
              can be used in  the Cooler ring.  A new high-intensity polarized ion source
              (HIPIOS) will provide a  twenty-fold increase in beam currents. A wide variety
              of detectors can be used,  including magnetic spectrometers, neutron
              time-of-flight systems, recoil detector, and  large scintillator and wire
              chamber arrays.  The K600 spectrometer with focal plane  polarimeter and Beam
              Swinger neutron detection system will be used in a broad range  of spin
              transfer reactions aimed at studying effective nucleon-nucleon interactions.  
              Studies will be carried out in threshold meson production, few-body reactions, 
              nucleon-nucleon scattering, nucleon-nucleus reactions, all directed towards
              improved  understanding of the hadronic substructure of nuclei, the underlying
              role of meson  degrees of freedom, and tests of fundamental symmetries.
              Graduate students and  undergraduates are integrated into all aspects of IUCF
              research, including  instrumentation development, and their training is a
              prominent aspect of IUCF  activities.
