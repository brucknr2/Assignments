Abstract    :
              9314185  LiKamWa  The speed of opto-electronic devices fabricated using MQWs are
              governed by the rate of carrier removal from the MQW region.  We have
              previously shown that, by applying an electric field across the MQW, carrier
              sweep-out significantly improves on the recovery of an all-optical directional
              coupler switch.  In most devices, carrier sweep-out is achieved through
              vertical transport across the quantum wells and in these cases, the carrier
              escape mechanisms are a combination of thermionic emission, tunneling,
              scattering and recombination.  Significant carrier re-trapping can also take
              place in adjacent wells and this slow down the recovery rate of the devices. In
              this novel approach, we propose to sweep the photo-generated carriers away from
              the switching region by lateral sweep-out in a horizontal electric field.  The
              rate of carrier removal in this case would then be dependent on the guided spot
              size, the electric field and the carrier drift velocities.  The device recovery
              rate would also be a second order exponential of the form y=e -12/A, which has
              a more complete recovery in the long time regime, compared to the exponential
              recovery normally associated with thermionic emission times.  Lateral carrier
              sweep-out should also be applicable to a wide variety of other MQW
              opto-electronic devices.  ***
