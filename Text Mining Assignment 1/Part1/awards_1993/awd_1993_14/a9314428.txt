Abstract    :
              9314428  Grant        From 25 June to 1 July 1994, the University of Colorado
              will host on its  Boulder campus a conference entitled: "Symposium on
              Diophantine Problems in  honor of Wolfgang Schmidt's 60th Birthday."
              Diophantine Problems are of three  types: 1)Diophantine equations, which ask
              how many and which whole numbers  satisfy given polynomials equations with
              whole number coefficients;  2)Diophantine approximation, which at its base asks
              how well real numbers can  be approximated by ratios of whole numbers; and
              3)Diophantine geometry, which  studies the number of regularly spaced points
              within certain geometric  objects.        Recently some remarkable results have
              been established in these fields,  and it seems an appropriate time to bring
              together the leading mathematicians  in these areas, so that they can interact
              with each other and disseminate  ideas to young researchers.  It is a happy
              coincidence that this era of rapid  progress coincides with Schmidt's 60th
              birthday.  ***
