Abstract    :
              9314372  Williams    This award provides travel support for Dr. Dana Williams of
              the  Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Dartmouth  College, to
              spend two months conducting collaborative research  with Professor Iain Raeburn
              at the University of Newcastle in   Australia. As a part of this cooperative
              activity, Dr. Raeburn  will make a reciprocal visit to Dartmouth College in
              late 1994  or early 1995 supported by the Australian Department of Industry, 
              Technology and Regional Development. The topic of the research  is the
              definition of the Brauer group for dynamical systems.    Dynamical systems are
              mathematical realizations of physical  situations involving time evolution or
              symmetries. Recent  theoretical work has led the collaborators to the
              realization  that there is an important underlying structure in which various 
              non-commutative systems associated to a fixed commutative system  form a group
              - the equivariant Brauer group.  Using this new  approach will allow the
              initiation of a program which applies  sophisticated algebraic techniques to
              dynamical systems.
