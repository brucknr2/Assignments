Abstract    :
              9314701 Peyghambarian The goals of this proposed program are focused toward the
              investigation of novel phenomena and their applications in demonstrating new
              types of optoelectronic devices, including high speed and high contrast
              switches and quantum confines lasers.  Specifically, the objectives are
              fourfold:  (1) Femtosecond pulse propagation and soliton like pulses in
              semiconductor laser amplifiers.  (2) Ultrafast switching in a current injected
              semiconductor quantum well nonlinear directional coupler.  (3) Novel quantum
              dot circular rating lasers.  (4) A high contrast quantum well modulator. ***
