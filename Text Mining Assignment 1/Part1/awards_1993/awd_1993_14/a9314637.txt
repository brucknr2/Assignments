Abstract    :
              9314637  Hsu       The Conference on Diffusion Theory and Analysis will  take
              place at Northwestern University from June 25 to June  30, 1994.  The major
              activities during the conference are 15  invited one-hour presentations and
              free discussion sessions.       The main purpose of this conference is to offer
              an  opportunity for the mathematicians working in diffusion  theory and
              analysis and other related fields to communicate  and update their latest
              knowledge on the subject.       Diffusion theory as a part of probability
              theory  studies collective behaviors of a special class of random  systems. 
              These random systems are characterized by the  properties that they evolve
              continuously in time and  possessing so-called Markov property, which roughly
              means  that the future of a system is independent of its past  history and is
              completely determined by its present state.  The class of random systems have
              been studies extensively  both for its rich mathematical structure and its
              practical  applications in science and engineering.       Our conference
              emphasizes the mathematical aspect of  diffusion theory, especially its
              applications in analytical  fields such as differential geometry and
              differential  equations.  The speakers are carefully selected to reflect  the
              current state of the art of the field.  They are active  research
              mathematicians whose lectures will no doubt both  promote further research in
              the field and serve current  educational activities by attracting new graduate
              students  into our field.
