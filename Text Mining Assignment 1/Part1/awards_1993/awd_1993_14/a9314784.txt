Abstract    :
              9314784  Tressler    This two-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative
              research in  materials science between Richard E. Tressler of Pennsylvania
              State  University and Roger Naslain of the University of Bordeaux.  The 
              objectives of the research are to develop superior high-temperature  fibers
              (silicon carbide matrix composites) using polymer processing  and to relate the
              chemical composition/thermal stability to  microstructure and creep properties
              of these fibers.  The U.S.  investigator brings to this collaboration expertise
              in  microstructure and creep properties.  This complemented by recent  French
              work in fiber processing.      Silicon carbide matrix composites are leading
              candidates for  aerospace and industrial process machinery applications. 
              However,  current candidates are limited in size and in thermal resistance. 
              This project will advance understanding of their structure and  properties and
              lead to the development of high temperature fibers  that are not currently
              available.  ***
