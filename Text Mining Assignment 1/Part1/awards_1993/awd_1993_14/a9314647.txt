Abstract    :
              OCE-09314647    In this project, the P.I.s will carry out a combined field 
              (geochemical) and modelling study on two segments of the slow-  intermediate
              spreading MAR at 31-35S.  The P.I.s wish to capitalize  on a possible window of
              opportunity of Ewing being in this part of  the Atlantic around the proposed
              time.  They will focus on two  along axis geochemical anomalies near 33S:  the
              first is a  206Pb/204Pb spike at segment 4, and the second is high Na8.0/low 
              Fe8.0 anomaly at segment 3.  The P.I.s contend that in the latter  area they
              can obtain best constraints on the temporal component of  a transform fault
              effect (TFE).  Zero-age and off-axis sampling (to  8 Ma old crust) of these two
              anomalies will allow them to decipher  the extent of mantle geochemical
              heterogeneities and melting  processes.  Using such constraints the P.I.s
              ultimately wish to  develop satisfactory models of upper mantle heterogeneities
              and  convection.  Michael & Hanan will be co-chiefs.  Michael will  perform
              electron probe analysis of glasses at Tulsa and trace  elements with Ion Probe
              (WHOI), DCP (Lamont) or ICP-MS (Cornell).   Hanan will be responsible for
              isotopic work.
