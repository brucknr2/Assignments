Abstract    :
              This collaborative effort is for the analysis of turbulence, shear  and internal
              waves data collected on the Equator as part of the  1991 Tropical Instability
              Wave Experiment (TIWE). TIWE was designed  to study the effects of the 21-days
              tropical instability waves on  mixing and internal waves. The scientific issues
              to be addressed in  the analysis include the deep diurnal mixing cycle,
              turbulence  within the surface mixed layer and below the core of the Equatorial
               Undercurrent, the role of upper ocean turbulence in sea surface  temperature
              modification,and  the statistical distribution of  dissipation rates.
