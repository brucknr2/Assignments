Abstract    :
              9314699  Wad  This U.S.-Mexico award will support Prof. Atul Wad  of
              Northwestern University and Prof. Hernan Cruz  Nucamendy of the Universidad
              Autonoma de Yucatan,  Mexico, to organize and conduct a research workshop  that
              will analyze the role of technology as an agent  of industrial development in
              the context of  increasing U.S.-Mexico economic integration.    The workshop
              will explore various examples of  indigenous technological developments within
              the  framework of search, acquisition and sourcing  strategies by Mexican
              enterprises.  The relationship  of these approaches to international technology
               cooperation will be discussed from various  disciplinary perspectives and from
              both theoretical  and practical viewpoints.   ***
