Abstract    :
              9314187  Edwards    This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative
              research  in stellar astronomy and astrophysics between research groups  from
              Five Colleges Incorporated, Amherst, Massachusetts, and the  Astronomical
              Observatory in Grenoble, France.  Five Colleges  Incorporated is a consortium
              of astronomy departments of Smith,  Amherst, Mount Holyoke, Hampshire College
              and the University of  Massachusetts.  Suzan Edwards of Smith College and the
              Director  of the Grenoble Observatory, Claude Bertout, are the principal 
              investigators and team leaders.  The objective of their research  is to study
              the physical relationship and the origin of solar  winds and accretion disks
              that surround very young stars.     The U.S. investigators are observational
              astronomers and  assembled and analyzed a collection of data on T Tauri stars. 
               Their research will be complemented by the theoretical star  formation group
              in Grenoble, who will interpret the data. Solar  winds appear to play vital
              role in star formation.  Their origin  and characteristics will advance our
              understanding of how new  stars are created.  ***
