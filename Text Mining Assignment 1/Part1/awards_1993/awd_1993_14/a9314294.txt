Abstract    :
              9314294  Newcomb    This two-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative
              research  in organic dynamics between Martin Newcomb of Wayne State  University
              and S. Z. Zard of the Ecole Polytechnique.  Their  research involves kinetic
              measurements of very fast free radical  reactions. They will study stabilized
              carbon-and nitrogen-  centered radicals, which are neutral groups of atoms with
              an odd  number of electrons.  The Wayne State group has developed a  general
              method for the kinetic study of a broad range of  radicals.  The French group
              will prepare precursors  specifically  designed for the kinetic method
              developed by Wayne State.  They  will isolate and characterize products
              resulting from the  reactions.  The Wayne State group will then measure the
              rate  constants of the reactions and develop a scale of radical  kinetics.   
              The U.S. investigators bring to this collaboration expertise in  physical
              organic chemistry.  This is complemented by the French  investigators'
              expertise in organic synthesis.  Their joint work  will advance understanding
              of this new method which could be used  in studying a wide variety of organic
              and biological reactions  that involve radical intermediates.  ***
