                    ABSTRACT    P.I. Robert Sussman/Thad Bartlett  SBR - 9314804    Monogamy
              is relatively rare among our primate relatives, as well as mammals generally,
              and its determinants have not been clearly established.  Typically, monogamy is
              argued to result when certain ecological constraints impinge - that in certain
              circumstances, males may be unable to monopolize more than one female, and
              ultimately, that males may not be able to control a sufficient resource base to
              support more than a single female and her dependent offspring.  In larger Old
              World species, particularly gibbons, the argument has generally been that
              monogamy is a response to their dependence on small scattered resources that
              are presumably unbable to support larger social groups.  However, there is a
              paucity of information on gibbon foraging behavior in relation to resouce
              availability, partially because most of the data have been collected in
              equatorial rain forests where there is little seasonality of resources, and
              plant diversity is high.    This study will take place in a simpler habitat,
              with distinct wet and dry seasons, where gross changes in food availability
              will be more apparent, and where monitoring the variation in food resources can
              be related to ranging and social behaviors of the gibbons.  It will permit a
              clear evaluation of current hypotheses concerning the interrelationship between
              resource distribution and social structure.    This study will be supported
              partially by a Fulbright award.  ***  P\anthro\jfried\9314804.abs
