Abstract    :
              9314736  Castro    This Americas Program award will support attendance of  a
              group of Latin American shorebird biologists to a  conference on shorebird
              research.   The purpose of the  conference is to review recent findings and
              determine  priorities for shorebird research and management in  the Western
              Hemisphere.  Coordinators for the  conference, which will be held in Ottawa,
              Canada,  October 1994, are Dr. Gonzalo Castro and Dr. Julie  Sibbing, of the
              Western Hemisphere Shorebird Reserve  Network.  Other coordinators include
              representatives  from Canada, Mexico, Peru and Argentina.  The  conference will
              include presentations of papers by  researchers and managers, and working group
              sessions  for developing conclusions and recommendations.     Most species of
              shorebirds depend upon wetlands as  sources of food throughout their annual
              cycle of   extensive, interhemispheric migrations.  Wetlands in  the Americas
              continue to be drained, or otherwise  rendered unsuitable for use by the birds
              at a rapid  pace, resulting in a precarious relationship between  them and
              their habitats.  This serious loss of  shorebirds habitats across the
              hemisphere has  generated conservation research efforts aimed at the 
              protection of the species.  However, successful  conservation programs demand
              information-sharing and  cooperation among the nations that host the species 
              during their travels.   This conference presents an  opportunity for
              interaction among researchers of the  Western Hemisphere and provides a forum
              for  discussions of the latest findings in shorebird  migration, ecology and
              conservation.   ***
