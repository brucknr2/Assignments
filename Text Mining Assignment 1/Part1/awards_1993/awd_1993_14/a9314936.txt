Abstract    :
                9314936  Cowan  The history of our galaxy is revealed in part by the
              compositions  of stars of various ages.  Recent developments in astronomical 
              instrumentation and in the analysis of stellar spectra have greatly  increased
              the available information on stellar compositions.  The  PI will take advantage
              of this new information to determine the  conditions required for the formation
              of heavy elements.  He will  then trace element generation throughout the
              history of the Galaxy.  The resulting model for the chemical evolution of the
              galaxy will  allow a new determination of the age of the heavy elements.  ***
