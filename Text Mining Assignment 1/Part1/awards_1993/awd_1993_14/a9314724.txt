Abstract    :
                  9314724  Chevalier    The study of supernovae has progressed to the point
              where these  events are valuable probes of stellar evolution and high energy 
              physics.  Observations at X-ray, radio, optical and ultraviolet  wavelengths
              for supernova 1993J will be used to model the  interaction of the shock from
              the exploding star with circumstellar  gas.  Departures from spherical symmetry
              are expected to be  important and will be taken into account.  The effect of
              magnetic  fields on the morphology of planetary nebulae will also be 
              investigated.   ***
