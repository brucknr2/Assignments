Abstract    :
              9314430  Beck  This U.S.-Chile award will support a research  collaboration
              between Dr. Susan L. Beck of the  University of Arizona and Dr. Sergio E.
              Barrientos of  the University of Chile.  The researchers will analyze  historic
              earthquake seismograms from events between  1920 and 1963 along the Chilean
              subduction zone. They  will use modern waveform methods to determine 
              earthquake source parameters  and will evaluate  seismic cycles of the
              underthrusting and normal fault  earthquakes along the coast of Chile.  The
              study will  include detailed analyses of earlier historic  earthquakes.     The
              Chilean subduction zone segment of the Nazca South  American plate boundary has
              failed repeatedly in large  earthquakes.  To better assess future earthquake 
              hazards along this plate boundary, more information  about previous earthquakes
              is needed.  Since this type  of tectonics has parallels in areas of the U.S.
              and  its territories, the proposed study may lead to  increased understanding
              of U.S. earthquakes hazard.  ***
