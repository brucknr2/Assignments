Abstract    :
              9314898  bADBadler       This is a workshop to exchange views on research
              directions  and update the mechanisms used by the research community 
              investigating the area of facial expressions, their semantics, and  their
              animation in the graphical media.  Given the multiplicity and  diversity of
              orientations in the field there is need for a global  assessment of the actual
              state-of-the-art and of improving the  methods of exchange of data and
              software.  In particular, given the  current state of analysis of facial
              expressions there is need to  find commonality of tools for the synthesis of
              the extracted data.   This workshop brings together a small group of leading
              researcher  in the NSF, government, and industrial research community to define
               scientifically defensible, computationally reasonable, and  experimentally
              useful facial models which may provide the basis for  future research.  The
              worksho produces a published account of the  proceedings of the meeting.
