Abstract    :
              9314016  Reddy    The research objective is to determine fundamental data on
              phase  stability in intermetallic aluminides, based on thermodynamic, mass 
              transport, and high temperature environmental properties.  Alloy  systems to be
              studied are aluminides in the titanium-aluminum and  niobium -aluminum alloy
              systems with and without ternary additions.   Solid-state galvanic cell
              measurements are employed in the range of  600 to 1000 degrees Celsius to
              determine the activity, activity  coefficient, and Gibbs free energy of
              formation.  The ternary  additions are in the range of 5 to 25 atom percent and
              include  molybdenum, hafnium, and vanadium.  This research develops needed 
              thermodynamic data for these potentially useful alloys.   %%%  The aluminide
              systems are selected based on their unique structural  properties and practical
              significance.  These high temperature  intermetallic alloys have significant
              potential for use in the  aerospace and automobile industries.  ***
