Abstract    :
              9314098 Pukkila It is known that during meiosis, homologous chromosomes pair and
              then synapse in association with the synaptonemal complex (SC).  The source of
              specificity for homologous pairing is not understood.  It has not been possible
              to obtain direct evidence for DNA DNA interactions that could mediate
              homologous pairing in any system, although such interactions remain an
              attractive possibility to provide the required specificity.   %%% We have
              discovered that prior to meiosis, a genome wide homology search occurs in C.
              cinereus that results in the methylation of duplicated sequences.  We propose
              to ask if the same genes control the homology searches that result in MIP
              (methylation induced premeiotically) and the homology searches that result in
              meiotic pairing.  We will monitor the occurence of MIP in vegetative dikaryotic
              cells from wild type and from three meiotic mutants in which chromosome
              synapsis is defective.  If we can demonstrate an association between a MIP
              defect and pairing defect, we would have a powerful and unique assay to
              identify genes required for homology recognition, which should permit an
              understanding of the mechanisms underlying meiotic chromosome pairing. ***
