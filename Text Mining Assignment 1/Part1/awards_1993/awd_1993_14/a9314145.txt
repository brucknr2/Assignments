Abstract    :
              Pawlik  9314145    Sponges are important components of benthic marine 
              communities, particularly on coral reefs.  Organic extracts  of their tissues
              have yielded a wealth of unusual chemical  compounds that are not known to be
              involved in primary  metabolism.  These secondary metabolites have a diversity
              of  pharmacological effects in laboratory assays, but it is  unclear why
              sponges produce them.  The most commonly held  theory is that these compounds
              are distasteful to potential  predators.  The proposed research will provide an
              assessment  of the chemical  defenses of Caribbean demo sponges, a group  whose
              taxonomy and chemistry is fairly well described.  The  investigation will
              proceed within a theoretical framework  established by previous research on the
              chemical ecology of  terrestrial plants and marine algae.   Overall, this 
              research project represents the first systematic  investigation of the chemical
              defenses of tropical marine  sponges.  The results will be useful in judging
              the general  applicability of optimal defense theories based on studies  of
              terrestrial ecosystems.    ***
