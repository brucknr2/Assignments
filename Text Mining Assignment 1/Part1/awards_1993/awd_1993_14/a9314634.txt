Abstract    :
              9314634  ANDERSON    Uranium is removed from the ocean by precipitation in
              chemically-  reducing sediments. Preliminary results from subantarctic South 
              Atlantic show high rates of authigenic U deposition in glacial-age  sediments.
              The observed burial of uranium implies that one of two  conditions existed in
              the glacial ocean: either greatly-reduced  oxygen content of Circumpolar Deep
              Water (compared to modern levels  in excess of 200 micromolar), or
              greatly-enhanced biological  productivity of subantarctic surface waters.
              Either condition would  represent a significant feature of the carbon cycle in
              the glacial  ocean.    The hypothesis that subantarctic sediments hold the key
              record  which will lead to the long-sought explanation for lower  atmospheric
              CO2 concentrations during the ice ages will be tested  to also derive
              quantitative information about ice-age ocean  productivity and deep-sea 02
              content.
