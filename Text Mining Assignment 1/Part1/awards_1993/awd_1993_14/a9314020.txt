Abstract    :
              9314020  Badding    This work is concerned with the chemistry of covalently
              bonded  hard/superhard materials that are synthesized at high pressure (1 
              gigapascals to greater than 70 gigapascals), but can be quenched to  ambient
              conditions.  These experiments will be performed using  diamond-anvil cell
              techniques together with recently developed  methods for the synthesis and
              characterization of solids at high  pressures.  Syntheses at extreme pressures
              and/or temperatures will  be combined with detailed in situ observations of the
              formation and  properties of hard materials.  The topics to be addressed are
              the  synthesis of diamond and diamond-like materials from novel  polycarbyne
              network-backbone polymers and the synthesis of new hard  materials in the
              carbon-nitrogen and boron-oxygen systems.  The  goals will be to look for new
              hard materials, potentially with  properties superior or complementary to
              existing ones and to gain  new information about the relationship between
              crystal structure,  chemical composition, and hardness that will help in the
              design of  new hard materials.  ***
