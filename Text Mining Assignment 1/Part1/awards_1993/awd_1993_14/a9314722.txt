                                          Abstract  9314722  de Zafra  This project will use
              millimeter-wave detectors to measure  atmospheric column densities and vertical
              profiles of chlorine  monoxide, nitrous oxide and ozone from the ground at
              McMurdo,  Antarctic during the austral spring of 1994.  These trace gases are 
              crucial to the understanding of the formation of the annual  Antarctic ozone
              hole.  The measurements will be carried out in  conjunction with the NASA
              sponsored ER-2 aircraft project which  will be flown from Christchurch, NZ to
              Antarctica during this time  period.    This project is part of the Global
              Change initiative.  Part of the  support for this project is covered by NASA
              through an on-going  grant.  ***
