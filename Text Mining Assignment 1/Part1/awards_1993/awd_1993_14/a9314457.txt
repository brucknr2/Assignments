Abstract    :
              Cavanaugh  9314457    This project will study the biogeography of
              chemoautotrophic  symbioses in marine oligochaetes.  The objectives are to
              answer the  following questions:  Are the symbionts species-specific?  What are
               their phylogenetic relationships among each other, to symbionts  from other
              marine phyla, and to free-living bacteria?  Are the  symbionts within a
              monophyletic host group themselves monophyletic?   If they did not co-evolve
              with their host, is the symbiont  distribution paralleled by its ecological or
              geographic  distribution?  These questions can be addressed with a technically 
              straightforward approach by analyzing the ribosomal RNA sequences  of the
              prokaryotic symbionts in hosts from four geographically  distant locations
              (Bermuda, Belize, Australia and the New England  coast).  The significance of
              the project lies in its ability to  characterize for the first time the
              taxonomy, phylogeny, and  biogeography of chemoautotrophic symbionts in a
              phylum previously  not investigated.  The results will show how wide spread the
               symbioses are and contribute to a better understanding of the  biodiversity of
              chemoautotrophic symbioses in marine habitats.  ***
