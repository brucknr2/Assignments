Abstract    :
              Thistle  9314150    More than 70% of marine benthic invertebrates have 
              planktonic larvae that  disperse through the water column  before returning to
              the sea bed to settle and develop into  adults.  An increasing body of evidence
              suggests that for  many benthic species dispersal and settlement are largely 
              passive processes of fluid-borne transport.  The coastal  ocean exhibits a
              unique set of physical transport  phenomena  that includes mean currents, tidal
              currents, and wave-  induced currents.  To gain a better understanding of the 
              effect that fluid transport has on dispersal and settlement  in the coastal
              ocean.  This research program will develop a  model of  passive larval
              transport along a vertical plane.  The effects of tides, waves, and mean
              currents will be  examined individually and in combination.    ***
