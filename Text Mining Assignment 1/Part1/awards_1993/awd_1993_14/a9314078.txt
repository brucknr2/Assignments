Abstract    :
              9314078  Conlon        This proposal is to partly fund a conference entitled
              "Hard Problems in  Mathematical Physics".  It is to be held at the University
              of Michigan on May  2nd, 3rd, 4th, 1994.  The meeting will feature up to 18
              fifty minute lectures  together with contributed posters.         The
              conference concentrates on problems and ideas in mathematics which  are
              motivated by intuitions from theoretical physics.  The unifying theme is  the
              renormalization group philosophy which emerged in the physics literature  in
              the 1960's.  It is a way of analyzing a physical system by comparing the 
              behavior of the system on different length scales.        Many apparently
              diverse problems have been analyzed within the framework  of the
              renormalization group philosophy.  Among these are important  technological
              problems of image reconstruction from radiation data -- in the  health field
              MRI and CAT scans, in the energy field detection of oil wells.   Another
              example is the analysis of signals propagating through a random medium  such as
              the ocean.  This is a way of determining average ocean temperature - a  key
              factor for environmental planning.        This conference is unusual in that
              most of the speakers have a deep  understanding of physics as well as being
              excellent mathematicians.  It should  motivate the mostly mathematical audience
              to interact with physicists and  other scientists for problems and ideas which
              are both mathematically  interesting and scientifically important.  ***
