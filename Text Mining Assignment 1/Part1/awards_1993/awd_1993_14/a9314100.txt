Abstract    :
              9314100  Lewis-Beck    This two-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative
              research in  political science between Michael S. Lewis-Beck and a research 
              group at the Center for Studies on French Politics at the French  National
              Center for Scientific Research.  The French principal   investigators are
              Daniel Boy, Jean Chiche, Gerard Grunberg, and  Nonna Mayer.  The objective of
              this project is the collection of  survey data that will allow the the
              principal investigators to  develop and test comprehensive models of voting
              behavior in  France and the United States.  The survey is timely, taking 
              advantage of the 1992 U.S. presidential election and national  survey, and the
              French national election in 1995.  Among the  items to be tested are:  party
              identification and economic  issues, such as personal finances.  This award
              supports Dr.  Lewis-Beck's travel to France and the costs of administering pre-
               test items for the French national election survey.    The project takes
              advantage of combined expertise in social  sciences and will provide access to
              national election data in  both the U.S. and France, which might not otherwise
              be made  available to scholars.  Comparative studies of national elections  in
              the western democracies and cross cultural analysis will  advance our
              understanding of voting behavior in the U.S. and  France.  ***
