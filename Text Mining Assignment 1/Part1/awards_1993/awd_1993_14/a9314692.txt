Abstract    :
              9314692  Dalgarno       This award is for support of the Institute for
              Theoretical  Atomic and Molecular Physics (ITAMP) at the Harvard/Smithsonian. 
              The ITAMP is the focal point for group activities in theoretical  atomic and
              molecular physics in the US.  The funds support a long  and short term visitor
              program, postdoctorals, graduate students  and topical workshops on various
              subjects of interest to the  atomic and molecular physics community.  ITAMP
              activities have  been instrumental in the revitalization of atomic and
              molecular  theory in this country.  ***
