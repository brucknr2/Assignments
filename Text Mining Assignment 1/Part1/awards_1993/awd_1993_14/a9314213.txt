Abstract    :
              9314213  Tibbitts    This workshop is aimed at bringing together researchers
              from various disciplines to outline the requirements for effective lighting of
              plants in controlled environment research. The meeting will outline and discuss
              the various requirements of plants for wavelengths from ultraviolet to
              infrared, problems in duplicating solar intensities, provide review of new lamp
              technologies including LED's and microwaves, discuss effectiveness of
              illuminaries, and procedures for reducing radiant heating. Specialists will be
              invited to make formal presentations and all attendees encouraged to
              participate in the discussions and workshops. The specific objectives to be
              addressed at this workshop will be:    i) in depth examination of the spectral
              and intensity requirements for the primary plant responses that are controlled
              by light    ii) discussion of the new technologies in lamps that would have
              usefulness for plant lighting    iii) review of the available and new
              technologies for distribution of light and control of excess infra red
              radiation    iv) development of guidelines for lighting of plants in growth
              chambers and greenhouses    The workshop is aimed at bringing together plant
              scientists and physical scientists to interact in the discussions. It will
              involve participation of plant scientists involved in studying mechanisms of
              light reactions and those involved in utilizing lighting for crop production in
              controlled environments. It will include participation of physical scientists
              from universities and government involved in research as well as those from
              industry involved in producing lamps and in constru ction of controlled growth
              facilities.       u    ~     @ EXE           @ j   P   PIFEDIT EXE           @
