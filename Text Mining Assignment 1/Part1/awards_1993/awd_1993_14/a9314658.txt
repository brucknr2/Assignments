Abstract    :
              9314658  Banerjee       The research will explore novel system architectures for
              the  next-generation optical networks, specifically wave-division- 
              multiplexing (WDM)-based reconfigurable, scalable, and modular  optical
              networks with arbitrary and regular structures.  The goal  is to provide
              flexible and cost effective sharing of the aggregate  optical communication
              spectrum, composed of a plurality of optical  fibers, among a large and
              scalable user population.  Specifically,  the investigator will study WDM-based
              reconfigurable, scalable and  modular optical networks with arbitrary and
              regular structures.  He  will also explore lightwave networks capable of
              supporting both  circuit and packet switched traffic covering a scalable 
              geographical region with optimized physical topologies.  ***
