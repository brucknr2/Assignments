Abstract    :
              9314454  Lowell    A key issue in understanding the chemistry of hydrothermal
              fluids  is the large observed variations in Chlorine. THe PI are guess that 
              phase separtion must play an important role. In this project, the  PI will
              attempt quantification of the processes responsible for  large varions in CI.
              He will modify a computational code (GEOTHER)  to model 2-phase flow in
              hydrothermal system at 9N (EPR).
