Abstract    :
              9314894  Platz  The generation of carbenes by photochemical methods and  
              reactions of these transient intermediates will be studied.   Experiments will
              be carried out to provide fundamental   information about the geometry,
              singlet/triplet energy   levels, heats of formation, and rates of intra-and  
              intermolecular reactions of carbenes. An emphasis will   placed on
              understanding the rearrangement of alkyl carbenes,   where low activation
              enthalpies and large negative entropies   of activation have been observed. In
              particular, the   possibility of tunneling as an explanation for the unusual  
              activation parameters will be pursued. The chemistry of   excited state
              diazirines will be studied in detail, since   these precursors to carbenes may
              mimic some of the chemistry   of carbenes. Several points along the reaction
              surface will   be characterized for the reaction of excited state   diazirines.
               %%%  This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the   continuing
              work of Professor Matthew S. Platz at Ohio State   University. Carbenes are
              high energy compounds which contain   only two bonds to other elements from
              carbon, while stable   compounds of carbon contain four bonds to other
              elements. In   a large number of reactions, carbene intermediates are  
              generated. The lifetimes of these fleeting intermediates   will be determined
              as a function of structure of the   carbene, solvent polarity, and temperature.
              These studies   will lead to a basic understanding of these important  
              intermediates and to their use in synthesis.  ***
