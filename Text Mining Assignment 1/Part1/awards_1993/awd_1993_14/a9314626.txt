Abstract    :
              Kinzler  9314626                                    Motivated by the concern how
              melting near sp/gt lherzolite  transition and  magma extraction processes will
              control major and trace elements in  magmas, the PIs propose a 4-step approach
              in this project to study  magma  generation processes at mid-oceanic ridges.
              The PIs will perform  simple  phase equilibrium experiments at 17-40 kbar,
              parameterize the  results,  use simple 2-D and 3-D transport models to examine
              how trace  element  abundances in magmas will be affected, and, finally, work
              out the  mass  and energy conservation of the models.
