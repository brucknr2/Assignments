Abstract    :
               9314824  Wood  The principal objectives of this high-risk project are to  test
              and refine two promising spectroscopic techniques for  use in hydrothermal
              studies of REE complexes.  The first  technique involves use of nuclear
              magnetic resonance  spectroscopy to study La chloride complexes using 139La
              over  a range of  concentrations, temperatures, and pH.  The  second technique
              involves pulsed photoacoustic spectroscopy  to study Nd and Er chloride
              complexes under similar  conditions.  Successful development of these
              techniques will  allow for rapid advances in characterization of high 
              temperature metal complexes, especially REE complexes, in  hydrothermal
              solutions.   The techniques will find  application in studies of REE mobility
              as relevant to  radioactive waste disposal, petrogenetic tracers,  development
              of REE resources, and the REE budget of the  oceans.
