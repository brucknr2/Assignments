Abstract    :
              9314412  Ramakrishnan    This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative
              research  among three research groups at the State University of New York, 
              Stony Brook, the CNRS' Research Center in Information Sciences, and  at the
              Nancy campus of INRIA (French National Institute for  Research in Information
              Sciences and Applied Mathematics).  The  U.S. investigators are I.V.
              Ramakrishnan, Leo Bachmair, and Jieh  Hsiang and the French investigators are
              Helene and Claude Kirchner  and Michael Rusinowitch.  The objective of their
              research is to  investigate the use of constraints in the design and
              implementation   of high performance deductive computing systems.  They will
              focus  on parallel automated deduction with constraints; methods for 
              fundamental operations in deductive systems and program analysis of  logic
              programs.    This project takes advantage of complementary expertise of the
              U.S.  and French groups. The U.S. investigators bring to this  collaboration
              their strengths in theory and application. The French  group at Nancy are
              considered leaders in software development as it  relates to term rewriting and
              constraints.  This investigation will  impact software design for high
              performance computing systems and  has important applications in logic
              programming.  ***
