Abstract    :
              9314133  McIntyre  This U.S.-Mexico award will support a collaboration  between
              Professor Laurence McIntyre of the University  of Arizona and Professor Eduardo
              Andrade Ibarra of the  Institute of Physics of the National Autonomous 
              University of Mexico (UNAM).  The collaborators will  study the (3HE,p) nuclear
              reaction as a tool for  materials analysis.     There are several major
              analytical techniques used in  the field of Ion Beam Analysis (IBA) for
              detecting and  quantifying elementary composition and depth  distribution in
              thin films and surface layers of bulk  materials.  The predominant and most
              general technique  involves nuclear scattering and reactions; however,  this
              technique shows a lack of sensitivity to low mass  elements in the presence of
              higher mass elements in  the film or substrate material.  Through the use of 
              the (3He,p) nuclear reaction, the present study will  search for additional,
              suitable techniques to overcome  this problem.  The experimental work will be
              divided  between the laboratories with the expectation that at  the end of the
              project, both labs will possess a new  and powerful technique for materials
              analysis.  ***
