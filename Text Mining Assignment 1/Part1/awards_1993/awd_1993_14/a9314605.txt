Abstract    :
              9314605  Greenblatt  Experience shows that materials with novel behavior are
              likely to  be discovered when competing electronic interactions exist. In 
              low-dimensional materials, the interplay of competing electronic  interactions
              is enhanced. The object of this project is the  synthesis and characterization
              of new reduced transition metal  compounds with quasi-low-dimensional
              properties. Systems of  interest include: (1) transition metal (Nb, Ta and W)
              bronzes and  (2) molybdenum, niobium, and rhenium cluster compounds. The focus 
              of the experimental program is to synthesize new materials of 
              strongly-correlated electron systems that are on the verge of  electronic and
              structural instabilities, and to fine tune the  competing electronic
              interactions through the unstable region in  a controlled way. Particular
              emphasis will be placed on the  preparation of single crystal specimens to
              study the structural  and orientation dependent physical properties. Single
              crystal  measurements of the electrical resistivity, magnetic  susceptibility,
              specific heat as a function of temperature, DTA,  ESR, FTIR, optical and XANE
              spectroscopies will be used to  characterize samples of interest. Structural
              and physical  property relationships will be stressed. Transitions associated 
              with the onset of charge density waves (CDW) and/or  superconductivity will be
              sought and characterized. These studies  are expected to yield novel materials,
              provide fundamental  insights into correlated electronic behavior and uHimately
              allow  the enhancement and control of electronic instabilities that lead  to
              interesting and useful macroscopic properties.  ***
