Abstract    :
                   This research concerns the nature of the well-known zeta                  
              function in number theory.  Carlitz has developed an analogue of               
              the zeta function and in joint work with Anderson, the                         
              investigator on this project has shown the values of this                      
              generalized zeta function are logarithmic and hence                            
              transcendental.  This research concerns the effort by the                      
              investigator to extend these results to general function fields.               
                   In general, this research explores various analogies between              
              number theory and geometry.  The research examines the prime                   
              factorizations of Gauss sums and the factorization analogues for               
              function fields.  For general function fields, the factorizations              
              do not follow the classical patterns for the field of rational                 
              functions.
