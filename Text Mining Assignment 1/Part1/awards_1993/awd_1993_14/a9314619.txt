Abstract    :
              9314619  Lomax    This is a SGER (small grant for exploratory research) award to
               obtain crucial preliminary data for the future investigation on  the
              mechanisms of interaction between the two plant hormones,  auxin and cytokinin.
               Auxin and cytokinin are two of the most  important plant hormones.  They are
              integrally involved in most  steps in plant growth and development.  There is a
              long history  of research in this area, however, as yet we know nothing about 
              how the two hormones interact with each other, how the ratio of  the two is
              measured by the plant, and surprisingly little about  the mode of action of
              either hormone. Recently, Dr. Lomax has  discovered that a mutant of tomato,
              the diageotropica (dgt)  mutant which is insensitive to auxin, has elevated
              cytokinin  levels as compared to wild type plants.  Dr. Lomax hypothesizes 
              that elevated cytokinin levels produce phenotypic effects which  mimic an
              auxin-insensitive phenotype. She proposes that expanded  studies on the
              biosynthesis and metabolism of cytokinin and the  regulation of auxin responses
              in dtg may yield significant new  insight into the interactions of these two
              important hormones.  This is an exploratory research into an important subject
              which  has not been amenable to more conventional approaches.  It is  expected
              that if successful, the results of this study may  provide an emerging
              opportunity to determine the mode of action  for both auxin and cytokinin.  ***
