Abstract    :
              9314512  Stott         This award will support a marine geological and
              geophysical study  of the California Current system and is a cooperative
              project  between scientists at Boise State University and the University of 
              Southern California. The main objectives of the project are to  acquire an
              extensive base of seismic reflection data and a suite of  large diameter piston
              cores and to use this new data to examine  changes in the current system over
              the last glacial cycle. the  results of the study will be correlated with
              similar work on land.  Additionally, the data to be acquired will be used in
              planning  drilling as part of the Ocean Drilling Program which will examine 
              the long-term evolution of the California Current in response to  changing
              Neogene climate conditions. The investigators on this  study are highly
              qualified and the project will take advantage of  close cooperation with a
              number of other groups engaged in studies  of the California Current.  ***
