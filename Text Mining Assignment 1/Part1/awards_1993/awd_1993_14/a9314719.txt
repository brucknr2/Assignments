Abstract    :
              9314542  Edmond    This award will support a collaborative study by Woods Hole
              and MIT  scientists of hydrothermal circulation at the TAG area on the Mid- 
              Atlantic Ridge. Instrumentation and sampling will be done at TAG  prior to
              Ocean Drilling Program drilling into the hydrothermal  system. Water column
              instrumentation will be used to measure the  change in total heat output from
              the system, while chemical  measurements on venting fluids will provide
              additional constraints  on changes in subsurface flow. This work being done in 
              collaboration with Japanese scientists who will provide the  submersible for
              the initial work. Work in the area subsequent to  drilling will be from the
              Alvin.  ***
