Abstract    :
              9314198  Xue      This project entails the study of air-sea interaction
              processes  along the Gulf Stream front off the North Carolina coast using a 
              three-dimensional ocean model and a two-dimensional (vertical  slice) coupled
              atmosphere-ocean model.  The work focuses on the  following specific
              objectives: (1) an investigation of the  evolution of the atmospheric and
              oceanic boundary layers associated  with passing winter cyclones; (2) to
              determine the relationship  between atmospherically induced oceanic motions and
              the regional  oceanic features, with emphasis on the Gulf Stream meanders; (3)
              to  demonstrate the air-sea coupling process during cold air outbreaks;  and,
              (4) to quantify the feedback effects on the mesoscale and  synoptic scale
              motions in the atmosphere and ocean.
