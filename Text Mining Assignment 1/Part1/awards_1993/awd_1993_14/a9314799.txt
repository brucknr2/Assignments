Abstract    :
                  9314799  Dahler    This Americas Program award will support Dr. John S.
              Dahler, of  the University of Minnesota, St. Paul in a research collaboration 
              with Dr. Hector I. Jorquera, of the Pontificia Universidad  Catolica de Chile. 
              The purpose of the research is to test,  modify and extend a new theory,
              developed by the two researchers,  of the flow characteristics of dense
              colloidal suspensions.   Numerical computations based upon this theory will be
              performed.   The theory will be used to predict other fluid properties such as 
              a suspension's viscoelastic response to time-dependent flows, the  rates of
              diffusion and sedimentation of the colloidal particles  and the spectra of
              scattered light and thermal neutrons.    Because of the technical complexity
              and subtlety of theoretical  research, progress in this field has been slow. 
              Therefore,  increasing understanding of the transport properties of these 
              materials would have an enormous technological impact in a number  of
              industrial fields, extending from biotechnology to mixing and  application of
              paint and concrete.  The complementarity of the  researchers expertise,
              analytic and numerical, is likely to lead  to progress in the field.  ***
