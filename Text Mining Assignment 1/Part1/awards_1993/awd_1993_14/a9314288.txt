Abstract    :
              9314288  Batiza       This project involves an ALVIN dive program at "Seamount"
              on  the East Pacific Rise near 12 degrees north.  Hyaloclastite  deposits will
              be sampled to evaluate the dynamics of  hyaloclastite eruptions with the
              objective of constraining magma  ascent velocity and plume dynamics for the
              high eruption-rate end  member of magmatic activity at ridges.  Modelling
              studies and  laboratory experimentation will also be employed.  ***
