Abstract    :
              Tivey  9314005    This study will apply a variety of techniques to characterize 
              samples taken from hydrothermal flange deposits. The PI will  determine
              porosity, mineralogy, texture and chemistry of pore  fluids and sulfur
              minerals. These data will be combined with  temperature and fluid composition
              measured by others, and used in  a computer model to quantify mass and energy
              fluxes. The project  should provide valuable insights into the formation of the
              flanges,  which are the best analog known for massive sulfide ore deposits.
