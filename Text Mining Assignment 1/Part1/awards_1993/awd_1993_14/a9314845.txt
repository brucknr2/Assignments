Abstract    :
              9314845  Gundersen    This two-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative
              research in  applied physics among research groups led by Martin A. Gundersen, 
              University of Southern California, Jean-Pierre Boeuf at the  University of
              Toulouse and V. Puech of the University of Paris,  Orsay.  The objective of the
              research is to study the applied  physics and applications of pseudosparks and
              back-lighted  thyratons devices.      The pseudospark is a promising,
              inexpensive high voltage switch  with possible environmental and semiconductor
              applications.  It  can be used for a range of scientific activities, including
              the  studies of the effects of beams on materials growth and as a  plasma lens
              for focusing high energy beams.  The U.S.  investigator is the innovator of the
              optically triggered  pseudospark and brings to this collaboration considerable 
              experimental expertise in pulsed power research.  This is  complemented by the
              French group's computational expertise and  their recent work in modeling of
              low temperature plasmas.  The  U.S. group will stress experiment and
              applications; whereas the  French groups will develop models of the underlying
              physics,  calculations of the basic properties, and conduct experiments 
              primarily related to switching applications.  ***
