Abstract    :
              9314377  Houston    This two year award supports U.S.-France cooperative
              research in  physical chemistry between Paul Houston, Cornell University, and 
              Francois Rostas of the Paris Observatory in Meudon.  The  objective of their
              research is to develop a tunable vacuum  ultraviolet (VUV) laser light source
              for the wavelength range  110-170 nm and its application to spectroscopy and
              dissociation  dynamics of carbon dioxide (CO2).  The laser is considered the 
              light source of choice and necessity for investigating photo-  dissociation of
              carbon dioxide (CO2) into carbon-oxygen and  oxygen at low wavelengths.  The
              U.S. investigator brings to this  collaboration extensive expertise in
              molecular dynamics,  especially in the area of photo-chemically laser
              dissociated  molecules.  This is complemented by the French investigator's 
              expertise in VUV spectroscopy of diatomic and small polyatomic  molecules of
              astrophysical importance.     Carbon dioxide is an important atmospheric and
              interstellar  constituent. In the earth's atmosphere, it has a profound effect 
              on the thermal balance.  It is also the principal constituent of  the
              atmosphere of Mars and Venus.  This project will advance our  understanding of
              its optical properties and its photochemical  processes.  ***
