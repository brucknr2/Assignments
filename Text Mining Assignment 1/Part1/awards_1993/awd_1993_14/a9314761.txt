Abstract    :
              9314761  Vasconcelos  This U.S.-Mexico award will support Professor Wolmer
              Vasconcelos of  Rutgers University in collaboration with Professor Rafael 
              Villarreal of the Instituto Politecnico Nacional in Mexico City.   The
              researchers intend to work on theoretical aspects of  commutative algebra and
              applied links to combinatorics and  computational algebra.  More specifically,
              the project will focus  on studying graded rings associated to ideals of
              combinatorial  interest, Gorenstein algebras, the Cohen-Macaulayness of certain
               toric varieties and the role they may play in the theory of Grobner  bases.   
              Both investigators are interested in central questions in  commutative algebra,
              particularly the aim of finding the solution  of, and detecting Cohen-Macaulay
              structure in, systems of  polynomial equations in a large number of
              indeterminates. The  investigators intend to carry out this research through
              e-mail and  telephone contact, by attendance to meetings and through a program 
              of regular visits that will involve graduate students and their  collaborators
              in other countries.  ***
