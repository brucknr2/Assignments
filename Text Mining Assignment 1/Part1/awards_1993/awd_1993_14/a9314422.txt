Abstract    :
              9314422  Gold    This three-year award, which supports  U.S.-France-German 
              cooperative research in inorganic chemistry,  involves four  laboratories in
              the U.S. and Europe. The principal  investigators  are:  Avram Gold of the
              University of North  Carolina; James  Terner of Virginia Commonwealth
              University;  Raymond Weiss of the  Universite Louis Pasteur in Strasbourg, 
              France; and A. X.  Trautwein, Director of the Institute of  Physics, University
              of  Lubeck in Germany.  The objective of  their research is to study  the
              effects of peripheral  substituents on the molecular and  electronic structure
              of  synthetic, high valent iron porphyrin.   The laboratories will  contribute
              complementary techniques towards  characterizing the  starting complexes and
              the high-valent  species.  The U.S.  investigators are experts in the
              synthesis,  generation, and  characterizations of these compounds using NMR 
              and resonance  Raman spectroscopy.  This is complemented by French  expertise
              in  synthesis and German expertise in x-ray  crystallography and 
              electrochemical studies.    The project will advance  understanding of high
              valent iron  porphyrin, which is an  important intermediary in the catalysis of
              enzymatic systems.   ***
