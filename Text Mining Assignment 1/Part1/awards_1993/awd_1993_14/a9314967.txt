Abstract    :
              The  proposed project  considers research on the  hypothesis  that  disfluencies
              in spontaneous speech - pauses,  repeated  words,   repairs,  filled  pauses, 
              word   fragments,    and  elongated  segments - are far from random and that
              knowledge  about  their regularity would shed light on aspects of human 
              cognition   and provide principled methods for dealing  with  them  in 
              spontaneous speech processing.   Several  relevant  disciplines  are  involved
              in this  effort  such  as  human-  computer   interaction,   linguistics,  
              psycho-linguistics,  computational  linguistics, prosody, and speech 
              technology.  The  multi-disciplinary approach includes investigating  the 
              forms  and distribution of disfluencies across many corpora,  conducting
              perceptual experiments to assess the saliency  of  specific  cues in the
              signal, and developing and  evaluating  new methods for automatic processing of
              speech.
