Abstract    :
              9314229  Sager    This award will support a detailed geological and geophysical 
              survey of the Shatsky Rise in the northwestern Pacific Ocean.  Existing data
              provide the basis for a model of Shatsky's formation  which indicates that it
              formed through coalescence of three  separate volcanic phases during initial
              melting at a mantle  hotspot. The cruise is designed to test this model and to
              provide  site survey data for a highly ranked drilling proposal submitted to 
              the Ocean Drilling Program. A major emphasis of the drilling  proposal is to
              examine the long history of carbonate sedimentation  on the Shatsky Rise which
              may record oceanographic conditions as  far back as the Jurassic.  ***
