Abstract    :
              9314316  Lahren       Within the Sierra Nevada batholith, the Mojave-Snow Lake 
              faults is a right-lateral shear zone with a proposed 400 km  displacement of
              Early Cretaceous age.  However the northward  continuation of the fault is not
              known in detail, but may involve  oroclinal bending and slip partitioning. 
              This continuation will  investigate selected areas in an attempt to find
              distinctive  geological features to define the location of the Mojave-Snow lake
               fault and evaluate the importance of oroclinal folding.  Results  will be
              applicable to regional reconstructions of the southwest and  may help develop
              general models of slip partitioning in magmatic  arcs.
