Abstract    :
              9314179  WELLS    The controversy surrounding iron limitation of phytoplankton
              in the  open ocean and its potential role in regulating global climate,  both
              in the present and past, has highlighted how little is known  about the
              speciation and biological availability of iron in  seawater.  Several new
              methodologies have been developed recently  that improve our ability to measure
              total iron concentrations in  "dissolved" and particulate fractions of
              seawater, however, none  address specifically the speciation of iron or its
              availability to  phytoplankton.  There is a tremendous need to gather together 
              chemists with theoretical and analytical expertise in iron  chemistry and
              biologists with expertise in the algal physiological  aspects of iron to: 1)
              establish the current level of understanding  of iron chemistry and the algal
              uptake of iron, 2) identify the  specific needs and research goals.  A small
              international workshop  comprised of both young and senior scientists to
              address this need  will be convened.  The objective of the workshop will be to
              foster  cross-disciplinary debate and studies towards developing the 
              analytical tools needed to better define the role of iron in marine 
              biogeochemical cycles and in the global system.
