Abstract    :
              9314751  Doser    This award will support the travel of Dr. Diane Doser from the
               Department of Geological Sciences at the University of Texas at   El Paso to
              spend one month each year over the next two years at  the New Zealand Institute
              of Geological and Nuclear Sciences in  Wellington conducting cooperative
              research with Dr. Terry H. Webb  on seismic studies of large earthquakes in New
              Zealand.    New Zealand is an active seismic region located along the plate 
              boundary between the Pacific and Australian tectonic plates.   Since 1915, 16
              earthquakes of magnitude >6.5 have occurred within  the country. This project
              will examine the faulting process of 10  historic earthquakes using seismogram
              modeling techniques.  These  models will be compared to geological and
              geophysical features of  the existing fault zones to better determine fault
              behavior, slip  rates, and regional variations in earthquake processes
              increasing  an understanding of deformational processes along complicated 
              plate margins like New Zealand and western North America. The  research is a
              collaborative effort between Dr. Doser, an expert  in seismological studies of
              historic earthquakes, and Dr. Webb  who has extensive knowledge of the recent
              seismicity of             New Zealand.
