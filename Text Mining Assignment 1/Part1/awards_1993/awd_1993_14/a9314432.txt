Abstract    :
              9314432  Starfield   This research project will develop a paradigm for
              simulating dynamics of ecological systems.  the paradigm models the different
              states of the systems separately, using the syntax of frames as borrowed from
              Artificial  Intelligence.  Within each frame, simple models (either numerical
              or qualitative) simulate the key processes for the corresponding ecological
              state.  "Demons" watch to see whether the assumptions underlying the definition
              of the state are transgressed, and if so, switch to a different model in a 
              different frame.  This approach greatly facilitates the process of building
              dynamic ecosystem models.  It makes it possible to rapidly test hypotheses, and
              leads to models that are  easy to understand and therefore facilitates the
              communication of ideas.  It also lends itself to models which include
              interactions between ongoing process (such as competition and herbivory and
              sporadic events (such as fires) at a level of resolution that is simple enough
              to comprehend but sufficiently complex to give informative unanticipated
              results.    %%%  Ecological systems are exceedingly complex  and ecologist 
              have been pursuing ways to model these systems in realistic ways.  This project
              is a substantial  contribution to the modeling approach using newly developed
              computer technology that is an interdisciplinary application of methods in
              Artificial Intelligence.  This approach could be a powerful means of
              understanding important issues, such as conservation of populations and
              habitats or long-term dynamic patterns such as climate change, in realistic
              ecological contexts.           &  ( u & G(` i M     &  G(  ) i M  "    &
