Abstract    :
              9314320  Neuhauser  Univ. Cal. Los Angeles  This project in diatom-diatom
              reactive scattering theory is supported by the NSF Theoretical and
              Computational Chemistry Program.  Exact, coupled-channel, state-to-state,
              quantum scattering, calculations will be carried out for gas phase reactions of
              diatomic molecules taking explicit account of all six degrees of internal
              freedom.  Improved computational methods will be developed, in particular,  a
              time-dependent and an equivalent time-independent flux-amplitude  method, use
              of absorbing potentials, and an improved filter algorithm for the accurate
              computation of eigenvectors whose eigenvalues lie within a selected range.  The
              first application of the theory will be to the reaction of molecular hydrogen
              with the hydroxyl radical.    This research project develops improved
              computational methods for predicting the detailed behavior of a very simple
              chemical reaction.  Rigorous quantum mechanical calculations will be carried
              out for a four-atom system.  The goal is to obtain a detailed and precise
              picture of the atomic events that occur.  This fundamental knowledge, which is
              difficult and expensive to extract from laser spectroscopy and other laboratory
              experiments,  provides detailed information that serves to test various
              simplifying mathematical approximations used for practical calculations for gas
              phase reactions of larger molecules.  The reaction of molecular hydrogen with
              the hydroxyl radical is itself of interest because it is an important step in
              the chain reaction that occurs during the combustion of hydrogen gas.
