Abstract    :
              9314611  Spiess    The investigators have installed sets of long lived precision
               transponders on the Juan de Fuca plate and on the Cleft segment of  the Juan
              de Fuca ridge. This program will re-survey these  installations during the
              summers of 1994, 1995, and 1996 to  determine the pattern of strain
              accumulation at the ridge crest and  the plate are moving relative to the
              Pacific and North American  plates.
