Abstract    :
                9314408  Huggins    Many luminous red giant stars eject significant amounts of
              material  from their outer layers.  The star then evolves rapidly into a  white
              dwarf while the matter is seen for a time as a planetary  nebula.  It is now
              known that the star and the visible nebula are  surrounded by a large shell of
              neutral gas.  The properties and  evolution of these shells will be studied by
              observing their  molecular emission at millimeter and sub-millimeter
              wavelengths.   This information will be used to develop a description of the 
              formation and evolution of the nebulae.  These studies should  substantially
              improve our understanding of this important but  little understood phase of
              stellar evolution.   ***
