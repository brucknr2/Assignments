                             9314140 Flierl  This proposal is directed to the study of the
              meandering and eddy production of western boundary currents, both in the case
              when they flow in mid-ocean (i.e. the Gulf Stream) and when they follow the
              coast (i.e. The East Australian Current).  While these motions are generally
              ascribed to instabilities of the flow, they generally occur in the form of
              pulses and develop both in space and time.  This project will address the
              linear and non-linear dynamics of pulses and other perturbations on jets.  The
              work will combine a number of analytical and numerical techniques.  The
              different perspectives offered by the various process models will complement
              each other to provide a more detailed picture of the dynamics.  The results
              will suggest new approaches for analyzing the oceanic data on meandering and
              eddy processes.     ***
