Abstract    :
              9314370  Barth    This project entails the use of a variety of observational 
              techniques, including rapid upper-ocean hydrographic surveying and  towed
              acoustic current profiler, to study the circulation in the  separation region
              of a baroclinic jet off central Oregon.  The  study seeks to determine: (1) how
              and why a strong alongshore  coastal current turns offshore, crosses steep
              topography and  becomes an oceanic jet; (2) how the structure, position and 
              vorticity of the jet vary downstream; and, (3) how the separating  jet is
              related to the coastal upwelling front.    ***
