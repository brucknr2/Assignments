Abstract    :
              9314697  Kleinrock    This award will support a field program and subsequent
              data  analysis to examine the relation between volcanism, tectonism and 
              hydrothermal activity in the TAG area of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.  The program
              will use Woods Hole assets (DSL-120 side-scan sonar and  ARGO system) to survey
              TAG segment. Objective is  to relate  hydrothermal mound-venting to local,
              segment-scale volcanic and  tectonic features, and to determine controls on
              hydrothermal  location. Work will be of benefit to interpreting results of 
              drilling which is scheduled at TAG by placing drilling in local and  regional
              context. Project is also important for joint ODP-  Interridge planning to
              evaluate impact of drilling on hydrothermal  system. Results will provide
              baseline study of "undisturbed" system  prior to drilling. Project is being
              jointly supported by Ocean  Drilling Program and Marine Geology and Geophysics.
