Abstract    :
              IRI-9314969  This  project intends to take advantage of the simplicity of  the 
              classical statistical trigram model of  language while augmenting  it  with 
              the syntactic and semantic aspects which constrain  the  use  of the new
              grammatical  trigram model to advantage over  the  purely   stochastic  model. 
              The concepts of  probabilistic  link  grammars are used in this research,
              incorporating trigrams into a  unified   framework   for   modeling 
              long-distance   grammatical  dependencies  in  computationally efficient  ways.
                The  methods  proposed  are  expected  to have greater  predictive  power 
              over  current  methods from the point of view of entropy  measurements,  and to
              integrate finite-state automata models and new statistical  estimation
              algorithms with modern powerful machines resulting  in  improved   speech 
              recognition,  translation,  and  understanding  systems.
