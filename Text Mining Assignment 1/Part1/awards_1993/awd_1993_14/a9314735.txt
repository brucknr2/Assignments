Abstract    :
              Form 7    Peer reviews were not required for this proposal  because it is an 
              Interagency agreement and a service agreement.  The National  Science
              Foundation (NSF) Proposal and Award Manual states in  section  122 .2.(B) that
              peer review is not applicable for "  services provided by another Federal
              agency in support of  Polar  Programs"   9314735  Petty  The Fish and Wildlife
              Sevice will further develop and test lipid  dosimeters or semipermeable
              membrane devices for use in  Antarctica.  The dosimeter is essentially a
              semipermeable plastic  tube containing triolein (a lipid).  The device is
              designed to be  placed insitu in water and simulate the uptake of contaminants
              by  aquatic biota. The contaminants in the lipid are extracted and  analyzed by
              conventional analytical methods. The advantages of  the technique are 1)
              deployment of the dosimeter is much simpler  than collecting aquatic biota;
              2)data between sampling locations  are comparable whereas data from different
              species are not;  3).  divers are not needed; 4) aquatic biota are not
              harvested; and  5). sample holding time are probably extend.  ***
