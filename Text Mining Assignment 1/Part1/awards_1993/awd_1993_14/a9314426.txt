Abstract    :
              9314426  Allara    This two-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research
              in  surface science between David L. Allara of Pennsylvania State  University
              and Francis Rondelez of the Institut Curie, Paris,  France.  The objective of
              their research is to investigate the  quantitative correlations between
              molecular structures in  monolayer assemblies of alkysiloxane films and
              conditions for  preparation of these films.  The correlations will be used to 
              determine film properties, in particular, surface wetting.   Parallel,
              independent experiments at Penn State and the Institut  Curie are aimed at
              determining the temperature for film  preparation; the role of substrate/film
              bonding in film ordering;  and the role of water in film formation.    The U.S.
              investigator brings to this collaboration considerable  expertise in organic
              thin films and molecular characterization of  their structure.  This is
              complemented by French skills in  synthesis and characterization of monolayer
              films.  Development  of stable molecular films with minimal defects is the
              ultimate  goal.  Such advances are important to scientific and  technological
              applications cutting across the disciplines of  physics, chemistry, biology and
              materials science.   Semiconductors, nanoscale lithography and optoelectronic
              devices  are among the leading technologies that would benefit from 
              improvements in structure of molecular films.  ***
