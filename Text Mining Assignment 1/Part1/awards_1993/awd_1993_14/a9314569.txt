Abstract    :
              9314569  Indurkhya    This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative
              research  in cognitive systems between Bipin Indurkhya of Northeastern 
              University and Marie-Dominique Gineste, Director of the Human  Cognition Group
              of the CNRS Laboratory for Computer Science and  Engineering.  The objective of
              their research is to empirically  investigate the cognitive processes
              underlying creative metaphors  and analogies.  The investigators hypothesize
              that certain  metaphors and analogies create similarities and that change of 
              representation underlies this process.  The investigators propose  to explore
              the process through joint experiments on perceptual  stimuli of geometric
              figures and verbal stimuli in the form of  written text.    The U.S.
              investigator brings to this collaboration significant  expertise in modeling of
              cognitive systems and artificial  intelligence.  This is complemented by the
              French investigator's  expertise in cognitive psychology and her empirical
              research on  analogy.  The research explores a new area in artificial 
              intelligence; that is, the generation of representations  underlying creative
              metaphors and analogies.
