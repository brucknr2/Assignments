Abstract    :
                9314794  Rose    This Americas Program award will support attendance of a
              group of  U.S. and Latin American scientists and graduate students to an 
              international  workshop on the  Santa Maria Volcano, Guatemala.  The  workshop,
              organized by Dr. William I. Rose, Michigan Technological  University, will be
              held in November, 1993 and will initiate a series of  collaborative research
              investigations, including volcanic hazard field  workshops and crisis
              simulations.      In 1902 the Santa Maria Volcano was the site of one of the
              largest  eruptions in historic times.  Through one of its vents, the volcano
              has  been consistently active since 1922, thus it is regarded as an excellent 
              site for direct observations and measurements during eruptions.  This  volcano
              has been designated a Decade Volcano by the International  Association of
              Volcanology and Chemistry of the Earth's Interior  (IAVCEI) as part of the
              International Decade for Natural Disaster  Reduction.    The many potential
              research topics arising from the  activity of this volcano will serve to
              attract scientists from all over the  world to work at this site.
