Abstract    :
              9314907  Chung       Calculations for ionization potentials, excitation
              energies,  fine structures, oscillator strengths and isotope shifts in  atomic
              systems of greater than four electrons will be performed  using the full core
              plus correlation method.  The computer code  will also be extended to treat a
              relativistic hamiltonian and the  program will be made user friendly and
              available to  experimentalists.  ***
