Abstract    :
              9314225  Franceschi      This award will provide travel support over the next
              three years  to enable Dr. Vincent Franceschi of Washington State University 
              to make yearly visits to conduct cooperative research with  Dr. John W. Patrick
              at the University of Newcastle in Australia.  The research will focus on the
              mechanism of sucrose unloading in   developing seeds. To understand how
              unloading is regulated, it is  necessary to analyze each step at the cellular
              and subcellular  level, and is best accomplished through a histochemical
              approach.    Specialized cells called transfer cells appear to contain the 
              biochemical mechanisms necessary for controlling sucrose  unloading. Antibody
              and cDNA probes will be used to further  characterize the transfer cells. This
              project will bring together  the physiological expertise of Dr. Patrick with
              the molecular  probes and techniques which have been developed by  Dr.
              Franceschi. Since crop yield is strongly affected by the rate  and pattern of
              import into storage regions of a plant, and  unloading is central to import,
              this research could have  significant practical importance in agriculture.
