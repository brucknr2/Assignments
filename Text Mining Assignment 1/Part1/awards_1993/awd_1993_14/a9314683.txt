Abstract    :
              We propose a broad-based program of research into the acceleration,  transport,
              and solar modulation of cosmic rays, the nature of  large-scale and turbulent
              magnetic fields in the solar wind, and  the interactions among these subsystems
              of the interplanetary  plasma.  Support is requested to continue the collection
              and  analysis of data from neutron monitor stations in Thule, Greenland  and
              Newark, Delaware.  Specific scientific objectives include:       o    detailed
              analysis and modeling of the ground level            enhancements caused by
              relativistic solar particles            during Solar Cycle 22;       o   
              comprehensive analysis of the higher order harmonics of            the cosmic
              ray diurnal variation, and the extraction of            new information on
              local interplanetary transport            parameters (including magnetic
              helicity) from the data;       o    detailed observational testing of new ideas
              as to the            factors governing cosmic ray mean free paths, including   
                      the influence of turbulence dissipation, dynamics, and           
              geometry; and       o    development and implementation of new observational   
                      methods to determine turbulence geometry, placing special           
              emphasis on the identification and measurement of a            possible
              two-dimensional component.
