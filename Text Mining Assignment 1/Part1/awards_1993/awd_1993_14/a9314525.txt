Abstract    :
              Felbeck  9314525    Free-living  and symbiotic bacteria at deep-sea hydrothermal
               vents use the sulfide formed  by geothermal processes as  an  energy  source
              for chemoautotrophic processes.  In order  to  describe   the   flow  of 
              carbon  in  a   vent   community,  information  is  required on how inorganic
              carbon  (CO2)  is  originally  incorporated into organic  compounds,  and  with
               which energy sources.  It's also important to understand the  mechanism  by 
              which  this carbon is eventually  transferred  from  vent  bacteria to rest of
              the community, in particular  the    hydrothermal-vent   tubeworm    Riftia   
              pachyptila.  Therefore,  this  project  will  focus  on   three  research 
              objectives:   (1) quantify the transport of CO2  as  organic  molecules in the
              blood R. pachyptila; (2) trace the fate  of  succinate, the molecule
              transferred from bacteria  to  their  hosts  as  well  as  the organic acid
              carrying  the  largest  proportion of external CO2 in the blood; and  (3) 
              determine  the   relative   importance  of  two  alternative   electron 
              acceptors  for sulfide oxidation, e.g., oxygen  and  nitrate  respiration in R.
              pachyptila.  The results of this  research  will  delineate  the  important 
              biochemical  pathways   and  mechanisms  involved in the synthesis of organic 
              matter  by  vent   communities,  which  is  central   to   understanding 
              chemoautotrophic processes at deep-sea hydrothermal vents.  ***
