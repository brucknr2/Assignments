Abstract    :
              9314607  Zannis    This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative
              research in  genetics between Vassilis Zannis of Boston University and Jean 
              Chambaz of the Department of Cellular Biology, Hotel Dieu.  The  Hotel Dieu is
              a major hospital located in Paris.  The objectives of  their research are to
              isolate and characterize the tissue specific  transcriptional regulators of the
              ApoA-II (apolipoprotein) gene  from mice.  The regulation of apolipoproteins is
              important since  they determine the cellular recognition and catabolism of 
              lipoproteins by cell receptors.  They also play a role in the  maintenance of
              cellular cholesterol homeostasis and in the  pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.  
               The U.S. investigator, who is a biochemist, brings to this  collaboration
              expertise in lipoprotein research, including  structure and function of the
              apolipoprotein and gene regulation.   This is complemented by the French
              investigator's expertise in cell  biology and gene expression.  The project
              also takes advantage of  a transgenic mouse facility at the Hotel Dieu where
              most of the  testing will take place.   ***
