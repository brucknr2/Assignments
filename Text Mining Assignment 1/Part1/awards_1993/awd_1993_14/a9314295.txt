Abstract    :
              9314295  Maris    This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative
              research  in condensed matter physics between Humphrey J. Maris, Brown 
              University, and Sebastien Balibar of the Ecole Normale Superieure  in Paris. 
              The objective of their research is to investigate a  broad range of nucleation
              phenomena in liquid and solid helium.   They propose experiments to study how
              bubbles form in helium when  the liquid is subject to a negative pressure, and
              how liquid  nucleates from the solid phase.      While the U.S. and French
              institutions have the basic facilities  for optical measurements at low
              temperature, each one has  specialized equipment and expertise.  The U.S.
              investigator  brings to this project considerable expertise in studies of  
              liquid helium and supercooled liquid hydrogen.  This is  complemented by the
              French group's expertise in solid helium, and  their ability to grow high
              quality solid helium crystals.  The  project will advance our understanding of
              the properties of  helium.  ***
