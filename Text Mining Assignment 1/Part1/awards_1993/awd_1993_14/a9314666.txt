Abstract    :
              9314666 Mital          The ease, quicknes, and economy of product manufacture
              are now considered by many in industry and academia to form the basis of modern
              manufacturing.  These criteria, when applied collectively on the design stages
              of a product, become known as Designing for Manufacturability (DFM).  The
              current DFM philosophy tends to overemphasize automation, of both the hard and
              flexible kind.  At  least two major problem arise when designers attempt to
              implement this philosophy in practice:  (1) hard automation does not lend
              itself to frequent changes in product design and (2) the cost of the automation
              option may be much greater rhan the cost of manual or hybrid option.         
              Ergonomics, which deals primarily with the application of technology tol assist
              the human element   in human work, has an important role to play in the product
              design process.  This workshop explores the role of ergonomics in the overall
              DFM philosophy and how it can assist designers more usuable, safer, reliable,
              and economical products. ***
