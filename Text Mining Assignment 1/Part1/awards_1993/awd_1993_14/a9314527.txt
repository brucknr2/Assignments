Abstract    :
                      9314527  O'Connor  The basic hypothesis of this research is that the
              practice of  constructability will be enhanced if a systems is available to 
              assist the user in conducting the analysis.  To test this  hypothesis the
              investigators will develop a decision support system  for the constructability
              analysis of industrial piping.  Computer  methods include a hybrid scheme
              consisting of  rule-based and case-  based reasoning for representing knowledge
              and a virtual reality  environment to serve as analysis and visualization
              platform.  In  addition to developing the system, this research will result in
              (i)  an investigation of the adaptations required to apply the computer 
              methods to the construction domain and (ii) definition of a  methodology for
              developing computer integrated construction  systems.  The first phase will
              identify the variables influencing   constructability and model the process in
              the form  of a decision  sequence.  The second phase will focus on the
              development of  schemes to represent the data and basic knowledge required for
              the  analysis.  In the third phase the representations will be  integrated with
              a virtual reality environment.
