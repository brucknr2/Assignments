Abstract    :
              Wilson  9314142    This project will refine the Cenozoic paleomagnetic lime
              scale to  minimize noise and remove spurious synchroneities in plate-pair  rate
              changes which are produced by the currently-accepted scheme.  This will be
              accomplished by (I) using plate-pairs with faster  rates, permitting more
              precise age estimates, for time intervals  with independent evidence that no
              rate changes occurred; (2) noise  will be removed by calculating rotation
              angles rather than average  distances; (3) ages will be determined from
              multiple plate pairs.  The result will be an improved time scale which will be
              widely used  in geologic studies, both continental and marine.
