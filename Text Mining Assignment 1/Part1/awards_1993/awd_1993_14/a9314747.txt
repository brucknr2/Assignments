Abstract    :
              9314747  Farvardin    This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative
              research  in communications and signal processing among three  investigators: 
              Nariman Farvardin of the University of Maryland;  Michel Barlaud of the
              University of Nice; and Patrick Sole of the  French National Center for
              Scientific Research in Valbonne,  France.  The objective of their research is
              to develop efficient  and powerful image and video compression signals by using
              wavelet  based methods.  The U.S. and French investigators will study the 
              problem using different approaches.  The U.S. investigator brings  to this
              collaboration expertise in perceptual image models,  trellis and structured
              vector quantization and combined source-  channel coding.  This is complemented
              by the French group's  experience in wavelet filters and lattice vector
              quantization  schemes.    The proposed research will advance our understanding
              of wavelet  based compression schemes and could lead to the development of 
              improved wavelet based image/video coders.  These coders have  numerous
              applications in medical imaging, geographical  information systems,
              video-teleconferencing, high resolution  television broadcasting, and archival
              and digital libraries.
