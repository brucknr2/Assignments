Abstract    :
              9314591  Cowen        Carbon and Mineral Fluxes from Hydrothermal Plumes: 
              Biogeochemical  Linkages with the Upper Water Column        Bioaccoustical
              surveys conducted near Endeavor Ridge over four  consecutive years have
              revealed intense non-benthic zooplankton  concentrations in a scattering layer
              immediately above the top of  the spreading hydrothermal plume at depths of
              1800 to 1900 m.  Most  exciting was the strong evidence for a 10 to 100 fold
              increase in  zooplankton biomass in a 50 to 100 m thick layer immediately above
               the top of plume.    This research project will examine the hypothesis that
              hydrothermal  venting markedly influences the vertical distribution and 
              composition of the zooplankton biomass beyond the limits of the  vent field and
              plume depths.  The project will use acoustic sensors  and photographic
              equipment in combination with simultaneous net  tows (1) to verify the
              distribution and composition of deep and  mid-depth zooplankton scattering
              layers in the vicinity of Juan de  Fuca Ridge in the North east Pacific; (2)
              determine the vertical  distribution and composition of "marine snow" and
              establish its  relation to the scattering layers; and (3) to investigate the 
              magnitude and characteristics of ascending material fluxes from the  plume
              depths.  The resulting data will be evaluated with respect to  the dynamics of
              potential carbon and mineral linkages between  hydrothermal venting and the
              deep and mid-depth ocean water column.  ***
