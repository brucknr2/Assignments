Abstract    :
              9314687  EMERSON      This study is t determine rates of net biological
              productivity and  respiration  in the oligotrophic ocean and the mechanisms
              that  control this process.  It is hypothesized that oxygen and carbon is 
              cycled at this location in which about two thirds of the net oxygen  
              production in the euphotic zone is accompanied by dissolved organic  carbon
              (DOC) production and one third by particulate carbon  formation.  Most of the
              DOC is respired immediately below the  euphotic zone (100-175m) and most of the
              particulate carbon escapes  the upper ocean.  Since DOM has a high C/N ratio,
              much less nitrite  is required to fuel the biological pump than suggested by
              the  "Redfield" ratio.  Dissolved nitrate appears to be taken up in the  region
              of oxygen  respiration below the euphotic zone.    This proposal is designed to
              test this hypothesis and study the  importance of short term transients of net
              biological O2  production. Continuous measurements of net biological  oxygen 
              production will be determined by deploying a device for in situ  measurements
              of total gas pressure and oxygen.  The hypothesis will  be tested by detailed
              simultaneous measurements of biological O2  production and dissolved organic
              matter at both Hawaii and Bermuda  U.S. JGOFS time series stations, and by
              determining the rates of  respiration and 15N-NO3 uptake below the euphotic
              zone.
