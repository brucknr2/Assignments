Abstract    :
              9314175  Lopez  This Americas Program award will support Prof. Hugo Lopez of the
               University of Wisconsin in a research collaboration with Prof.  Lorenzo
              Martinez of the Materials Laboratory of the Institute of  Physics of the
              National Autonomous University (UNAM) of Mexico.   The researchers will
              investigate the performance of an X-80 steel  in sour environments,
              particularly at temperatures above 100  degrees C.  They aim to obtain a full
              characterization of the  microstructure and strength of received and
              heat-treated steels,  and expose fracture-mechanics specimens to sour
              environments by  means of direct current electrical potential drop methods for 
              continuous monitoring of crack growth.    Steel microstructure characterization
              will be done at UNAM while  the U.S. side will focus on the continuous
              monitoring of crack  propagation rates under sour gas environments.  Expected
              outcomes  of this work include the determination of the influence of 
              temperature on steel resistance to sour environments, correlation  of steel
              properties and microstructural features with conditions  for crack growth and
              severity of damage, and further insights on  the role of alloying additions and
              steel strength on its  susceptibility to cracking under various testing
              environments.  ***
