Abstract    :
              9314583  Dorr    This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research
              in  interactive systems (human/computer) between research groups at the  the
              University of Maryland and the University of Narbonne,  Toulouse, France.  The
              U.S. investigators are Bonnie Dorr and  Martha Palmer, and the French
              investigator is Patrick Saint-Dizier.   They will collaborate on topics
              concerning lexical representations  for French and English.  The objective of
              their research is to  develop a conceptual description for thematic roles and
              argument  structures.  They will emphasize cross-linguistic distinctions and 
              the meaning components which are necessary for lexical selection  during
              machine translation.    Current machine translation systems encounter problems
              when  extended to new languages or domains.  This joint project will not  only
              advance our understanding of that problem, but is likely to  lead to a new
              lexical based framework that can be applied to  machine translation,
              information retrieval, and automatic lexical  acquisition.   The U.S.
              investigators bring to this collaboration  expertise in lexical-semantic
              representation.  This is complemented  by Dr. Saint-Dizier's theoretical work
              in computational  linguistics.  ***
