              (SHPE)  Title       :       National Student Leadership Conference        Since
              its inception, the National Student Leadership Conference  (NSLC) has served as
              a vehicle for developing within SHPE student  leaders the skills necessary to
              lead in the coordination of  successful chapter events.  SHPE student chapters
              officers from  across the country are brought together for three days of
              intensive  leadership, total quality management training and skill 
              acquisitions.  NSLC '91 was represented by 86 SHPE student  chapters; NSLC '92
              included 100 SHPE and Mexican American  Engineering Society (MAES) student
              chapters.    NSLC sessions are held throughout the US and past sites have 
              included the Pacific Gas & Electric Training Center in San Ramon,  California
              and Xerox International Center for Training and  Management Development in
              Leesburg, Virginia.    Typical course topics include:  Team Building,
              Situational  Leadership, Group Dynamics, Project Management, Effective
              Meetings,  Conflict Resolution, and Total Quality Management (TQM).  The 
              participants are divided into six tracks which enables them to be  scheduled
              for all two-hour sessions over the three days of  workshops.  The workshops are
              conducted by corporate  representatives who have been so impressed with the
              caliber of the  participants that they asked to be considered as trainers at
              any  subsequent NSLC.    The NSLC is supported by SHPE's Industrial PartnerSHPE
              Council  (IPC) which consists of 13 member companies.  They are:  3M, Amoco, 
              Apple Computer, Boeing Company, Chevron Corporation, Dow Chemical,  Eastman
              Kodak, Hewlett-Packard, Hoechst Celanese, IBM, Kraft  General Foods, Pacific
              Gas and Electric and Walt Disney  Imagineering.  Each one of these companies
              provides a minimum of  $22,600 to support all  of SHPE's educational programs. 
              The NSLC is  one of the six educational programs.  The IPC contribution to NSLC
               is $49,440 for 1993.    The NSLC 1993 will be held from August 19-22 at the
              Hickory Ridge  Conference Centre in Lisle, Illinois.  Scheduled workshop topics
               include:  Financial Planning, Leadership/Professionalism.  Project  manager,
              Effective Communications and Team Building.  Funding for  the event is
              requested for transportation and housing of the  student participants.  This
              proposal will be administered by SHPE  Foundation and coordinated by SHPE, Inc.
