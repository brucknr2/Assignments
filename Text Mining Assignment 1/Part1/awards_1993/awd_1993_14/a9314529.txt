Abstract    :
              9314529  Norlander    This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative
              research  in materials theory between Peter A. J. Norlander at Rice  University
              and Jean-Pierre Gauyacq and Dominique Teillet-  Billy at the University of
              Paris, Orsay.  The objective of their  research is to increase understanding of
              the dynamics of negative  ion formation in atom-surface scattering.  This
              investigation  will also include the study of effects such as the polarization 
              of the atom and the image force near a metal surface.    The U.S. investigator
              brings to this collaboration expertise in  surface theory.  This is
              complemented by the French  investigators' expertise in atomic and molecular
              physics.  The  project also takes advantage of two complementary, yet 
              contrasting methods for calculating energy shifts and the  lifetimes of atomic
              states which were developed respectively by  the U.S. and French groups. The
              development of a theory on how  atoms/molecules interact with surfaces is
              fundamental to our  understanding of processes such as catalysis and corrosion.
               This  project will advance that theory and the field of surface physics  in
              general.  ***
