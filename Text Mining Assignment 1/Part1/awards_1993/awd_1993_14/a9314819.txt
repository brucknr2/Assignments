Abstract    :
              9314819  Harlow  The goals of the proposed research are (1) to examine 
              experimentally the limits and parameters of K uptake in  clinopyroxenes from 5
              to 15 GPa and 1200-1700oC, (2) to  verify by x-ray diffraction, TEM, ATEM that
              K enters the  clinopyroxene structure and to characterize the structural 
              characteristics of this substitution, (3) to conduct  additional experiments
              with difference variance to produce  coexisting clinopyroxene and other phases
              in order to  examine K-amphiboles and K-rich minerals, and (4) to begin  to
              examine Ba uptake in calcic phases, as a divalent  analogue of K    The
              proposed study has relevance for  determining potential reservoirs of K in the
              mantle, which  is central to understanding the source of K in mantle-  derived
              rocks, mantle metasomatism, K recycling by  subduction, and the heat budget of
              the Earth.
