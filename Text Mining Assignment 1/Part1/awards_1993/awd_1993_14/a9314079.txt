              Astronomical Research with the Owens Valley Millimeter Array    This award
              supports research, technological development and  student  education at the
              California Institute of Technology's Owens  Valley  millimeter array. The array
              is made up of 6 precision 10.4m-  diameter antennas, which currently can be
              positioned out to  maximum  spacings of 220m north-south and 200m east-west.
              All the  telescopes  are equipped with dual-channel (2.6 and 1.3mm) cryogenic
              SiS  receivers. At the shorter wavelength, the highest angular  resolution
              attainable by the array is 1 arcsecond.  Approximately  50% of the array's
              observing time is presently devoted to  investigations by non-Caltech
              astronomers.    During the tenure of the past three year grant, the Owens
              Valley  array has obtained aperture synthesis images of molecular  emission  in
              domains ranging from the envelopes of evolved stars, to star-  forming regions
              in the Galaxy, as well as the spiral arms and  active nuclei of other galaxies;
              carbon monoxide emission has  been  detected in high redshift quasars and
              ultraluminous galaxies at  redshifts as high as 3.2. During the last grant
              period, the  observatory also made a number of technical advances, including 
              the  construction and placement in service of 3 additional antennas, 
              installation of new beam transport optics, implementation of  fully  remote
              receiver tuning capability, construction of a new digital  correlator and
              fiber-optic transmission and delay line system. In  the next three year grant
              period the observatory's scientific  programs will include studies of
              high-redshift galaxies and  protogalaxies, infrared-luminous galaxies, the
              large-scale  structure of the Universe, protostars and protoplanetary nebulae, 
              the structure of the Milky Way Galaxy, collimated outflows from  young stars,
              interstellar chemistry and a variety of solar system  objects. Planned
              technical developments in the 1994-1997 period  include the intr oduction of
              sideband separation receivers with  integrated first-stage IF amplifiers,
              doubling the interferometer  baseline, introduction of a second continuum
              channel for each  baseline, and the development and testing of low-noise stable
               radiometers on each telescope to measure and compensate for  short-  term
              atmospheric fluctuations in phase which reduce the  sensitivity  of the array,
              particularly over large baselines.
