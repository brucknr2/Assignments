Abstract    :
              9314639  Kapoor    One of the most important and basic industries for any 
              industrialized country is the "Machine Tool Industry".  Machine  Tools are not
              only the most basic foundation of any manufacturing  industry, but also one of
              the most reliable indexes of industrial  economy since the demand and supply of
              machine tools directly  relate to state of the industrial needs.  The U.S. has
              been the  leading country of machine tools in the world since World War II.  
              However, recently the U.S. is fourth in the world machine tool  production
              after Japan, Germany, and U.S.S.R.   The increasing  trends toward "integrated
              flexibility" in production systems  suggests future machining system must blur
              the boundaries between  "operation" and "operation planning", between "material
              handling"  and "material processing", and between "the so-call "agile 
              manufacturing" and "mass manufacturing."  An Industry/University  Cooperative
              Research Center for Machine-Tool System Research at the  University of Illinois
              - Urbana has been established to address  these issues.    The initial research
              agenda of machine tool system research Center  will address: 1.)
              system/planning and control; 2.) machine tool  structure; 3.) process
              development and innovation.  A new  initiative "SMARTCUTS" is to design, build,
              and test a future  generation machine tool system that represents a major step
              forward  in the advancement of machining technology.  Currently, there are  8
              company sponsors involved in Center's research projects and  committing
              approximately $340,000/year.      The Principle Investigator/Center Director
              and his colleagues at  the University of Illinois - Urbana have the knowledge
              and  facilities to run this Center.      The Program Manager recommends the
              University of Illinois,  Champaign be awarded $50,000 for the first year of a
              five-year  continuing award.      Near the end of each 12 month period the
              Program Director and/or  the Division Director of the Engineering Education
              Centers Division  will review the  progress of the Center on a number of
              criteria,  including the following: 1.) the extent to which the 
              university/industry interaction is developing; 2.) the extent  to  which the
              support base is developing; 3.) the extent to which a  robust research program
              is developing.  If the review is  satisfactory, the Program Director will
              recommend support for the  next period of this continuing award.
