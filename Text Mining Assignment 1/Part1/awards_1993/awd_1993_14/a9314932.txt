Abstract    :
              9314992  Zworski    This award supports a two-year collaborative  research
              project and joint seminar between  Professor Maciej Zworski, Department of 
              Mathematics, Johns Hopkins University, and  Professor Mitsuru Ikawa, Department
              of  Mathematics, Osaka University.  The project  focuses on various areas of
              scattering theory  and wave propagation.  It involves a series of  long and
              short term visits by U.S. and Japanese  researchers to Johns Hopkins University
              and  culminates in a bilateral seminar.  This  project is part of the
              activities of the Japan-  U.S. Mathematics Institute (JAMI) of the Johns 
              Hopkins University.       During the course of the project, U.S. and  Japanese
              researchers with diverse perspectives  will be brought together to discuss the 
              following topics:  resonances in various  settings, ranging from N-body
              scattering to  spectral theory of automorphic forms; inverse  scattering;
              nonlinear wave equations: long time  existence, formation of shocks, regularity
              of  bounded solutions, stability under non-linear  perturbation.  The project
              is also being  supported by the Geometric Analysis Program of  the Division of
              Mathematical Sciences, NSF.  ***
