Abstract    :
              9314660  Hilbish    This award supports a U.S.-France workshop on the
              evolutionary  genetics of marine bivalves to take place at two locations in 
              France:  La Tremblade and Sete, July 17-24, 1994.  The organizers  are Thomas
              J. Hilbish, University of South Carolina, Francois  Bonhomme, University of
              Montpellier and Andre Gerard, IFREMER  (The French National Institute for
              Research in Oceans and Marine  Sciences).  The objectives of the workshop are
              to: (1) acquaint  U.S. researchers with the facilities and resources available
              at  La Tremblade and Sete; (2) discuss the cataloging and  establishment of
              living genetic resources; and (3) explore topics  for collaborative research
              projects.  The specific topics for  discussion are: living genetic resources;
              molecular genetic  resources and questions related to molecular techniques; 
              genotype-environment interaction; and the breeding biology of  bivalves and its
              role in quantitative genetic analysis.    Bivalves are important model systems
              for the study of fundamental  issues in evolutionary biology.  They are
              particularly good  models of high gene flow systems.  The project brings
              together  U.S. and French investigators of complementary expertise. The 
              advantages to the U.S. investigators are significant. They will  have access to
              excellent French facilities in bivalve genetic  research and in molecular
              biology and to significant living  genetic resources.  ***
