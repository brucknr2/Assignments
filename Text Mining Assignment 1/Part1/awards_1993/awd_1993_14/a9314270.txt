Abstract    :
              9314270   Singh        The project seeks to develop a new and innovative method
              to  improve the adhesion properties of diamond films on carbide and  ceramic
              cutting tool materials.  It will employ an innovative  etching technique which
              will create a three dimensional  mechanically and chemically graded interface
              to distribute the  shear and thermal stresses encountered during the tool
              operation.   This process is expected to increase the adhesion strength
              compared  to other techniques.  Both surface modified sintered carbide  (WC/Co)
              and ceramic (Si3N4, whisker reinforced alumina) cutting  tools will be coated
              with CVD diamond using standard methods, and  a adhesion strength and turning
              tests will be conducted on these  samples.  The research will be carried out in
              collaboration with  industry.       The adhesion strength of diamond films to
              uncoated carbide  tools remains one of the most outstanding problems for
              application  of CVD (chemical vapor deposition) diamond in the cutting tool 
              industry.  If adhesion can be improved, the extensive application  of
              inexpensive, diamond coated tools in machining may be realized.
