Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A major effort in fisheries ecology has been to develop biochemical            
              tools for quantifying instantaneous growth rate and the nutritional            
              dynamics of recruiting fish larvae juveniles.  Recent studies have             
              lead to a succession of innovative techniques.  Due to problems of             
              interpretation with these methods, current trend in recruitment                
              studies is to use combination of biochemical, histological, and                
              morphometric techniques.  Thus, what is needed is a truly specific             
              biochemical indicator of the actual rate of cell growth at any                 
              point in time.  Recent advances in the biochemical regulation of               
              the cell cycle indicate that a protein kinase, Mitosis Promoting               
              Factor (MPF), acts as the "master oscillator" of the cell cycle.               
              Measurement of MPF activity suggest that MPF has tremendous                    
              potential as a highly specific measure of cellular proliferation               
              and growth.  To test this idea, DiMichele will develop analytical              
              techniques, verify the proportion of cells committed to mitosis in             
              asynchronous cell populations, and fit the theoretical model to                
              known whole animal growth rates in the red drum, Sciaenops                     
              ocellatus.  If the model is verified, the biochemical measurement              
              of MPF will have a tremendous potential as a specific measure of               
              instantaneous growth and cellular proliferation in heterogeneous               
              populations.
