Abstract    :
              9216783  Sheaff  This Science in Developing Countries Program  award supports
              travel expenses of U.S. and  Latin American physicists and doctoral students 
              to participate in a Workshop on High Energy  Physics, held in Rio de Janeiro,
              Brazil, in  January 1993.  Workshop organizers are Marleigh  Sheaff of the
              University of Wisconsin and  Alberto Santoro of the Centro Brasileiro de 
              Pesquisas Fisicas (CBPF) in Brazil.    The workshop is organized in conjunction
              with  collaborative projects associated with  experiments 769 and 791 conducted
              by Fermilab  and Brazilian high energy physicists.  Its aim  is to involve
              graduate students and junior  researchers in these projects and enhance their 
              background in high energy physics.  This  workshop is likely to produce
              benefits to all  participating countries by promoting science  education and
              the development of future  collaborative research ties.    ***
