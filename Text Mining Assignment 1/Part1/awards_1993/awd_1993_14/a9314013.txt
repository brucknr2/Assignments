Abstract    :
              9314013 Kelemen  In this project the PIs will extend their experiment of
              focusing of a melt flowing through a dissolving porous medium. Their
              experiments will include salt (sugar), water, glass balls, and they will heat
              these from the bottom. They wish to investigate the conditions under which flow
              focusing occurs in the absence of deviatoric stress. In their design water
              (variably saturated with salts) will be allowed to run through a flat interface
              with a column of glass balls+salt balls. They will also develop numerical
              models to simulate the experiments and scale them to the upper mantle
              conditions. A graduate student at MIT will mainly do this for her dissertation.
              The project will be coordinated between the PIs, the student thesis advisor,
              and Marc Speigelman (LDEO). ***
