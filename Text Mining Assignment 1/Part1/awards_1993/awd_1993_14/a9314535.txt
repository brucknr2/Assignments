Abstract    :
              9314535  Pittel  This Americas Program award will support Prof. Stuart  Pittel
              of the Bartol Research Institute in a  theoretical study of nuclear structure
              with Prof.  Alejandro Frank of the Instituto de Ciencias Nucleares  of the
              National Autonomous University of Mexico  (UNAM).    The investigators intend
              to study mapping methods to  provide reliable approximate treatments of
              multi-quark  hamiltonian systems.  Various approaches will be  tested in the
              context of an exactly solvable model of  quark systems that admits both two-
              and three-quark  correlations.  Exact solutions of this model problem  will
              also be used to extract useful insight on the  quark structure of real nuclei. 
              The proposed research  will benefit from the expertise of the U.S. 
              investigator in mapping techniques and their  application to quark systems,
              while the Mexican  investigator will contribute his expertise in group 
              theoretical methods in physics.  In addition, the  proposed work will involve
              various groups in Spain  that have been collaborating with the two 
              investigators over the past few years.   ***
