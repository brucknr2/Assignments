Abstract    :
              9314095  Rauch       This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative 
              research in applied mathematics between Jeffrey B. Rauch of the  University of
              Michigan and Guy Metvier of the University of  Rennes.  Other French
              investigators are J.L. Joly, University of  Bordeaux and Christophe Cheverry,
              also from the University of  Rennes.  The award will also support the
              participation of the  U.S. graduate students and postdoctoral researchers.  The
               objective of this research is to discover and analyze new  genuinely nonlinear
              behaviors.  They will study short wavelength  solutions of nonlinear partial
              differential equations of  hyperbolic type.  These equations model problems of
              wave  propagation.  Then they propose to construct approximate  solutions whose
              percent error tends to zero as the wavelength  tends to zero.    The project
              brings together U.S. and French investigators with  expertise in the area of
              partial differential equations and  mathematical analysis.  Their work on
              nonlinear behaviors will  advance our understanding of this area and also have
              important  applications to problems of nonlinear optics in laser physics, 
              which are crucial for the design of high energy lasers, and to  problems in
              compressible fluid dynamics.  ***
