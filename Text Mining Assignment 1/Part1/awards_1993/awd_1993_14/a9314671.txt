Abstract    :
              9314671  Nath    This U.S.-Polish Workshop on "Physics from Planck Scale to
              Electroweak Scale" will bring  together leading particle physics will bring
              together leading particle physicists from the U.S.,  Poland and other countries
              to Warsaw from 16-20 September 1993.  The workshop will  cover the forefront
              research areas of particle physics phenomenology, supersymmetry and  string
              theory.  This grant supports the participation of 12 U.S. participants, with
              Dr. Pran  Nath of Northeastern University as principal investigator.  There
              will be corresponding  support from the Polish side, with Dr. Tomasz Taylor as
              principal investigator, and Dr.  Stefan Pokorski, Director of the Institute of
              Theoretical Physics of Warsaw University as co-  organizer.      This proposed
              research in high energy physics fulfills the program objectives of advancing 
              science by enabling leading experts in the U.S. and Poland to combine
              complementary talents  and pool research resources in areas of strong mutual
              interest and competence.  The  workshop will also be used to promote the
              interest of graduate and undergraduate students in  particle physics.  ###
