Abstract    :
              9314421  Williamson  This U.S.-Argentina Cooperative Science Program award will 
              support the collaboration of Craig Williamson of Lehigh  University and Esteban
              Balseiro of the University of Comahue in  Argentina.  The project aims to
              investigate the impact of UV-B  radiation on high-elevation lakes in the
              southern Andes.    Loss of stratospheric ozone is resulting in global increases
              in  incident UV-B radiation.  Investigations of marine systems  suggest that
              naturally occurring fluxes of UV-B radiation can  harm water column processes. 
              Freshwater ecosystems may be more  predisposed to damage by UV-B radiation than
              marine systems, yet  little work has been done on UV-B radiation in lakes. 
              This  project's goals are to model UV-B attenuation in lakes;  investigate the
              possible impact of UV-B on the  chlorophyll-phosphorus relationship; and
              examine shifts in  zooplankton communities in lakes differentially affected by
              UV-B  radiation.  These studies will complement the U.S. group's  research on
              UV-B impacts in north termperate lakes and the  Argentine group's research on
              Andean lakes.  The results are  likely to improve understanding of the
              importance of UV-B  radiation in lakes, and will strengthen international 
              collaborations for future studies of the effects of UV-B  radiation on the
              environment.  ***
