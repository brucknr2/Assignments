Abstract    :
              9314465  Wang         The main objective of this study is to understand the
              growth  process of ice particles in clouds and precipitation.  The study  will
              investigate the growth of large particles where the particles  perform
              oscillating motions in air.  The PIs will study both the  diffusional growth
              and riming of ice particles in two contexts,  i.e., from both the individual
              particle and cloud dynamical points  of view.  To achieve the first goal, they
              will numerically solve  the unsteady Navier-Stokes equations for flow past ice
              particles of  various shapes and then use the flow fields so obtained to 
              determine the diffusional growth and riming by solving the  convective
              diffusion equations of vapor and the equation of motion  of supercooled
              droplets.  To achieve the second goal, they will  parameterize the results
              obtained and incorporate them in a cloud  dynamical model.  Finally, they will
              participate in the WISP94  experiment to collect real ice samples and use their
              models to  interpret the observation.  ***
