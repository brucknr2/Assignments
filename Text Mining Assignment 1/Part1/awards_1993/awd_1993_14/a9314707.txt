Abstract    :
              9314707  SARMIENTO    The overall objective of this work is summed up by the
              second of  the two major JGOFS goals: "to develop a capability to predict on  a
              global scale the response of oceanic biogeochemical processes to  anthropogenic
              perturbations, in particular those related to climate  change" (JGOFS
              International Science Plan, 1990). A major focus of  this work is the carbon
              cycle processes that determine air-sea  exchange of CO2.  Achieving these goals
              requires models of  biogeochemical processes as well as three-dimensional ocean
              general  circulation models (OGCM's) of physical processes. The physical 
              models are based on the primitive equation ocean model developed by  Brian,
              (1969). The biogeochemical model development effort is  divided into two parts.
               One focusses on the development of  ecosystem models of the euphotic zone.  To
              improve our  understanding of the processes that control the surface nutrient 
              content and how this is related to the carbon balance.  The second  effort
              focusses on transport of organic matter out of the euphotic  zone as dissolved
              organic matter and particles, and  remineralization of this in the deep ocean.
