Abstract    :
              9314315 Phipps  The Australian Antarctic Discordance is a section of mid ocean
              ridge that is significantly deeper than expected. This project will collect
              crustal thickness measurements from two neighboring segment in the Discordance
              has a median valley and a 1 km deeper axial depth than its neighboring
              Southeast Indian Ridge segment to the east that has an axial high morphology.
              Questions to be addressed are whether: (1) the Discordance is underlain by thin
              crust, (2) the Klein & Langmuir correlation of mid ocean ridge depth, crustal
              thickness, and major element chemistry is valid for the Discordance, (3) the
              crustal thickness on the adjacent Southeast Indian ridge differs from that in
              the Discordance, and (4) a magma lens exists under the Southeast Indian Ridge.
