Abstract    :
              9314616  Frederick  This project will develop a multi-year climatology of solar 
              ultraviolet radiation at the earth's surface for the high  latitudes of the
              Southern Hemisphere, poleward of 55os, and the  country of Argentina.  The
              spectral region of interest is 290 to  400 nm plus convolutions with action
              spectra of relevance to  marine biology and human health.  The time period
              addressed will  be 1979 through at least 1992, and later as new data become 
              available. The approach will be based on a numerical model of  solar radiation
              transfer using measured absorption and scattering  properties of the atmosphere
              as inputs.  Specifically, the Total  Ozone Mapping Spectrometer carried on the
              Nimbus 7 satellite  provides information on both column ozone and cloud albedos
              in  the near ultraviolet. Solar irradiance measurements from NSF 
              spectroradiometer at Ushuaia, Argentina and from the planned  Argentine
              radiation network will be used to evaluate and, if  needed, to improve the
              treatment of cloudiness developed from the  satellite data.  Special attention
              will focus on the time period  after the breakup of each year's Antarctic ozone
              depletion.  ***
