Abstract    :
              Eckman  9314694    The species composition of kelp assemblages and the 
              abundances of plants assemblages are influenced  significantly by two  major
              types of disturbance - attacks  on plants by herbivores, such as urchins, and
              forces imposed  on plants by moving water which may dislodge or break them. 
              These two forms of disturbance may interact significantly,  because sub-lethal
              mechanical damage of plants by herbivores  (a typical result of herbivore
              attack on larger sporophytes)  can weaken a plant's resistance to fluid forces.
              This study  will examine these effects by carrying out an extensive  series of
              measurements and experiments on kelps of several  species and morphs in situ,
              working at several sites along a  gradient of  flow energy in both the San Juan
              Archipelago,  Washington, and Barkley Sound, British Columbia. This study 
              will:  (1) make long-term measurements of current and wave  energy
              simultaneously at a series of permanent sites and  microhabitats within a site
              to characterize forces imposed  by seawater;  (2) measure probabilities of kelp
              mortality  and frequencies of sub-lethal damage of plants by  herbivores; (3)
              measure forces applied to kelps by flow; (4)  measure forces required to break
              or dislodge kelps, the  location of kelp failure, and the functional
              (allometric)  dependence of breaking force on plant size and shape; (5) 
              measure the variability in (2-4) among species, sites and  microhabitats, and
              (6) conduct experiments to determine the  impact of herbivores on breaking
              force and probability of  mortality.    ***
