Abstract    :
              9314502  Orcutt           The broad motivation for this study is to further 
              understanding of the relationship between the nature of the  seismicity (depth,
              mechanisms, spatial-temporal behavior), the  character of ridge axis
              morphology, and the generation of acoustic  T-waves along the Iceland-Svalbard
              plate boundary.  The recent  availability of several new seismic/acoustic data
              sets provides an  exciting opportunity for a well-constrained investigation: 
              the  Norwegian land-based seismic array data, the U.S. Navy hydrophone  array
              data, and detailed data on the plate geology and tectonics.
