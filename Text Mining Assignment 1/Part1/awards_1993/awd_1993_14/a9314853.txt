Abstract    :
              9314853  Housner    This award supports a two-year cooperative  research project
              between Professor George  Housner, California Universities for Research  in
              Earthquake Engineering (CUREe), and  Professor Yutaka Inoue, Department of 
              Architectural Engineering, Osaka University.   The award supports the travel of
              U.S.  scientists on the U.S. Panel on Structural  Control Research to Japan to
              meet with the  counterpart Japanese panel to plan, coordinate,  promote, and
              conduct research in the field of  monitoring and control of civil
              infrastructure  systems.  The joint efforts will also provide a  detailed
              research agenda that will be the  foundation for future U.S.-Japan cooperative 
              research projects.    The active control of seismic response of  structures can
              be described as a system to  modify from one instant to the next the dynamic 
              responses in buildings or civil structures  induced by an unknown external
              seismic  disturbance.  This is accomplished by providing  control forces to
              counteract the seismic  motions, or by changing the dynamic properties  of the
              structure so as to reduce the effect of  the ground shaking.  To achieve the
              foregoing,  the theory and analytical methods that will  form the basis of
              seismic control must be  established, and a comprehensive step-by-step 
              research program is necessary to examine  various methods and systems regarding
               performance and practical application to  structures.  Direction and
              coordination of  research in this field in a key requirement for  an effective
              R&D program.  U.S.-Japan  cooperation in a continuing exchange of  information
              will lead to new developments and  directions for research.  ***
