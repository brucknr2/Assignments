Abstract    :
              9314259  Webb    Webb Research Corporation is a small business that specializes
              in  design and construction of profilers and neutrally buoyant floats  for
              ocean science investigations.  The company will design, con-  struct, and field
              test six prototypes of a derivative Autonomous  Lagrangian Circulation Explorer
              (ALACE-B).  The primary focus will  be the development of a new CO2-based
              buoyancy generation engine  that will be simpler and lighter than previously
              employed mechan-  isms for controlling the drifter's depth.  ALACE drifters are
               neutrally buoyant instruments that drift at a precise pressure  gradient
              within the ocean.  They have the capability of carrying a  variety of
              scientific sensors.  By changing buoyancy, they can  ascend to the surface to
              telemeter data ashore, then change  buoyancy again to sink to their
              predetermined depth to make more  measurements.  ALACE-B is designed to operate
              in the upper 400  meters of the oceans and make up to 200 vertical excursions. 
               Isopyncal drifters, such as ALACE, comprise an important asset to  the ocean
              science research community, and the ALACE-B will provide  a new low-cost,
              upper-ocean capability that meets the scientific  requirements of a variety of
              planned research topics.
