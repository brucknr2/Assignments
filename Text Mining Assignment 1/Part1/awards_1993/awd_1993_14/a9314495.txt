Abstract    :
              ATM-9314495  Barnett  Univ. of Cal San Diego  Title:  Study of Global Climate
              Dynamics and Interdecadal  Variability    This is a two-pronged proposal aimed
              at i) explaining the dynamics  and thermodynamics responsible for the
              maintenance and seasonal and  interannual movement of the Indo-Pacific warm
              pool, and ii) the  space-time scales of interdecadal climate change and the
              physics  responsible for this variability.  The research will use a wide  range
              of numerical models, from simple to the most complex coupled  GCMs, and
              extensive sets of observed data.  Rigorous statistical  techniques will be used
              on the model/observed data sets to  elucidate the physics responsible for the
              simulated/observed  climate variability.  This research is important because it
              serves  as a foundation for examining the predictability of climate on a 
              variety of time scales.
