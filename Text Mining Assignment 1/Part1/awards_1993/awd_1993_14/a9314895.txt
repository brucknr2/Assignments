Abstract    :
              9314895  Evans    A one-week workshop will be held in July 1993 on the campus of
               the University of Minnesota for the purpose of helping  untenured young
              faculty members to develop successful research  relationships with industry, as
              well as developing productive  academic research programs.  The workshop will
              attempt to  share the technological management of the University of  Minnesota
              ERC on Interfacial Engineering with young faculty  from other Universities
              across the country and will help them  develop industrial as well as academic
              research  collaborations.  Mentors from the University of Minnesota will  be
              selected from faculty of a variety of departments:   Chemistry, Chemical
              Engineering and Materials Science,  Aerospace Engineering and Mechanics,
              Mechanical Engineering,  and Orthopedic Surgery.  There will continue to be
              mentor and  participant interactions for one year following the workshop  in
              order to assure that strategies for academic-industry  interactions are
              effectively pursued.  An evaluation procedure  for improving implementation of
              the program is part of the  overall program.  Two mentors will be drawn from
              other  universities.  ***
