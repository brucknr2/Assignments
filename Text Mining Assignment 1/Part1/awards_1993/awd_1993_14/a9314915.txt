Abstract    :
              9314915  Berkey    This awards supports a two-year cooperative  research project
              between Professor Frank T.  Berkey, Center for Atmospheric and Space  Sciences,
              Utah State University, and Professor  Takeo Hirasawa and Dr. Takayuki Ono,
              National  Institute of Polar Research (NIPR), Tokyo,  Japan.  The purpose of
              the project is to obtain  quantitative information on the spatial extent  and
              temporal development of auroras observed at  Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station.
                   The data to be analyzed have been acquired  using a film-based all-sky
              camera system that  has been operated at South Pole Station since  1965.  The
              data are to be processed using a  sophisticated all-sky camera image processing
               system developed at the NIPR for the analysis  of data acquired at the
              Japanese Antarctic  bases.  The analysis system enables the user to  display
              data in a geophysical coordinate  framework and to analyze images acquired over
               short or long time intervals in a manner not  possible with individual
              photographic images.   Dr. Berkey has responsibility for the all-sky  program
              at South Pole Station, and Dr. Hirasawa  and Dr. Ono have had extensive
              experience in  auroral studies, each having spent more than  one winter season
              in Antarctica.  NIPR is a  national laboratory responsible for conducting 
              research both in the Arctic and Antarctic  regions.  ***
