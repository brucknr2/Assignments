Abstract    :
              9314097  Ting       The behavior of the atmosphere in midlatitudes is strongly 
              influenced the sea surface temperatures in the tropical Pacific,  particularly
              during the periods of anomalous sea surface warming  known as El Nino.  The
              purpose of this research project to  understand what mechanisms are at work
              during these periods which  act to organize the higher frequency atmospheric
              motions,  particularly the role of the time mean flow.  A dry primitive 
              equation model, derived from a full general circulation model, will  be used
              for this study.  An idealized tropical heating anomaly,  representing the
              tropical signal during an El Nino event, will be  imposed on the time mean
              climatology.  Sensitivity of the  extratropical response will be tested by
              varying the location of  the tropical heating anomaly and by changing the time
              mean basic  states to which the anomaly is applied.  The results should provide
               insights into the what determines the organization of the  transients.  This
              research may provide a basis for improving  weather forecasting during El Nino
              events.  ***
