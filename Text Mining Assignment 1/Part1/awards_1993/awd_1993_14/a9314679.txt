Abstract    :
              Lonsdale  9314679    A pair of marine geophysical surveys, on each margin of the
               Pacific-Antarctic East Pacific Rise, will establish how this rise  lengthened
              by 2500 km during the Cenozoic, and how it produced  major offsets which define
              the large-scale segmentation of the  present spreading center. Existing data
              indicate that growth of the  rise was by creation and capture of risecrest
              microplates, rifting  of old oceanic lithosphere, and migration of triple
              junctions, so  the project will include investigation of these processes. 
              Principal survey tools will be a multibeam sonar, magnetometer, and  single
              channel seismic profiler.
