Abstract    :
              9314808  Conti  It has not been possible to observe the most massive stars
              shortly  after their births because they are shrouded in the dust and gas 
              clouds from which they formed.  However these clouds can be  penetrated using
              infrared radiation.  Infrared spectra (near a  wavelength of 2 microns) will be
              obtained for obscured objects in  star forming regions to identify the newly
              formed massive stars.   This will provide insights into the process of star
              formation and  help to understand star burst galaxies.  ***
