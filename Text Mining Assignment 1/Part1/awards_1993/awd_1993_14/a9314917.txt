Abstract    :
              9314917 Strickland  The main objective of this work is to develop computer
              analysis techniques for representing and analyzing large, multidimensional
              scalar and vector data sets generated by flow visualization experiments.  The
              fundamental premise is that complex flows can be decomposed into simpler,
              physically meaningful flow components, and that doing so facilitates computer
              assisted flow analysis.  Large 3D regions of the data will be segmented into
              smaller, computationally manageable volumes.  The interaction between the
              spatial distribution of critical points and the order of the nonlinear model
              will be studied.  Modeling techniques will be tested on experimental 3D vector
              field data.   Turbulent flows will be modeled using the tools of chaotic
              dynamical systems, namely fractals and iterated function systems (IFS).  The
              goal is to solve the classic inverse problem - given the image of a flow, or
              the velocity field, derive an IFS  from which reconstruction of the input data
              is possible. The dynamical systems models will be used for feature (e.g.
              vortex) identification, feature tracking in time sequences, and animation and
              visualization.  Data acquired from established laboratories will be used to
              test the modeling paradigms and their utility in flow analysis.  This work will
              address the needs voiced by he fluids, aerodynamics, and combustion and heat
              transfer communities concerning the automation of computer assisted methods for
              processing and interpreting large fluid flow data sets. ***
