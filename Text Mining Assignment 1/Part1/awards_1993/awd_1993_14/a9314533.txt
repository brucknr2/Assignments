Abstract    :
              9314533  Caron        The symbiont-bearing planktonic sarcodines (Acantharia,
              Radiolaria  and Foraminifera) are one of the most conspicuous groups of micro- 
              /macrozooplankton in the surface waters of oceanic communities.   They are also
              one of the least studied for their importance in  energy flow, nutrient cycles
              and vertical fluxes in these  environments.    Planktonic sarcodines play an
              important role in the production of  organic material by organisms >70 um in
              oceanic plankton  communities (via their intracellular symbiotic algae). 
              Moreover,  by virtue of their large size (and consequently their potentially 
              rapid sinking rates) they also play a greater role in the flux of  material out
              of the mixed layer than would be predicted by their  overall contribution to
              planktonic biomass.  Previous studies  indicate great variability in the
              surface productivity and flux of  sarcodine material out of the mixed layer
              that may be related to  the reproductive periodicities of some species of
              symbiont-bearing  planktonic sarcodines or to episodic events leading to rapid 
              population growth.  This project will test this hypothesis, and  determine the
              extent to which these periodicities control the  temporal changes in the
              importance of planktonic sarcodines to  primary production in the surface
              waters of the oligotrophic  Atlantic Ocean near Bermuda, and to their flux out
              of the surface  waters at this site.  ***
