Abstract    :
              9314690  Nerem  A Workshop on "Cellular Engineering"  is to be held September
              16-17, 1993  in Chester, England.  The purpose of  the meeting is to assess the
              current  knowledge of the emerging field of  cellular engineering and future 
              directions of research in this area.   An equally important outcome will be 
              the encouragement and possible  development of collaborative efforts  in the
              area between researchers in  the U.S. and the U.K.  ***
