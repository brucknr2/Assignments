Abstract    :
                9314787  Thorstensen    Our understanding of the orbital evolution, rotation,
              photometric  waves and emission line behavior in cataclysmic binary stars
              hinges  on observations of periodic variations in their brightnesses and 
              spectra.  Unfortunately, there has been little systematic effort to  measure
              these periodicities and link the photometric behavior with  the spectroscopic
              behavior.  The PI will collaborate with J.  Patterson of Columbia University to
              address this shortcoming.  The  PI will obtain large numbers of spectra while 
              Patterson will  collect photometric observations for many cataclysmic binaries.
