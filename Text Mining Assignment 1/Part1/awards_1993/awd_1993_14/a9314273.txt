Abstract    :
              9314273  Kotliar    This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative
              research  in condensed matter theory between Gabriel Kotliar, Rutgers 
              University, and Antoine Georges, the Ecole Normale Superieure,  Paris, France. 
              The objective of their research is to obtain  solutions to quantum many body
              problems in the limit of large  dimensions. They will analyze their findings
              with a view towards  understanding the properties of superconductors, magnetic
              liquid  helium 3, and photoemission of correlated metals.    The U.S.
              investigator brings to this collaboration expertise in  the solid state theory
              of interacting systems.  This is  complemented by French expertise in
              statistical mechanics in  general and in classical statistical systems in
              particular.  The  project will advance our theories underlying electronic and 
              magnetic properties of strongly interacting systems.  ***
