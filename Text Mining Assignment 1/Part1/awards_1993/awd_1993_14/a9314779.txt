Abstract    :
                9314779  Guignard-Spielberg    This Americas Program award will support Dr.
              Monique Guignard-  Spielberg, of the University of Pennsylvania, and Dr. Andres
               Weintrab, of the University of Chile, in a research collaboration  to design
              efficient solution methods for management problems in  North American and
              Chilean forests.  Medium to long range  integrated management decisions, such
              as timber cutting, building  of access roads, timber transportation, and
              others, must be made  in the presence of environmental constraints such as
              wildlife  habitats and cutting areas.  Research results will provide  foresters
              with better tools for devising efficient solution  methods in the face of these
              constraints and will advance the  state of the art in solving hard
              combinatorial programming  problems.     Efficient management of natural
              resources is becoming  increasingly important around the world and in Chile in 
              particular, with its strong forestry industry.  For this project,  the Chilean
              side will focus on heuristics and the design and  development of special codes
              intimately bound to the forestry  environment, while the U.S. side will
              concentrate on efficient  modelling, obtaining tight bounds on the integer
              optima via  Lagrangean techniques and designing Lagrangean heuristics.  ***
