Abstract    :
                                                  ABSTRACT        Proposal No.:  OEO93-14256 
              PI:            George Castro  Organization:  Society for the Advancement of
              Chicanos and Native                    Americans in Science (SACNAS)  Title    
                :  SACNAS 1994 Teachers Workshop Pilot Program    SACNAS, the Society for
              Advancement of Chicanos and Native  Americans in Science, proposes to hold a
              two week workshop for  science teachers to be held in the summer of 1994 on the
              campus of  Michigan State University or the University of California at Santa 
              Cruz.  The workshop will be a pilot program to extend the type of  teacher
              education that SACNAS has successfully carried out in the  past in the one and
              two day workshops that have been held  immediately preceding and in conjunction
              with the SACNAS national   conferences.  These workshops, which have typically
              used half a day  to cover one subject, have provided teachers of Chicano and
              Native  American students with curricula and training of many examples of 
              culturally relevant subjects that help increase the student's  desire to learn
              science.  The workshop presenters have been  research scientists and science
              educators who have researched the  contributions of indigenous peoples to
              science and have developed  methods to integrate them into the teaching of
              science.  The two  week program will allow the training to occur with much more
              depth  and interaction which will result in a more highly trained teacher  and
              which will provide the presenters the opportunity to improve  their material
              and presentation.  The pilot program will give  SACNAS presenters and
              organizers the opportunity to learn to work  with this more longer and
              intensive workshop and to overcome any  difficulties that may arise.  A
              successful summer Teacher Workshop  program will greatly increase the extent of
              the teachers who can  participate in SACNAS Science Teachers Workshops, which
              presently  can only accommodate those teachers living near the cities where 
              SACNAS holds its national co nference.  The cost of the pilot  program (77,888)
              will be shared by NSF ($45,272), SACNAS ($24,616)  and the host university
              ($8000).
