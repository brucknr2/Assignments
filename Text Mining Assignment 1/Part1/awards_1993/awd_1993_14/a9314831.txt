Abstract    :
              9314831  Wright   This Phase II SBIR project will performm research related to
              the production of fullerenes by the combustion synthesis method involving
              benzene fueled flames burning under rich conditions and reduced pressures. 
              Initial experiments have demonstrated the potential ability to produce
              commercial quantities of fullerenes by the flame synthesis process and have
              shown that the method can be more economical than the carbon arc process.   
              These tests, with an un-optimized apparatus produced fullerenes for 10 to 20
              per cent of the current cost of the arc process.  The Phase II objective will
              be to develop an understanding of the synthesis process so that the rate of
              production and yield can be improved.  The parameters to be optimized include
              temperature, pressure and equivalence ratio, using benzene as a fuel.  The
              effects of fuel structure and scale-up will also be investigated.  Concurrent
              with this applied study, a collaborative effort with the Colorado School of
              Mines, to develop a more fundamental understanding of the synthesis process
              will be undertaken.
