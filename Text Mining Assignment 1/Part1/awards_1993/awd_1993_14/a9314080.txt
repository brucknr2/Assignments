Abstract    :
              9314080      This Americas Program award will support Professor Gerta Keller  of
              Princeton University in a research collaboration with  Professor Jose Lopez
              Oliva of the Universidad Autonoma de Nuevo  Leon in Linares, Mexico.  The
              investigators intend to study the  Cretaceous/Tertiary (K/T) transition, which
              marks one of the  dramatic environmental changes in Earth's history, resulting
              in  the extinction of dinosaurs, invertebrates and marine plankton.    Current
              faunal, stratigraphic and mineralogic records suggest  that the biotic effects
              of the K/T boundary event were most  severe in low latitudes and negligible in
              high latitudes, that  there may have been multiple events, and that long-term
              oceanic  instability marked the K/T transition.  The researchers propose  to
              study whether the mass extinction was the result of a giant  earth-impacting
              bolide in the Yucatan region, whether the effects  of this impact were more
              severe or limited to low latitudes, and  whether there is evidence of long-term
              oceanic instability that  would suggest that the bolide impact was a temporal
              coincidence,  rather than the primary cause for the mass extinction.    For
              this work, laboratory based geochemical and quantitative  faunal studies will
              be mostly done at Princeton University,  whereas sediment and stratigraphic
              analyses will be largely done  at the University of Nuevo Leon in Mexico.
