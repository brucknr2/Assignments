Abstract    :
              9314071  Pegna  This proposal work will apply the emerging technology of
              Laser-induced Chemical Vapor Deposition (LCVD) to the fabrication of 3-D
              micromechanical devices.  The proposed work will involve modification of the
              planar LCVD process to fabricate 3-D objects at micro-dimensions.  The method
              will 1)pattern material into arbitrary shapes including internal features, 2)be
              used to fabricate an entire 3-D structure, 3)rapidly adapt to new products
              through the use of CAD tools, and 4)be applicable to a wide variety of
              materials.  ***
