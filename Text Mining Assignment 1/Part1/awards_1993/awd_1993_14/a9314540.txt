Abstract    :
              Henkart  9314540    This proposal requests continued support for the PI's
              activities  developing a computer-based seismic processing system (SIOSEIS).  
              The system is widely used throughout the community, who provide an  informal
              advisory committee.  The proposal describes improvements  in display and
              printing programs to be done in response to  recommendations by the committee. 
              Modifications will also be made  to existing systems in response to specific
              requests.  A feature of  the proposal is testimonials by users at nine
              institutions, who  state that the system is superior to commercially-available 
              packages.
