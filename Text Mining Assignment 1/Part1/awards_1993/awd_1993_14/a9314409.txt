Abstract    :
              9314409  Goldman  Relevant new theoretical research will be performed in support
              of  current ionospheric modification experiments.  The specific focus  will be
              on acceleration of particles and effects of spatial  nonuniformity in
              connection with strong Langmuir and ion-acoustic  wave turbulence excited in
              the ionosphere by an HF modifier.  The  new theoretical research has been
              motivated by airglow, incoherent  scatter, and barium release experiments
              performed during  ionospheric modification over Arecibo, PR.  The mean energy
              and moments of the velocity distriubtion of  electrons accelerated by strong
              Langmuir turbulence iwll be  computer after systematic development of
              appropriate and workable  theoretical acceleration models in one dimension. 
              Numerical  simulations will be based on modified versions of existing 2-time- 
              scale fluid codes, and will be calibrated against kinetic  simulations.  A goal
              will be to determine whether or not such  energetic electrons can account for
              the oxygenic airglowobserved  during ionospheric modification. The general area
              of theoretical  and computational research is Langmuir turbulence.  Research 
              performed under this grant is expected to be relevant also to  laser-plasma
              interaction physics and to beam-excited Langmuir  turbulence in
              naturally-occurring space plasmas.  ***
