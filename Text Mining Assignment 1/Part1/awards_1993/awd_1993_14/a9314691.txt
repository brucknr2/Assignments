Abstract    :
              9314691  DRUFFEL    The major goal of this continuing research is to construct
              time   histories of high-precision 14C in past surface ocean water regimes 
              using annual coral bands from fossil and living corals. These data,  when
              coupled with stable oxygen and carbon isotope measurements (18  O and 13C),
              reveal important information regarding the cycling of  14CO2 in the upper ocean
              and the exchange of 14CO2 between air and  sea.  Four experiments will be
              conducted 1) To determine whether  decade time-scale variations in 14C were
              present in ancient oceans  using fossil coral sequences that have been
              absolutely dated using  230 Th by thermal ionization mass spectrometry.  Two
              time periods  will be studied in corals from Vanuatu and from Biscayne National
               Park, Florida.  This will allow for the comparison of 14C in two  major ocean
              currents (the South Equatorial Current and the Gulf  Stream, respectively),
              during extreme thermal conditions that  existed in the Holocene: the Little Ice
              Age and the Hypsithermal.   2) To determine the presence or absence of decade
              time-scale  variations in 14C in the North Pacific during the late Little Ice 
              Age (AD 1680-1730), and compare this record to that obtained from  the
              southwestern Pacific where large 14C variations correlated with  ancient El
              Nino events.  Corals from the North Atlantic will also  be studied, to examine
              the extent to which the 14C variability was  world-wide.  3) The Suess effect
              (lowering of 14C due mainly to  14C-free fossil fuel CO2 since late 1800s) will
              be measured at  three sites in the northern Pacific, where no measurable Suess 
              effect was found 4)Collection and high-precision 14C analyses are  proposed for
              a coral from Fernando de Noronha.  The equatorial  Atlantic is presently the
              only location in the temperate and  tropical oceans for which a post-bomb 14C
              record is not available.  Its importance for parameterizing tracer penetration
              into the  Atlantic cannot be overstated.  A limited number of high-precision 
              14C analyses will b e made using Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) 
              techniques, with multiple graphite target analysis for each sample.  The
              remainder of the samples (75%) will be measured to high-  precision at the UCI
              Radiocarbon Laboratory using conventional,  gas-counting techniques.
