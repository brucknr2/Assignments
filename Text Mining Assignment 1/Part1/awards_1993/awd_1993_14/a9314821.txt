Abstract    :
              9314821  Fink  This Seminar will be a successor to those presented in 1988 
              (which was jointly sponsored by NSF, EPRI, and the Engineering  Foundation),
              and in l991 (which was jointly sponsored by NSF and  ECC, Inc.), and will be
              addressed to the same audience.  However,  in view of the strong international
              interest and participation in  the previous seminars (19 in 1988, 18 in 1991,
              from Europe, Asia,  and Australia), it is proposed to hold this next on in
              Europe.    The purpose of the Seminar will be to discuss the best current 
              understanding of voltage phenomena on large scale electric power  systems, in a
              way that will be helpful both to the experienced  power system engineer seeking
              to cope with the new phenomena  which his system is experiencing, and to the
              academic  investigator seeking to probe deeper into those phenomena.  The 
              Seminar is intended to enhance understanding of the phenomenal  involved, to
              stimulate research and development on algorithmic  tools adequate to the needs
              of the industry, and to encourage  advancement of the state of the art in
              practical applications.  A specific emphasis in this Seminar will be technology
              exchanges  between young university professors and post-doctoral fellows, 
              through explorations of basic phenomena and state-of-the-art  analytical
              techniques.  This has been a major function of this  Seminar since its
              inception.  This is demonstrated by the 1988  and 1991 sessions, with
              international technical exchanges  initiated at and continuing after the
              sessions, particularly as  they have provided opportunities to young
              investigators.  The  previous sessions have included participation by
              investigators  from Australia (University of New South Wales), Belgium 
              (University de Liege), England (Imperial College, London),  Germany (Aachen
              University of Technology), Italy (Politecnico di  Torino, Universita di Bari),
              Japan (University of Tokyo, Meiji  University,Kawasaki, Hiroshima University,
              University of Tokyo,  Waseda University, South Korea (Seoul Natio nal
              University), and  Sweden (Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm).  In all.
              over  a dozen young graduate students and assistant professors attended  these
              sessions.  ***
