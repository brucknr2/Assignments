Abstract    :
                9314515  O'Brien         In this project, the PIs will establish a Data
              Assembly Center  (DAC) for surface meteorological data, and extend efforts in
              their  specical Analysis Center (SAC) for surface fluxes.  Focus will be  on
              surface meteorological measurements collected by buoys and ships  during the
              field period of the World Ocean Circulation Experiment,  and providing the
              data, as well as derived forcing fields to other  participants in the program.
