Abstract    :
                  Howe  9314379    This U.S.-Brazil Cooperative Science Program award supports
               field expenses and purchase of a computer for statistical  analysis, to be
              performed on site by M. Pacheco, a Brazilian  graduate student working on his
              doctoral dissertation.   The  study is being developed in  the reserves of the
              Biological  Dynamics of Forest  Fragments (BDFF)  project, an  association
              between the Smithsonian Institution of the  U.S.A. and  the Brazilian National
              Institute for Amazon  Research (INPA).  In order to complete his work, Mr.
              Pacheco  will spend 400 days in the Amazon forest.  The grant also  provides
              for travel expenses to Brazil for H. Howe, Mr.  Pacheco's adviser, who will
              visit him once, to advise him  and to supervise his research.    Mr. Pacheco
              will perform research to evaluate the influence  of several classes of factors
              on the distribution and  abundance of two tropical palm tree species in the
              Amazon  forest.  One of the species grows preferentially on flood  plains,
              while the other one's preferential habitat are  plateaus.  By studying these
              closely related species, the  research will attempt to distinguish between the
              effects of  abiotic (water, light, etc.) and biotic (predation,  infections,
              etc.) factors on the spatial distribution of the  two species.  Understanding
              of these effects will help in  predicting the response of tropical tree species
              to changes  in the regional or global climate, and to human related 
              activities.  It will also contribute to the understanding of  the kind of
              tropical biology required in conservation and  restoration efforts.    ***
