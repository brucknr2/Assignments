Abstract    :
              9314455  Wilkins    This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative
              research  in condensed matter physics between John W. Wilkins, Mebarek  Alouani
              of Ohio State University and Christian Brouder of the  University of Nancy and
              LURE (the French Laboratory for the  Application of Electromagnetic Rays).  The
              objective of their  research is to study the long-range interaction that causes
               magnetic ordering in transition-metals and rare-earth compounds  by using
              circular magnetic x-ray dichroism (CMXD). CMXD is a new  spectroscopy with
              potential of providing information of the  magnetic properties of a broad range
              of magnetic systems.  The  proposed research on a theoretical approach and
              calculations will  advance CMXD technique and development.    The U.S.
              investigators bring to this collaboration theoretical  expertise and their new
              numerical codes.  This is complemented by  French group's adaptation of
              multiple-scattering theory to these  problems and the excellent experimental
              facilities at LURE.
