Abstract    :
              9314695  Webb  Funds are provided to modify and upgrade a suite of general
              purpose  oceanographic instruments that are used in long-term deployments on 
              the sea floor.  The Marine Physical Laboratory at Scripps Institu-  tion of
              Oceanography maintains a number of adaptable, instruments  to record seafloor
              seismic and other signals for intervals of many  months at high data rates.    
               Modifications will involve the development of three component,  broad band
              sensors for obtaining long-period surface wave records  from the seafloor.  The
              short period geophones in the existing  ocean bottom seismometers (OBS) are
              useless for surface wave  studies because of poor sensitivity and high
              self-noise at periods  longer than 10s.  This limitation may be overcome by
              installing  displacement sensors on the OBS geophones.  A modified sensor is 
              planned that is more than 50 dB quieter than the standard sensors  and will be
              adequate to readily detect Love and Rayleigh waves.     Studies of the
              propagation of Rayleigh and Love wave using arrays  of seafloor instruments
              will provide important information on the  structure of the oceanic mantle. 
              The new displacement sensors will  be installed in ten existing OBS's.  Once
              upgraded, this suite of  instruments will be capable of long-term deployments
              required of  experiments such as those proposed in the Global Change RIDGE 
              program and other individual research projects.   ***
