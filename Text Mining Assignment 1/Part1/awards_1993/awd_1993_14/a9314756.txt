Abstract    :
              9314756  Nerem  This conference will focus on recent  advances in Tissue
              Engineering.  It  will be held concurrently with a  conference on "Biology of 
              Physicochemical Interactions at the  Cell Surface".  In addition to the 
              opening keynote address, these two  conferences will have three other  joint
              sessions focusing on basic  principles.  The first of these will  explore how
              cellular interactions  and extracellular matrix influences  cell function and
              tissue modeling:  the second, on biomaterials, will  discuss currently
              available methods  for fabricating artificial tissue  scaffoldings and new
              approaches for  synthesizing novel attachment  substrates using biological 
              molecules; and the third will focus  on concepts in the regulation of 
              biological activity by mechanical  stresses.  In addition, there will  be a
              series of five sessions  directed towards recent experiences  in the
              development of organ-specific  tissue-engineered biological  substitutes.  ***
