Abstract    :
              9314587  MOORE    This research project will use short lived radium isotopes to 
              determine the ages of freshened waters as these waters move and mix  from the
              coastal zone into the open ocean.  These techniques should  enable marine
              scientists to tract the movement and mixing of  coastal waters on time scales
              of a few days to several weeks. These  studies will provide important
              information on the coupling between  the coastal ocean and the ocean and the
              ocean interior. When  combined with other studies, these techniques will enable
               oceanographers to assess fluxes of materials across the density  gradient
              separating freshened coastal waters from the rest of the  surface ocean.  This
              work is based on a new measurement technique  for short lived Ra isotopes, 224
              Ra (half life = 3.6 days) and 223  Ra (half life = 11.4 days). Most of the
              effort will be devoted to  technique development and verification initially. 
              Field Studies  will then determine (1) the rate at which the freshened river
              plume  of the Mississippi River intrudes into the Gulf of Mexico and (2)  the
              rate of mixing from near coastal waters across the inner and  mid shelf region
              of the south Atlantic Bight.
