Abstract    :
              9314077  Souganidis    This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative
              research  in applied mathematics between the Center for Mathematical  Sciences,
              University Wisconsin and the University of Paris-  Dauphine.  The U.S. team
              leader is Panagiotis E. Souganidis, and  his French counterpart is Pierre-Louis
              Lions.  Their research is  in the general area of nonlinear, partial
              differential equations  and mathematical analysis.  This project emphasizes
              variational  problems, fully nonlinear elliptic equations, kinetic theory of 
              conservation laws, generalized front propagation and mathematical  models in
              finance. Taking advantage of complementary expertise in  almost all these
              areas, the investigators will form small groups  to address modelling,
              theoretical and numerical analysis as  applied to practical cases.  These
              problems have important  applications in theoretical physics, mechanics,
              biology,  chemistry and finance.  ***
