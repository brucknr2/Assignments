Abstract    :
              9314106  Lerch  This Americas Program award to the American Physics Society
              (APS)  will help to support a hemispheric meeting of physics societies in 
              Cancun, Mexico.  The meeting, which has been organized by the APS,  the
              Sociedad Mexicana de Fisica (SMF), and the Canadian Association  of Physicists
              (CAP), represents a major first step in a plan  designed to strengthen
              collaboration among all the physics  communities in the western hemisphere.   
              The conference is the first trilateral meeting of physics societies  and
              furnishes an opportunity to consolidate links with other  physics societies in
              the hemisphere, including the Federacion  Latinoamericana de Sociedades de
              Fisica (FELASOFI), an umbrella  organization for Latin American physics
              societies.  At the same  time it will help to advance current plans of the APS
              and the SMF  to develop an expanded directory of physics programs in the 
              hemisphere, to appoint representatives to subcommittees of the  sister society,
              and to develop closer collaboration in educational  programs.  Furthermore, by
              bringing together physicists from the  hemisphere and from Europe to
              participate and report on their work  in thirteen broad areas, the meeting will
              provide an opportunity  for the exchange of knowledge and the initiation of
              collaborative  projects.  The Physics Division and the Division of Materials 
              Research are cost sharing in this international award.  ***
