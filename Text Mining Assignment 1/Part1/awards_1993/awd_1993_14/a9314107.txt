Abstract    :
              9314107  Vossoughi  This award will provide partial support for the 13th
              Southern  Biomedical Engineering Conference.  The conference will be held  at
              the University of the District of Columbia in April 1994.  The  award will help
              support keynote speakers, student awards, student  assistants and miscellaneous
              costs.  The conference has a long  history.  By hosting the conference, the
              University of the  District of Columbia, a Historically Black University, will 
              receive greater visibility in the Biomedical Engineering  community.  In
              addition, the students at the university will  benefit directly, both through
              employment and participation.  ***
