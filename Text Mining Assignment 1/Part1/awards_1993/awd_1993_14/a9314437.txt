Abstract    :
              9314437  Seferis    This award provides funds to permit Dr. James C. Seferis, 
              Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Washington, to  pursue with
              Dr. Ki-Jun Lee, Department of Chemical Engineering,  Seoul National University,
              Korea, for 24 months, a program of  cooperative research on autoclave resin
              transfer molding (ARTM)  in high performance polymeric composite recycling. 
              Specifically,  the proposed research will focus on (1) ARTM feasibility studies
               and process development, (2) resin flow modeling and processing  parameter
              characterization, (3) void formation phenomena in ARTM  processing, and (4)
              ARTM composite recycle studies.  This project  will be integrated into an
              overall processing-structure-property  characterization methodology
              facilitating composites technology  transfer in aerospace, automotive, and
              electric/electronic  industries.    Composite recycling has recently emerged in
              aerospace industries  as a critical issue resulting from serious concerns for
              cost  savings and environmental health problems.  The expertise of  Dr. Lee's
              team at Seoul National University in polymer rheology  and porous media
              transport phenomena will be combined, for mutual  benefit, with that of the
              PI's research team which is studying  process induced stresses in laminated
              polymer composites and  related problems in composite manufacture.  The
              collaborators are  recognized as experts in the field of the proposal.  This
              project  is relevant to the objectives of the U.S.-Korea Cooperative  Science
              Program which seeks to increase the level of cooperation  between U.S. and
              Korean scientists and engineers through the  exchange of scientific
              information, ideas, skills, and techniques  and through collaboration on
              problems of mutual benefit.  Korean  participation in the project is supported
              by the Korea Science  and Engineering Foundation (KOSEF).  This project adds an
               international cooperative dimension to the PI's research under  NSF Grant No.
