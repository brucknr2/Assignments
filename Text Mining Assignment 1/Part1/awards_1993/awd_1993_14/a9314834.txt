Abstract    :
              9314834  Snyder    This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative
              research  in computer and computation research between Wayne Snyder, Boston 
              University and Pierre Lescanne of the CNRS' Center for Research  in Information
              Sciences and INRIA (The French National Institute  for Information Sciences and
              Applied Mathematics).  The objective  of the research is to develop more
              powerful theorem proving  programs using completion and paramodulation-based
              techniques.   They propose to investigate applications of paramodulation and 
              completion developed at Boston University and in France.  They  will also
              undertake the development of a new version of ORME (a  term-rewriting software
              system currently used in France).     This project takes advantage of French
              expertise in term-  rewriting.  The U.S. investigator will use the French
              developed  software, ORME, for testing his ideas.  He brings to this 
              collaboration expertise in integrating methods of theorem proving  with those
              of term-rewriting.  The proposed research will advance  the use of
              completion-like techniques in software engineering.  ***
