Abstract    :
              9314897  Chen  SLG resolution, Linear resolution with Selection for General
              logic  programs, is an effective method of query evaluation for deductive 
              databases.  It is upward compatible with Prolog.  This project  extends SLG
              resolution into nonmonotonic reasoning, develops an  efficient implementation
              of SLG resolution, and integrates it with  Prolog.  The objective of this
              effort is to deliver an integrated  system that supports logic programming,
              deductive queries, and  nonmonotonic reasoning in a seamless manner.  The
              proposed  implementation uses newly developed techniques of incremental 
              maintenance of goal dependencies to improve its efficiency of  deductive query
              processing.  It supports computation of three  valued stable models in
              nonmonotonic reasoning.  It offers  constructive negation for negative goals
              with constraints or  variables.  By providing a uniform programming interface
              and  powerful integrated query answering, the proposed system minimizes  the
              mismatch between application programming and knowledge  processing and
              increases the productivity in developing knowledge  based software.
