Abstract    :
              9314210  Frankel    The American Association for the Advancement of Science
              (AAAS) will organize and  conduct an invitational workshop on evaluating
              scientific research for scientists, engineers,  research managers, science
              policy analysts, and policy makers from Eastern Europe, the  United States, and
              several Western European nations.  The workshop will convene in Poland  on
              October 8-11, 1993, and will be co-sponsored by the Polish Society for the
              Advancement  of Science and the Arts and the Polish State Committee for
              Scientific Research.  It is the first  of a series of workshops planned by the
              AAAS over the next four years on the scientific  freedom and responsibility
              issues likely to emerge in Eastern Europe.  The workshop topic  relates closely
              to prevalent concerns in Eastern Europe pertaining to professional autonomy 
              and accountability.  It also has implications for determining research
              priorities, resource  allocation, and career development and mobility.  All of
              these matters assume heightened  significance among the countries of Eastern
              Europe as they experience a period of  contracting budgets for science.    The
              workshop agenda will focus on: 1) assessing the use of quantitative techniques
              and  indicators for evaluating scientific research and scientists, 2)
              exchanging information about  the operation of peer review mechanisms, and 3)
              examining related ethical issues raised by  use of peer review and quantitative
              techniques in formulating funding and personnel decisions  in science.  Through
              this workshop the AAAS hopes to encourage the emergence of an  international
              network of scholars, scientists and policy makers who can draw upon each 
              others experience to help strengthen the scientific and technological
              infrastructure in the  countries of Eastern Europe.  Among the expected
              outcomes will be publication of the papers  and proceedings of the workshop,
              both in a volume published by AAAS and in select  journals.
