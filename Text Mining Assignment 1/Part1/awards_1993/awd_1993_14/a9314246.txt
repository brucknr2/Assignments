Abstract    :
              9314246  Brown    This two-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research
              in  condensed matter physics between Stuart Brown, University of  California,
              Los Angeles, and Denis Jerome, University of Paris,  Orsay.  The objective of
              the research is to study the magnetic  and transport behavior of materials
              related to a quasi one  dimensional molecular salt known as Bechgaard salt. 
              Hydrostatic  pressure will be used.     The U.S. investigator will conduct the
              characterization studies  and provide the samples.  The pressure-NMR
              measurements will be  done in Orsay.  This project takes advantage of the
              complementary  expertise of the French investigators in NMR measurements and 
              provides access to excellent high pressure NMR facilities in  France.  ***
