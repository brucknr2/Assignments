Abstract    :
              9314793  Wake  This award will support major improvements to the Recent
              amphibian and reptile collection in the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology,
              University of California-Berkeley, which is one of the nation's largest and is
              a fundamental international and national resource in teaching and research in
              biodiversity and biological disciplines.  The improvements coincide with a move
              of the collections to new, modern facilities in a Life Sciences Building that
              the University has renovated at a cost of $80M-$120M.  The renovation has
              achieved a 48% increase in space for all collections. The support will provide
              cabinets and tanks to replace inadequate old cases and to alleviate crowding,
              and student assistants for packing and unpacking the collection.  %%%  The
              herpetological collection in the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology, University of
              California-Berkeley is internationally recognized in its importance to
              systematic and ecological research.  It is a fundamental resource in
              biodiversity studies and education. This support will enable the collection to
              be moved to newly renovated facilities and rehoused in modern cabinets that
              will ensure its conservation for future generations of students and
              researchers.   ***
