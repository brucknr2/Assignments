Abstract    :
              9314209  Kenney        This award provides support for a mathematics conference 
              designed primarily for undergraduates.  The goal is to introduce  students to
              the community of mathematical scholars through a  series of student and faculty
              lectures accessible to audiences  with a broad range of experience and
              expertise.  Special efforts  will be made to ensure an agenda which includes
              activities  focusing on first and second year students who may not have had 
              exposure to higher level mathematical concepts.        The principal speaker,
              Professor John Conway of Princeton  University, while renown for his
              mathematical erudition, also has  an international reputation as a speaker and
              advocate of  mathematics to the general public.  Additional speakers, faculty 
              and students from the host institution and nearby colleges, will  also address
              the conference. It is expected that this activity,  perhaps the first of its
              kind, will be repeated on a continuing  basis.   ***
