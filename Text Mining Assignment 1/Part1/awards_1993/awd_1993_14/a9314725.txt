Abstract    :
              9314725  Christensen  This is an award to support research to find effective 
              methods for determining the sources of diffuse aquatic  pollutants.  The
              investigator plans on developing a chemical  mass balance model and factor
              analysis models for analyzing  sedimentary records of pollutants including
              consideration of  errors in both the measured historical record of a substance 
              and its known source functions. The models will be evaluated  using existing
              data sets for sediment-associated deposits of  polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
              in existing dated sediment  cores and polychlorinated biphenyls in sediments
              from  freshwater Lake Michigan estuaries.  In addition, an  experimental
              program will be conducted focusing on  polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and
              polychlorinated dibenzo-  p-dioxines in Lake Michigan, Green Bay and the lower
              Fox  River of Wisconsin.    The goal of this project is to develop
              source-attribution  methods for potential use in management of aquatic water 
              quality.  These methods, previously extensively used in  characterizing sources
              of air pollutants, may prove  especially effective in dealing with non-point
              sources of  pollution.  While point-sources of water pollution are  generally
              readily identifiable, non-point sources such as  those attributable to
              deposition from the atmosphere are  not.  Results of this research are expected
              to lead to  improved models that can be utilized in engineering design  of
              pollution control facilities and remediation of polluted  aquatic resources.
