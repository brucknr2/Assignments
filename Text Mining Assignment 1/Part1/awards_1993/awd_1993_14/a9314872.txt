Abstract    :
              9314872  Sorooshian    This two-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative
              research in  hydrology between research groups at the University of Arizona, 
              led by Soroosh Sorooshian, and the Remote Sensing Laboratory in  Montpellier
              under the direction of Alain Vidal.  The objective of  their research is to
              analyze data from several international  field experiments, and integrate the
              data with hydrologic models  that focus on the transfer of heat and moisture in
              temperate,  arid and semiarid regions.  The experiments include the Monsoon 
              '90 experiment, sponsored by NASA, USDA-ARS and USGS, the  CNES/NASA
              multi-aircraft campaign and the hydrologic-atmospheric  pilot experiment in the
              Sahel.    Fluxes of moisture and energy between the land surface and lower 
              atmosphere are key components to understanding atmospheric  processes and
              climate.  The proposed multidisciplinary data  analysis of ground-based
              measurements and remote sensing  observations at different geological sites
              could lead to models  which are applicable to a range of conditions and sites. 
              The  project takes advantage of the complementary expertise of the  U.S. and
              French teams in analysis of remotely sensed data and in  hydrologic modeling.
