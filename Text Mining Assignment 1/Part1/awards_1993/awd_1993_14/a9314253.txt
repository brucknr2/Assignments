Abstract    :
              9314253  Hajek       The principal investigator (PI) will focus on performance 
              evaluation and design of communication networks of the future with  emphasis on
              large, high-speed networks, both optical and  electronic.  The main topics are
              1) Spectral Response of Queues and  Diffusion Approximation, 2) Continuous
              Traffic in Packet Switches,  3) Multirate Circuit Switches, and 4) Optical
              Interconnections.       The approach will be to perform modeling, analysis, and
               design.  Models will be based on current and anticipated future  technology
              and cover a broad spectrum of networks with  circuit-switched to datagram
              packet networks at the extremes.   Analysis will consist of a mixture of exact
              probabilistic methods  and simulation.  Design will be motivated by modeling
              and analysis  and aided by optimization tools of both combinatorial and linear 
              types.  Finally, inequalities from information theory, mathematical  physics,
              decision theory and combinatorics will be applied to yield  new performance
              bounds, providing a bridge between design and  performance evaluation.      
              Successful completion of the proposed research would provide  new network
              topologies and control strategies for high performance  networks, improved
              means to predict performance to support the  offering of guaranteed service,
              and techniques to extrapolate  accurately performance observed for small
              experimental networks to  large-scale networks.   ***
