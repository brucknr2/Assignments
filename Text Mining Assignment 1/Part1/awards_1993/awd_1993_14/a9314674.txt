Abstract    :
              Broecker  9314674    The potential of osmium isotopic ratios of marine sediments
              as a  geochemical tracer was demonstrated by Pegram et. al. (1992).  They 
              showed that there has been a large increase in the 187 Os/186 Os  ratio of
              osmium leached from Pacific red clays over the past 58  million years.  They
              proposed that the leachable osmium is  hydrogenous in origin, and reflects the
              isotopic composition of sea  water at the time of precipitation.  The observed
              change in 187  Os/186 Os was attributed to changes in continental weathering 
              rates; higher values corresponding to increased supply of  radiogenic 187 Os
              via rivers.  The presumed short residence time of  osmium in sea water
              potentially allows it to respond to rapid (<10  Ka) changes in weathering
              rates.  At present, no tracer with this  capacity exists.    Since osmium
              isotopes have not been homogeneous in the oceans in  the past, inferences drawn
              from the record at a single site do not   necessarily apply to the whole ocean.
               However, the heterogeneity  of osmium in the oceans may facilitate evaluation
              of the importance  of local changes and their effect on mean ocean water
              chemistry.      This study will evaluate the spatial and temporal variability
              of  osmium in sea water by analyzing the hydrogenous (leachable)  fraction of
              marine carbonate sediments and elucidate the processes  that control osmium
              isotope ratios in the oceans on various time  scales, and thus help to lay the
              groundwork for the use of osmium  as a tracer for these processes.
