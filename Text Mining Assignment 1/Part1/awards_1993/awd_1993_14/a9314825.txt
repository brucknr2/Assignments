Abstract    :
              9314825  Mukherjee  The purpose of this research is to investigate the 
              phenomenon of superplasticity in an important class of  structural ceramics,
              i.e., nitride ceramics.  This is a  collaborative investigation leading to a
              comprehensive  framework connecting powder consolidation and formation of 
              micrograined high density nitride ceramics to fabrication  processes based on
              superplasticity.  A major theme of the  research is the understanding of the
              mechanisms of  superplasticity in submicron non-oxide ceramic materials. 
              Scientific paradigms relevant to superplastic response in  non-oxide ceramics
              are developed by focusing the research on  pure and doped aluminum nitride
              (AIN) and silicon nitride  (SiN) and without fluxing additives. Both of these
              important  nitride ceramics will be consolidated by a Plasma Activated 
              Sintering (PAS) process very recently pioneered in Japan and  demonstrated to
              achieve high densities in very short  sintering times.  %%%  In this
              increasingly energy-conscious industrial age,  ceramics are in the forefront as
              materials destined for use  as high temperature structural materials.  They
              have the  potential for finding their place in gas turbine engines in 
              propulsion systems and also in terrestrial power plants.  Superplasticity
              brings the additional attractive feature of  being a near net-shape forming
              process, with significant  saving in materials and machining costs.
