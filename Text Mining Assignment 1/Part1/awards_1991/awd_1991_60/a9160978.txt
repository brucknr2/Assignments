Abstract    :
                   Computed tomography (CT) has become increasingly                          
              important in nondestructive evaluation (NDE).  Industrial                      
              applications often require very high spatial resolution.                       
              However, the finite width of x-ray sampling limits the spatial                 
              resolution.  Research to be carried out here will investigate                  
              an efficient computational method to deconvolve the beam width                 
              from the projection data without increasing the noise in the                   
              reconstructed image.  Previously, long computation times                       
              and/or high noise have made deconvolution techniques of little                 
              value in CT.  A matched filtering deconvolution method will                    
              increase resolution without increasing noise and will be                       
              computationally quick and easy to implement.
