Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to use plasma induced                         
              polymerization for the preparation of new High Performance                     
              Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) supports.  Monomers will be                       
              polymerized on silica surfaces to form thin, pin hole free                     
              chromatographic supports whose silanol sites are                               
              deactivated by the polymer coating.  Other rigid supports,                     
              such as alumina, will be evaluated with the objective to                       
              prepare alkali stable chromatographic supports.                                
              Chromatographic evaluations will be performed using both                       
              small molecule and large molecule standard probes.                             
                                                                                             
              The above process, unlike conventional silane bonding,                         
              does not require a large chemical facility, or the use of                      
              large quantities of reactants and wash solvents, or long                       
              reaction times.  In addition, the resulting novel                              
              chromatographic supports should have better separation                         
              efficiencies with improved stability, reproducibility, and                     
              be scaleable from analytical to preparative separation                         
              modes.
