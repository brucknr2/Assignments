Abstract    :
                   Quality x-ray optics will be a key factor in the success of               
              x-ray imaging applications such as lithography, x-ray                          
              lasers, x-ray microscopes, and x-ray spectroscopy.  Multi-                     
              layer lamellar gratings and phase patterned x-ray optics would                 
              offer advantages in spectral resolution, spatial resolution, and               
              power efficiency over current x-ray optics used in these                       
              applications.  The production of reflective phase structures will              
              require innovative schemes for fabrication.   This                             
              research will develop a fabrication process suitable for phase                 
              structures based on processes used in the semiconductor                        
              industry.  The method utilized will be suitable for the                        
              fabrication of phase gratings with periods of less than .2m or                
              the limits of lithographic resolution.  The feasibility of this                
              method will be shown by making large scale (5 square cm.)                      
              multilayer phase gratings of .3m to .8m periodicity, which will              
              be characterized on the Brookhaven synchrotron.  The                           
              experiments will determine the feasibility of making gratings of               
              less than .2m periodicity.  The processes developed under this                
              proposal will be directly applicable to fabricating other phase                
              structures such as zone plate x-ray lenses.
