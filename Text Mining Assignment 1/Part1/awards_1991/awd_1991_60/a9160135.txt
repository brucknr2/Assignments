Abstract    :
              This project is aimed at a fundamental                                         
              reexamination of the Monte Carlo approach,                                     
              which is the current state-of-the-art, to estimate                             
              hurricane winds for the Gulf and Atlantic                                      
              Ocean of the United States.  The significance                                  
              of wind engineering information produced in                                    
              the measurements and analysis of recent                                        
              hurricane events, improved data bases, and                                     
              basic modeling approaches will be investigated.                                
              The feasibility of developing an improved                                      
              hurricane prediction methodology will be                                       
              examined and the limitations of the approach                                   
              will be scrutinized by detailed research on each                               
              element of the model.  Expected benefits from                                  
              this study are more reliable estimates of the 50                               
              and 100-year return period hurricanes                                          
              windspeeds and directional characteristics.
