Abstract    :
              The pollution control field is in need of an efficient, cost-                  
              effective in situ treatment process to remediate aquifers                      
              contaminated with chlorinated aliphatic compounds such as                      
              trichloroethylene (TCE).  Successful in situ treatment of saturated            
              zone soils and liquid requires the presence of metabolically                   
              capable bacteria in the polluted target zone.  In many cases,                  
              metabolically desirable microorganisms may not be present in the               
              contaminated zone, or may be unevenly distributed throughout the               
              subsurface.  TCE is a common ground water contaminant that is very             
              efficiently degraded by the aerobic methanotroph Methylosinus                  
              trichosporium OB3b.  However, M. trichosporium, like most soil                 
              isolates, has natural adhesive properties which cause them to bind             
              to soil surfaces, thus limiting their accessibility to the                     
              contaminant.  We are generating an adhesion deficient mutant of                
              OB3b capable of moving through an aquifer while actively degrading             
              TCE and related toxic substances. An organism with this capability             
              would serve as the basis for a cost-effective in situ treatment                
              technology, or provide synergistic benefits when combined with                 
              current pump-and-treat methods of purifying aquifers.
