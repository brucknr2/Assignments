Abstract    :
              Production of recombinant products of pharmaceutical and industrial            
              importance in a variety of microorganisms has yielded a wide                   
              variety of biologically active proteins.  Fungi offer the advantage            
              of reduced culturing and downstream processing cost because they               
              are capable of secreting prodigious quantities of protein.  The                
              genetics and biochemistry of Neurospora crassa are the most fully              
              characterized of the filamentious fungi.  The development of a high            
              activity, efficient secretion expression vector system for N.                  
              crassa will facilitate efficient production of heterologous                    
              proteins in this fungus.  This proposal aims to identify and clone             
              an abundantly secreted native protein of N. crassa and characterize            
              its promoter and secretion signal.  The new N. crassa expression               
              and secretion vectors capable of producing high levels of secreted             
              recombinant proteins.
