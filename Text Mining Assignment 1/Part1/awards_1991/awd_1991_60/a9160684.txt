Abstract    :
              The goal of this research is to determine the                                  
              effects of certain substrate surface                                           
              microgeometries on cell growth.  The eventual                                  
              application of this work will be in the                                        
              design of orthopedic implants with a range of                                  
              surface geometries which will facilitate the                                   
              desired cellular response on the various                                       
              regions of the device.  The design of three                                    
              types of surfaces will be investigated;                                        
              namely, 1) one that promotes bone growth and                                   
              inhibits soft tissue growth, 2) one that                                       
              allows soft tissue growth but not bone                                         
              growth, and 3) one that acts as a barrier to                                   
              fibrous tissue growth.  The cellular response                                  
              to sputter coated Ti surfaces which have                                       
              various dimensions of square wave                                              
              microgeometries will be compared to a flat                                     
              surface.  If the square wave shape does not                                    
              produce the desired cellular responses, a                                      
              cusp shaped microgeometry will be evaluated.                                   
              Two cellular lines will be tested - rat                                        
              tendon fibroblasts and rat bone marrow cells.                                  
                                                                                             
              Phase II of the research will concentrate on                                   
              the design and in vivo testing of orthopedic                                   
              implants with the appropriate microgeometries                                  
              strategically placed on the implant to obtain                                  
              the desired cellular responses.
