Abstract    :
                   The sizes and numbers of gas bubbles in water are                         
              reflected in the susceptibility to cavitation and in the                       
              acoustical properties.  Acoustic probing is a simple and robust                
              experimental method for obtaining information about the                        
              population of bubbles; however, the conversion of the measured                 
              data requires solution of a complex ill-posed inverse problem.                 
              This project will incorporate the multi-phase character of the                 
              bubbles into the model used for solving problems of this kind.                 
               Multi-phase flow and bubble dynamics will be modelled to obtain               
              proper equations for determination of the bubble population; and               
              the resulting ill-posed problems will be solved by                             
              regularization.  This solid theoretical framework can be used to               
              design instruments for accurate determination of the bubble                    
              population.
