Abstract    :
              Device performance of GaAs metal-                                              
              semiconductor field effect transistors                                         
              (MESFETs) on conventional semi-insulating                                      
              GaAs substrates has been limited by                                            
              backgate or sidegate effects which can                                         
              lead to undesirable cross-talk between                                         
              neighboring devices and thus impose                                            
              limits on packing densities.  Recent                                           
              research has shown that incorporation of                                       
              a low temperature buffer layer grown by                                        
              molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) can result                                        
              in many performance improvements,                                              
              including elimination of backgating.                                           
              Because of its very high processing cost,                                      
              MBE is not commercially viable production                                      
              method.  We propose to form an effect                                          
              buffer layer using ion implantation,                                           
              demonstrated manufacturable process.                                           
              One of the dominant characteristics of                                         
              the MBE-grown buffer layers is an excess                                       
              of As in the film.  Ion implantation is                                        
              well suited to simulate the MBE layers                                         
              since implantation conditions can be                                           
              tightly controlled to precisely engineer                                       
              the As profile by adjusting implantation                                       
              parameters such as dose, energy, and dose                                      
              rate.  Phase I work is to use ion                                              
              implantation to produce As-rich isolating                                      
              buffer layers in GaAs.  The structural                                         
              and electrical properties of the buffer                                        
              layers will be studied and compared to                                         
              those of MBE-grown layers.
