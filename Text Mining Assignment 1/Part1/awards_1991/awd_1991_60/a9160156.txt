Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A standard approach to analyzing periodic signal associated                    
              with the response of mechanical and electromechanical                          
              systems is the Fourier Transform.  However, there is no                        
              conventional method for detection and analysis of                              
              transients of such systems.  This project proposes the use                     
              of the wavelet transform as a solution to this problem.  It                    
              has recently been used for this purpose in non mechanical                      
              fields.  Phase I research will focus on fundamental issues                     
              related to repeatability of wavelet coefficients in the                        
              presence of arbitrary time shifts, and the ability to                          
              individually identify transients.
