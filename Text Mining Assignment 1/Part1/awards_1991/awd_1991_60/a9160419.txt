Abstract    :
                   Cadmium is electroplated in cyanide baths in 1,166 facilities             
              across the United States.  During the past two decades,                        
              considerable research has been conducted to reduce toxic chemical              
              discharge from cadmium electroplating operations.  However,                    
              economical elimination of cadmium discharge or sludge has not been             
              reported.  To address the environmental issues related to cadmium              
              electroplating, a novel plasma enhanced vapor deposition concept               
              was developed in the laboratory.  In addition to high deposition               
              rates for cadmium and zinc, the feasibility of in-situ cadmium                 
              reclamation to eliminate toxic chemical discharge was demonstrated.            
              It is also feasible to extend this concept to deposit or reclaim               
              zinc-cadmium alloys.  However, an understanding of the effect of               
              process variables on the deposition rate and properties of cadmium             
              is required.                                                                   
                   A systematic research using statistical experimental design               
              methods will develop this understanding.  The research could lead              
              to an environmentally acceptable cadmium vapor plating process (Dry            
              Plating) as an alternative to cyanide electroplating.
