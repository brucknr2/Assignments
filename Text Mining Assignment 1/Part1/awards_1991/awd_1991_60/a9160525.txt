Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Conjugated polymers are strongly absorbing and highly reflecting               
              throughout the infrared when doped to their conducting form.                   
              Conducting polymers are, therefore, ideal for use as infrared                  
              polarizers.  A novel method to fabricate mechanically robust                   
              composite polymer films, oriented by tensile drawing and                       
              containing a desired fraction of doped conjugated polymers, for                
              use as polarizers in the mid- and far infrared.  UNIAX will                    
              fabricate uniform, thin, aligned films by gel-processing                       
              conducting polymer composites to produce stable, doped films with              
              polarization rejection ratio suitable for spectroscopic work.                  
              During Phase I, the infrared-optical density and the infrared-                 
              dichroism of the oriented polyethylene/conducting polymer blends               
              will be independently controlled and characterized, and the                    
              stability of the resulting infrared polarizers will be tested.
