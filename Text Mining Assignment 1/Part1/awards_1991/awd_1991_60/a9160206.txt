Abstract    :
              This is a SBIR Phase I project.  It is proposed to develop a                   
              completely new process to produce Large Diameter Fiber Optic                   
              Tapers.  Fiber optic tapers are used in a wide range of                        
              applications including X-ray imaging system.  Virtually all the                
              existing tapers are less than 50 mm diameter.  However, many                   
              existing and potential applications require tapers up to 200mm.                
              Such tapers are difficult to make.  Incom has recently developed               
              technology which offer potential to overcome this difficulty.                  
              The objective of the research is to determine the feasibility of               
              this idea.  If successful, it will contribute to technical and                 
              commercial advancements in scientific imaging.
