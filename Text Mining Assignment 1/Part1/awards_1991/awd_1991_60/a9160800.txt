Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This project is to develop an instrument capable of                       
              measuring the concentration of torpospehric HO2 directly using                 
              tunable infrared diode lasers.  The proposed instrument would use              
              a novel multipass cell which maximizes the optical path-length                 
              while minimizing the cell volume and therefore also the HO2                    
              residence time and wall loss.  The Phase I effort will focus on                
              testing a prototype multipass cell and on choosing the best                    
              spectral region for monitoring HO2.  This evaluation will be                   
              based, in part, on HO2 pressure broadening coefficients which                  
              will be measured in Phase I.
