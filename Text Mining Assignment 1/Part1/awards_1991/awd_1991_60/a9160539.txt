Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research effort is designed to research and test teacher                  
              inservice materials and programs that will promote and support                 
              change and innovation in the teaching of mathematics in secondary              
              schools.  This Phase I project will focus on high school                       
              geometry, and address the new NCTM Standards with an agenda based              
              on a discovery approach to mathematics realized through                        
              cooperative student learning.  The proposal describes an                       
              inservice model which addresses the issues of applying new                     
              pedagogical directions to existing classroom, schoolwide, and                  
              district structures; assessing inservice results with metrics of               
              both student and teacher-participant performance; and                          
              establishing a mechanism by which the inservice's dissemination                
              can financially and motivationally self-perpetuation process.
