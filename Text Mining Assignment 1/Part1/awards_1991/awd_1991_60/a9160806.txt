Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Economical methods of removing and/or recovering dissolved                     
              organics or metals from water are necessary for US industrial                  
              competitiveness.  Also, firms specializing in hazardous waste                  
              disposal and pollution control will be a major area of                         
              industrial growth in the US.  Micellar-enhanced                                
              ultrafiltration (MEUF) is a new process which can remove                       
              dissolved organics and multivalent metal ions from waters.  In                 
              MEUF, an ionic surfactant, which forms aggregates called                       
              micelles, is added to water.  Organic and metallic species                     
              associate or bind with the micelles.  The solution is then                     
              treated in an ultrafiltration device with membrane pore sizes                  
              small enough to block the passage of micelles and the                          
              associated target solutes.  The result is an extremely pure                    
              permeate, and a very concentrated, low-volume retentate for                    
              disposal or much more economical ultimate recovery of the                      
              solutes.  Unlike most alternative methods, MEUF can                            
              simultaneously remove both organics and metals.  Reductions in                 
              concentration of two orders of magnitude in one pass have been                 
              demonstrated in preliminary work.  The percentage reduction                    
              does not decrease as the feed solute concentration decreases,                  
              making this technique particularly effective in the reduction                  
              of very toxic chemicals from low concentrations to ultralow                    
              concentrations.//
