Abstract    :
              The purpose of this work is to design x-ray optics                             
              for the collection and redistribution of the annular                           
              x-ray cone generated by transition radiation such                              
              that a uniform x-ray spot is delivered at high power                           
              density to a mask/wafer target.  This will increase                            
              the power density from the existing 1 mW/cm2 to 5                              
              mW/cm2 permitting transition radiation to be a                                 
              competitive source for x-ray lithography.  Transition                          
              radiation is emitted in conical annulus which has a                            
              central hole in the radiation pattern and more than                            
              half of the x-rays are emitted at angles larger than                           
              the angle of peak intensity.  Hence, efficient                                 
              collection of the x-rays and their proper collimation                          
              into a uniform beam area on the size of the mask                               
              and wafer target areas are required for uniform                                
              exposure of x-ray photoresist of microintegrated                               
              circuit production.  We will demonstrate feasibility                           
              of using Kumakhov x-ray optics to collect and                                  
              collimate x-rays from a transition radiation source                            
              over a angular range of up to + 30 mrad and to                                 
              provide a quasiparallel beam suitable of x-ray                                 
              lithography.  The desired intensity uniformity across                          
              the output x-ray beam is 3% .  A complete design                               
              of a Kumakohov lens based on computer simulation                               
              and on experimental results with single capillaries                            
              and polycapillaries and their correlation with                                 
              theoretical predictions will be done.
