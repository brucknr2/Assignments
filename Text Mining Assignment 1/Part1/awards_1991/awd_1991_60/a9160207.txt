Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              As an alternative to mercury-cadmium telluride (MCT), this                     
              program will investigate the optical properties of a recently                  
              invented class of type II strained-layer superlattices made of                 
              (GA,As) related compounds.  The new concept has advantages                     
              compared with previous efforts in that small band-gaps may be                  
              achieved with sufficiently thin repeating layers in the                        
              superlattices so that they have good optical absorption                        
              properties and favorable electrical transport properties original              
              calculations have indicated Ga1-xInxSb/InAs to be the best choice              
              for such application.  Very recently it has been shown to have                 
              the highest absorption coefficient at 10um wavelength compared to              
              all other superlattice materials.  To explore the potential of                 
              this material system, the investigators will fabricate the                     
              detector device structures by a multi-process molecular beam                   
              epitaxy technique in which the detector layers, passivation and                
              metallization are all done in-situ.
