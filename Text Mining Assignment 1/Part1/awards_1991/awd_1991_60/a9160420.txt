Abstract    :
              Field Flow Fractionation (FFF) has been demonstrated as a                      
              high speed analytical tool for separation and                                  
              characterization of macromolecules, biopolymers, and cell                      
              particles in the size range of 0.01 to 50 microns.                             
              Filtration is a widely accepted technique for simple                           
              purification and is commonly practiced in many analytical                      
              and biological research laboratories.  Coupling these two                      
              bio-compatible techniques in a two dimensional                                 
              multi-channel design will significantly increase the                           
              power, selectivity, separation speed, throughput, and                          
              analytical information related to the analytes.  Extension                     
              and commercialization of this technology for preparative                       
              scale application offers a new bio-compatible, rapid                           
              separation, characterization, and purification system for                      
              meeting the needs in bio-polymer, cell, and subcellular                        
              research.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              Two dimensional multi-channel design involves the use of                       
              membranes with decreasing pore size in a stacked assembly.                     
              Purified fractions would be collected at the outlet of                         
              each channel.  This project focuses on membrane and                            
              multi-channel detector technology, and the feasibility of                      
              commercialization of this multi-channel universal                              
              biopolymer purification system.
