Abstract    :
              A research program for a novel electron                                        
              cyclotron resonance (ECR) reactor for                                          
              dry etching and deposition is proposed.                                        
              The toroidal ECR reactor (TECR) uses a                                         
              unique magnetic geometry which offers                                          
              great potential benefits; (1) greatly                                          
              reduced exposure of the wafer to high-                                         
              energy photon radiation and associated                                         
              wafer heating, (2) uniformity of etching                                       
              over 8-inch wafers while maintaining                                           
              etching rates which are comparable to                                          
              conventional ECR sources (on the order                                         
              of 1 micron/minute. (3) the ability to                                         
              separate the ion composition from that                                         
              of the neutral composition striking the                                        
              wafer, and (4) very directional ion                                            
              fluxes that reduce pattern dependencies                                        
              in the etching of submicron features.                                          
              The design permits the separation of the                                       
              glow discharge from the wafer by using                                         
              magnetic field lines to guide the                                              
              transport of electrons and ions to the                                         
              wafer.  The etching uniformity across                                          
              the wafer can be adjusted by trimming                                          
              the solenoidal magnetic field, and thus,                                       
              can be controlled independently of the                                         
              process chemistry and discharge                                                
              kinetics.  In Phase I, the basic physics                                       
              of the reactor will be modelled, a                                             
              prototype reactor be designed and                                              
              engineering drawings produced.
