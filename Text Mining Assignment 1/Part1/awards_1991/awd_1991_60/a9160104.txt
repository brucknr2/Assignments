Abstract    :
                   This project will develop software to simulate flows and                  
              configurations to give insight into the dynamic mixing processes               
              involved in wakes, jets and shear layers.  In particular                       
              numerical code will be developed for flows of importance in                    
              aerodynamics.                                                                  
                   By basing the family of models for two-dimensional viscous,               
              incompressible flows on a Lagrangian formulation of fluid motion,              
              the dynamics of mixing can be studied as a function of the                     
              Reynolds number.  Viscosity is introduced by allowing the                      
              vorticity to diffuse as in the exact self-similar solution to the              
              Navier-Stokes equations describing the viscous growth of an                    
              isolated vortex core.
