Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This project implements a time-resolved photoluminescence                 
              technique and the related analysis method to study the carrier                 
              recombination decay process in heterojunction materials in a non-              
              destructive and contactless fashion.  The corresponding "surface               
              velocity" parameter describing the surface and/or interface quality            
              as well as the interface electric field will be determined                     
              quantitatively.  A quantitative description of the interface                   
              quality to determine the interface electric field and to establish             
              the relationship between these material properties and device                  
              performance is central to the characterization requirements of                 
              compound semiconductor heterojunction materials.
