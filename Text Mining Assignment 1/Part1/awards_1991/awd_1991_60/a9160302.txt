Abstract    :
              A low cost GPS Time sensor is proposed to be                                   
              developed which will be suitable for power system fault                        
              detection and control.  GPS provides a highly precise                          
              time reference which allows data to be synchronized to                         
              within 100 nanoseconds between substations and                                 
              control centers.                                                               
              Applications of precise time in power control include                          
              data logging, relay testing, fault isolation and phase                         
              angle measurements.  Failures can be isolated in a grid                        
              to a precision of 100 meters by measuring the relative                         
              time of arrival of a fault at two stations.  Phase angle                       
              measurements can be determined to a precision of 40                            
              micro-rad.  As part of this effort, a simulation will be                       
              performed on the network state estimation                                      
              performance improvement possible using these precise                           
              time measurements.                                                             
              Currently, the least expensive GPS timing receivers cost                       
              over $10,000.  Such equipment would be very expensive                          
              to install at tens of thousands of substations throughout                      
              the electric power grids.  It is proposed under this                           
              effort to develop a low cost precise time                                      
              synchronization GPS sensor for use in electric power                           
              system monitoring.  The proposed sensor will provide a                         
              highly reliable, time reference accurate to 100                                
              nanoseconds for a cost of less than $1,000.
