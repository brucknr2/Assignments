Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will introduce a new technique for low-frequency NMR              
              and NQR measurements in which a SQUID detector functions as a high-            
              sensitivity broadband detection system for stochastic NMR                      
              measurements.  The inherent sensitivity of a SQUID sensor, and its             
              wide bandwidth make it the ideal detection device for low-                     
              frequency, broadband resonance experiments.  The bandwidth of the              
              SQUID system also offers a unique match to the broadband nature of             
              the rf excitation used in stochastic NMR.  The combination of both             
              wideband and pulsed measurement capabilities in a single instrument            
              offers the promise of a unique and powerful new tool in NMR and NQR            
              studies of modern materials.
