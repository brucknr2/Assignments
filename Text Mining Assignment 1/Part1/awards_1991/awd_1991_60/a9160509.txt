Abstract    :
              A novel nonlinear crystal, beta-                                               
              barium borate (BB0), is proposed to                                            
              be used as a Pockels cell for                                                  
              excimer lasers operating at 248 nm                                             
              for the generation of high peak                                                
              intensities.  At present, a variety                                            
              of material related problems of                                                
              existing commercial Pockels cells                                              
              have limited their use below 300 nm.

              used in the experiments.  It has                                               
              good transmission down to 190 nm,                                              
              has a high damage threshold of 4                                               
              GW/cm2 and can handle average powers                                           
              up to 100 watts at 1064 nm.                                                    
                                                                                             
              A BBO Pockels cell will be designed
