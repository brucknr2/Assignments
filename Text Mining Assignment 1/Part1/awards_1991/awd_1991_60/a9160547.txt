Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Microcomputer-based Laboratories were developed to give students               
              a hands-on learning method and have been shown to improve student              
              performance.  Electronic advancements now allow for the research               
              of integrating existing, state-of-the-art, low cost, palm-sized,               
              portable data acquisition equipment into a portable                            
              Microcomputer-based Laboratory. The feasibility assessment will                
              be based on two experiments performed by sixth graders. This                   
              concept, if successful, could be applied to benefit science and                
              math education at all efforts.
