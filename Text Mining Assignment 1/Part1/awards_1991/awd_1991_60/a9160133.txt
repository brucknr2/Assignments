Abstract    :
                   Science Research Laboratory (SRL) is developing new,                      
              compact linear induction accelerator (LIA) technology which                    
              offers many advantages for bulk sterilization of medical                       
              products.  These accelerators are reliable and significantly                   
              less expensive than electrostatic or rf accelerators.  In                      
              addition, SRL induction accelerator are scalable to average                    
              electron beam powers of more than 800 kW at beam energies                      
              ranging from 5-10 MeV, providing an average of 100 kW of                       
              repetitively pulsed, high dose rate x-ray flux.                                
                   An experimental research program and concurrent design                    
              study will be carried out for Phase I.  An experiment to                       
              demonstrate efficient sterilization of medical product using                   
              high dose rate radiation from an existing LIA is planned.  In                  
              addition, a study will explore electron beam transport and x-                  
              ray target designs for production of a uniform x-ray radiation                 
              field for a definitive sterilization experiment to be                          
              performed in Phase II.
