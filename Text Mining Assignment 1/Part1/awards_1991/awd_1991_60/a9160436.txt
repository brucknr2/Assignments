Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Intense X-ray sources have been used in geophysical research              
              pods to determine strata formation density, lithology, and                     
              porosity.  The scattering of v-rays from 137 Cs or 60 Co sources with          
              decay activities of up to several Ci have been used extensively in             
              borehole logging.  A non-radioactive photon source is highly                   
              desirable since it reduces the radiological handling risk and the              
              risk of down hole loss.  North Star Research has conceived a novel             
              compact electrostatic accelerator that is capable of approaching               
              1 MV/cm in high voltage generator diameter thereby reducing the                
              size and mass of the system inserted into the well site.                       
              Preliminary experiments have demonstrated the utility of this                  
              electron accelerator in larger sizes.  This 'Nested High Voltage               
              Generator' will be useful for both low energy (<300 e V) v,v                   
              elemental composition and high energy (300 keV - 1MeV) v-ray                   
              Compton scattering measurements of density.  The nested high                   
              voltage generator approach is generates a continuous X-ray stream              
              which simplifies detector calibration when compared to pulsed                  
              accelerators.  This source will facilitate higher resolution                   
              measurements of the strata structure.
