Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Utilizing several concepts in pulsed CO2 laser technology, the            
              PIs propose the development of an 11 Joule per pulse, 50 pulse per             
              second CO2 laser amplifier suitable for Doppler lidar measurements             
              of remote wind fields at ranges up to 70 km.  A novel conduction               
              cooled laser head will be incorporated into the expanding beam                 
              laser architecture for optical extraction, and the laser will be               
              driven by the PIs patented all-solid-state pulse power technology.             
              This will allow a laser cost 2 to 3 times lower than presently                 
              available pulsed CO2 systems with comparable outputs.
