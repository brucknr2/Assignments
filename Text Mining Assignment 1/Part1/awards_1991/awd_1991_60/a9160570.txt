Abstract    :
              This is a SBIR Phase I project.  The goal of the project is to                 
              develop an improved method of protein sequencing based on the                  
              capillary high performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass               
              spectrometry.  Specifically, the project involves the development              
              of a probabilistic model for peptide fragmentation and ionization              
              that is consistent with actual data, and the development of a                  
              prototype algorithm that finds the peptide wit the maximum                     
              likelihood of yielding a given spectrum.  The commercial                       
              potential of this work is the development of a software system                 
              which would analyze peptide fragment mass spectroscopy data to                 
              yield protein sequence data.  If successful such a product could               
              be provided as a stand alone system or it could be integrated                  
              into the software packages that are provided with mass                         
              spectrometers.
