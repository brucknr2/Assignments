Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 project is              
              in the general area of instrumentation development in the subfield             
              of mass spectrometry.  The combination of gas chromatography with              
              mass spectrometry (GC/MS) provides the best general purpose                    
              analytical instrument for sensitive characterization of complex                
              mixtures.  It is used in fields of science and technology.  In                 
              most cases, the gas chromatograph separates the starting mixture               
              into its constituent compounds prior to analysis by the mass                   
              spectrometer.  The separation step is the most time-consuming                  
              part of the analysis, often taking an hour, while mass analysis                
              for each constituent is complete in a second or less.                          
                                                                                             
              This project provides a method for the direct mass spectroscopic               
              analysis of mixtures and can speed overall analysis time by                    
              reducing the degree of chromatographic separation.  The                        
              investigators use a novel ionization modulation scheme that                    
              increases the amount of chemically useful information obtained                 
              from a mass spectrometer.  The system is automated and supports                
              computerized deconvolution of the resultant two-dimensional                    
              spectra.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              The Phase I program addresses optimization of the instrument                   
              design by maximizing the data acquisition rate (while maintaining              
              good signal-to-noise ratios over a large dynamic range),                       
              determining the limits to sensitivity, determining the optimum                 
              electron energy resolution and selecting the best algorithm for                
              computerized data reduction.
