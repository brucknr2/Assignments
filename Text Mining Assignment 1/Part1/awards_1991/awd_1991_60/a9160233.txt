Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 project is              
              in the general area of Chemical Characterization in the subfield               
              of separation science.  Aqueous two-phase extraction (ATPE) is a               
              mild procedure for isolating cells, cellular organelles, and                   
              biologically produced macromolecules such as enzymes.  For small               
              scale separations, ATPE is most economical; however, due to the                
              cost of polymers used in the extraction systems (e.g., dextran)                
              costs become unfavorable for large scale separations.  In this                 
              project new polymers will be synthesized that will be economical,              
              extract proteins efficiently, and possess other physical                       
              properties favorable for large separations.
