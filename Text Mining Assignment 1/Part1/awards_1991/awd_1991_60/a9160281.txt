Abstract    :
                   Epitaxial gallium phosphide (GaP) will be studied as a                    
              promising new material for the manufacture of particle                         
              detectors.  Due to a high indirect bandgap and exceptional                     
              crystalline quality, epitaxial gallium phosphide detectors                     
              will provide superior performance in high-temperature, high-                   
              radiation environments.  Extremely low reverse saturation                      
              current and good signal-to-noise ratios are expected from                      
              gallium phosphide detectors.  This Phase I program will apply                  
              a systematic approach to demonstrate the capabilities of                       
              epitaxial GaP detectors.  A comprehensive study of intrinsic                   
              and compensated high resistivity epitaxial gallium phosphide                   
              layers and PN detectors will be performed.  A novel device                     
              design intended to extend the high energy collection                           
              efficiency of an epitaxial particle detector will be proven.                   
              The Phase II program will further develop and optimize this                    
              device as well as develop a technology to economically produce                 
              millimeter thick epitaxial layers of high resistivity detector                 
              grade gallium phosphide.
