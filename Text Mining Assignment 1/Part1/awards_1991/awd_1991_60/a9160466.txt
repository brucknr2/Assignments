Abstract    :
              This work is to make available a high resolution, full color                   
              autostereoscipic 3-D display.  With this design there is no need               
              for the glasses, shutters or polarizers which in the past have                 
              caused viewer discomfort and dimmed images.  The display is                    
              scalable in size, lightweight and environmentally stable.  The                 
              approach is based on a stationary multiplexed volume reflection                
              holographics screen and a simple conventional projection system.               
              Three-color images are received by each eye separately because of              
              the construction of the screen.  It will be efficient and                      
              compatible with current output devices.
