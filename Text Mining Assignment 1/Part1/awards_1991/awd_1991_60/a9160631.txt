Abstract    :
                   The large detectors at the Super Collider (SSC) will                      
              require scintillating and wavelength shifting plastic optical                  
              fibers.  Because of the 100 to 1000 higher intensity at the                    
              SSC, the ambient radiation levels are much greater than                        
              previously encountered at atom smashers.  Existing fibers                      
              based on polystyrene as the core plastic tend to degrade in                    
              the high radiation fields.  This research will demonstrate the                 
              feasibility of producing fibers based on polysiloxane which                    
              will be much more resistant to the damaging effects of                         
              radiation.                                                                     
                   This work is novel because there will be used an                          
              elastomer for the core of the fiber and a unique blend of                      
              copolymer for the cladding, neither of which have ever before                  
              been used in the production of radiation resistant optical                     
              fibers.  Based on the existing data these new fibers are                       
              expected to be stable in response up to about 10 Megarads.
