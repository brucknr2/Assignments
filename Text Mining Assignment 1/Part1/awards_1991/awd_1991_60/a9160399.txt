Abstract    :
              To build fast inexpensive artificial neural network hardware, a                
              high-performance but compact synapse circuit is required.  Digital             
              implementations require large synapse circuits.  Existing analog               
              synapse designs are highly non-linear or require expensive                     
              fabrication processes.  The proposal is to develop, simulate,                  
              layout, and fabricate a new linear synapse circuit during Phase I.             
              The new linear synapse circuit is small, allows for on-chip                    
              learning, and uses standard CMOS bulk technology and so resulting              
              neural network chips can be fabricated inexpensively by many                   
              vendors.  The circuit density improvement could be more than 100               
              over existing circuit design.
