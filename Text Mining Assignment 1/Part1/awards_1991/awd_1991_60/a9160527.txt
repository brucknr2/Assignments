Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A common dilemma in ecosystem modeling is the complexity of                    
              biological systems and the lack of sufficient data.  Traditional               
              modeling approaches require quantitative data and detailed                     
              knowledge of the ecological system.  Although such data may be                 
              available for small controlled systems such as the laboratory                  
              microcosm, in most cases sufficient information is not available               
              for large natural systems.  Qualitative modeling is a recent                   
              modeling approach developed to alleviate this problems.                        
              Qualitative models encapsulate more complex submodels by                       
              replacing continuous quantitative variables with descriptive                   
              state variables and equations with "if...then" transition rules.               
              This approach follows the recent development in hierarchical                   
              ecosystems theory and provides a compromise position between                   
              complex models and insufficient data.  The use of qualitative                  
              models in ecology has been limited up to now and the software                  
              tools for the researcher has been constrained to programs                      
              implemented for specific case studies.  In this study the                      
              investigators propose to develop a general qualitative modeling                
              program applicable to wide range of ecological problems.  The                  
              program will be based on an intuitive graphical interface                      
              conferring the benefits of easy access for users without                       
              specialized programming knowledge.
