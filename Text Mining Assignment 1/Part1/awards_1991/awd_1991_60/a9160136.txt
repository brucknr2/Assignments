Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Reactive beam assisted coating (IBAD) of carbides at low                       
              temperatures is difficult with conventional IBAD hardware because              
              no convenient ion source of carbon exists.  Carbides are very                  
              useful coating materials with superior hardness properties and in              
              the case of SiC, exceptional oxidation resistance.  Carbide                    
              coating would be more widely used commercially if more deposition              
              techniques other than high temperature chemical deposition or                  
              sputtering were available.  A method is proposed to produce an                 
              intense low energy ion beam of carbon that is particularly well                
              suited for reactive IBAD coating of carbides.  The general                     
              technique will be demonstrated using a Silicon carbide coating.
