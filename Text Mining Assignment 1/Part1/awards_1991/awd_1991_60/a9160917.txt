Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The research proposed is a program to administer and manage a                  
              program in modern biotechnology with the commercial result of                  
              demonstration modules for use in high school classes.  The effort              
              includes summer workshops for high school teachers, university                 
              faculty and industry experts.  In later sessions, students will                
              utilize demonstration modules tested and refined in classroom                  
              settings.
