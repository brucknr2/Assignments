Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The proposed program is aimed at developing aluminum gallium              
              nitride heterostructure devices for high temperature sensor and                
              electronics applications.  We will focus on the high electron                  
              mobility transistor (or HEMT) for use as a high temperature                    
              microwave device or as a sensitive ultraviolet detector.  Gallium              
              nitride has a large bandgap of 3.2 eV which gives it a greater                 
              breakdown voltage and a higher saturated electron velocity than                
              gallium arsenide.  In addition, it is stable in air to around                  
              800oC which makes it ideal for high temperature HEMT device use.               
                   HEMT devices are excellent for both power and low noise                   
              amplification since they posses a high carrier concentration and               
              enhanced carrier mobility.  Their power and noise performance                  
              increases with the potential barrier at the heterostructure                    
              interface.                                                                     
                   A Phase I program is proposed to produce high n-doped good                
              optical quality films using a unique atomic layer epitaxy                      
              approach.  All the present day growth and doping procedures                    
              cannot produce low resistivity epilayers.  A successful Phase I                
              program combined with our demonstration of high quality films and              
              enhanced electron mobilities in heterojunctions with aluminum                  
              concentrations less than 20% will form a strong basis for a Phase              
              II HEMT fabrication effort.
