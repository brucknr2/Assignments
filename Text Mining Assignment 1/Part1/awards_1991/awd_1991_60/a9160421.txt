Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Traditional cost analysis in manufacturing contains many                  
              assumptions that eventually lead to incorrect decisions.                       
              Cost accounting does not include adequate production models                    
              and assumes that costs are linear.  Cost allocation rules                      
              used in these models may distort the perceived part costs and                  
              lead to incorrect decisions.                                                   
                                                                                             
                   The proposers propose a new method of analysis:  a total                  
              system model.  It creates a complete model of both the                         
              production system and business expenses.  It uses queling                      
              theory to model the production system.  Details and benefits                   
              of this model are included.  The cost model contains the                       
              production related costs as well as all non-production                         
              resources and their expenses.  This data needs to be                           
              sufficient to create a financial statement for the                             
              manufacturing unit.  Analyzing each production scenario will                   
              involve building a system model of that scenario.  Decisions                   
              are made by comparing the system models of each possible                       
              scenario.  This method of analysis avoids the pitfalls of                      
              traditional cost analysis and can answer previously                            
              unaddressed questions in a simple and understandable manner.
