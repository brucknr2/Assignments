Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Fusion Systems has fabricated ultraviolet reflectors using                
              aluminum-based dielectric multilayers.  The resulting optical                  
              characteristics of the multilayer assembly display phenomena                   
              characteristic of anomalous, metallic-like optical properties,                 
              while retaining the basic dielectric character of the materials.               
              The descriptive term "transparent aluminum" has been applied to                
              this phenomena.                                                                
                   The phenomena was discovered during studies for development               
              of high reflectance (greater than 95%), broadband ultraviolet                  
              reflectors for use in the deep UV and mid UV portions of the                   
              electromagnetic spectrum.  This project investigates the optical               
              and electronic properties of this phenomena for potential                      
              application in the deep UV and vacuum UV (VUV), as well as other               
              regions of the electromagnetic spectrum.  Suitable analytical                  
              techniques attempt to further define the anomalous phenomena in                
              both theoretical and experimental terms.  A study of the                       
              possibility that "transparent aluminum" analogues may exist for                
              alternate, proprietary materials is also part of the project.
