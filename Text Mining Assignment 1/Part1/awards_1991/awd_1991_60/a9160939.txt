Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This is a proposal to develop secondary ion mass spectrometry             
              (SIMS) based imaging isotope ratio techniques for isotopic                     
              microanalysis of mineral deposits.  This capability will be                    
              combined with SIMS based trace element microanalysis.  The                     
              petrogenesis of ore deposits often involves an aqueous solution by             
              which the ore-bearing components are transported.  These                       
              hydrothermal solutions also transport sulfur.  Different aqueous               
              processes give rise to different 34S/32S isotope fractionations.               
              The 34S/32S ratios can provide important indications of the sulfur             
              origin, and by extension, the origin of economically important                 
              metals.  Isotope ratio and trace element imaging show the                      
              interrelationships of different mineral generations.  These                    
              generations often coexist within a single mineral grain.  The PIs              
              have demonstrated that imaging SIMS can successfully identify the              
              location of trace gold levels ("invisible" gold) in pyrite rims,               
              and that isotope ratio imaging of meteoritic materials highly                  
              enriched in deuterium is possible.  However, extension to 34S/32S              
              isotope ratio imaging requires further innovation and many careful             
              measurements.  In Phase II, these imaging techniques will be                   
              extended to microanalytical age dating and microanalytical trace               
              element petrogenesis.
