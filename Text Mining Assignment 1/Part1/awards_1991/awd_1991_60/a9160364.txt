Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The proposed effort will create a series of skill-building                     
              materials aimed at meeting the special needs of blind students                 
              studying mathematics.  These documents will be in braille, audio               
              tape, and ink print, aimed at blind students, their mainstream                 
              teachers, their resource teachers and their parents.  These                    
              materials will allow more blind students to develop their full                 
              potential in mathematics and science.  In addition, computer                   
              based tools will be developed for the quick generation of useful               
              tactile diagrams.
