Abstract    :
              The project described in this proposal involves the design and                 
              implementation of a speech driven computer interface which could               
              be used as a communication tool for the disabled.  The approach                
              outlined involves the use os parallel filter banks, followed by                
              various signal processing stages and a gamma network composed of               
              gamma memory sections and a back-propagation neural network.  The              
              system will be designed for use on a NeXT computer, which                      
              contains a microphone and a DSP chip, so that no additional                    
              hardware will be required.  The investigators will test the                    
              system on isolated words although one of the justifications for                
              the neural network approach is so that a continuous signal stream              
              could be processed without necessitating the segmentation of the               
              speech signal into allophones or words.  It is expected that this              
              approach will perform better than techniques that are presently                
              used on low cost computers.  Because this approach uses networks               
              designed to process time-varying signals in a speech recognition               
              system it could have an impact on the technology in this area if               
              it can be extended to process continuous speech.
