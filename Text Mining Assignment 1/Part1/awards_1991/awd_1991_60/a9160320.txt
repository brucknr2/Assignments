Abstract    :
                   This research is focussed on the application of Ion Beam                  
              Figuring (IBF) techniques to manufacture aspheric optical elements.            
              IBF will be used to remove spherical aberration and defocus.  This             
              will be accomplished in several steps. An optical map of the                   
              element will be first obtained using phase measurement                         
              interferometry.  This will be processed by a restoration algorithm,            
              which is to be developed, to determine the time the ion beam source            
              is to dwell at each location in front of the substrate.  IBF will              
              then be performed to make the aspheric element.                                
                   This approach will remove a significant amount of uncertainty             
              from the process of fabrication of aspheric optics which are now               
              almost totally dependant on operator skill.  Since these type of               
              optics are pervasive in optical instrumentation, this research will            
              make a significant impact on improving the productivity of the                 
              optic industry.
