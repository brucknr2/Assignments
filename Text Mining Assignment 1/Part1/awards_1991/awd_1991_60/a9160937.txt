Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The recent invention of conducting polymer Light Emitting Diodes               
              (LEDs) expends the possible applications for conducting polymers               
              into the area of active light sources, with possible significant               
              advantages over existing gallium arsenide LED technology.  In                  
              order to exploit this alternative, some remaining technical                    
              barriers must be addressed.  Among these are the need for                      
              materials with higher quantum efficiency, in order to boost                    
              device visibility in bright sunlight.  UNIAX proposes to                       
              synthesize copolymers whose structure mimics that of a partially               
              conjuugated (but thermally unstable) precursor to the conducting               
              polymer poly(p-phenylene vinylene).  The precursor has been shown              
              to have a quantum efficiency about 20 times that of the daughter               
              fully conjugated polymer.
