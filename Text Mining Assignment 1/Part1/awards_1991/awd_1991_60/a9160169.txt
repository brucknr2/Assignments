Abstract    :
              The objective of the research is to develop scheduling                         
              algorithms for electric generation that account directly                       
              for system security requirements.  Virtually all                               
              algorithms in use currently do not optimize generating                         
              unit commitment decisions against security                                     
              requirements from the outset and yield, therefore,                             
              suboptimal results when the commitment decisions                               
              must be adjusted to comply with these requirements.                            
              Utilities can obtain significantly better results if they                      
              use optimal scheduling algorithms that comply directly                         
              with security requirements.  While algorithms of this                          
              type had severe computational requirements, five-to-ten                        
              years ago, recent advances in network programming                              
              have now made these algorithms more attractive.                                
              The PI proposes to demonstrate the practical feasibility                       
              of a new algorithm for solving the security-constrained                        
              unit scheduling problem.  The innovation of our                                
              approach is to capture the system security requirements                        
              within a network flow subproblem that is solved in                             
              conjunction with the unit commitment problem.  In                              
              Phase One of this effort we will develop a prototype                           
              implementation of this method by integrating a                                 
              state-of-the-art network flow algorithm into an                                
              advanced unit commitment algorithm.  We will                                   
              demonstrate the cost savings possible with this                                
              algorithm on realistic test cases using representative                         
              utility data.
