Abstract    :
              Many applications today often                                                  
              require laser systems that can                                                 
              deliver an accurate amount of high                                             
              peak power in a very short time                                                
              interval.  Examples of these                                                   
              applications include range finding,                                            
              laser drilling and cutting, and                                                
              studies of optical properties of                                               
              materials.  One method of achieving                                            
              this is to Q-switch a diode-pumped                                             
              solid-state laser.                                                             
                                                                                             
              There are different ways to Q-                                                 
              switch a laser, the fundamental                                                
              approach being to suppress lasing                                              
              as the field builds within the                                                 
              laser cavity, then to dump all the                                             
              power in a single pulse.  Most Q-                                              
              switching methods are limited by                                               
              low repetition rates and high                                                  
              system cost.                                                                   
                                                                                             
              This program proposes to Q-switch a                                            
              short cavity Yb:YAG microchip laser                                            
              to develop a random time-encoded,                                              
              very short pulse laser operating at                                            
              1.029 nm which can be mass-produced                                            
              at low cost.
