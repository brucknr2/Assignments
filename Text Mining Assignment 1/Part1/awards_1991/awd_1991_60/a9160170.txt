Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Fluids that rapidly and reversibly change to solids on the                
              application of an electric field would be very useful for damping              
              vibrations.  Electro-rheological fluids exist; however, because                
              they are suspensions of solids in inert liquids, problems are                  
              experienced with designing practical devices.                                  
                   Electroviscous fluids are single-phase liquids whose                      
              rheology changes on application of an electric field.  This                    
              effect is normally very small.  This Phase I research explores                 
              the feasibility of designing electroviscous fluids that                        
              experience large changes in viscosity on application of electric               
              fields.  The research involves synthesis of the experimental                   
              verification of the unusual properties of a novel class of                     
              lubricants.
