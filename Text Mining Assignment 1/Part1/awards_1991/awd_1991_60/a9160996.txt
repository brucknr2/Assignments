Abstract    :
              A Phase I SBIR award will investigate the use of carbon-polysulfone            
              as the bone plate material for internal fracture fixation and                  
              includes analysis, design and fabrication.  A two stage                        
              manufacturing procedure was identified: (1) near net shape                     
              fabrication on a bone shaped mandril followed by (2) reshaping in              
              the operating room for a custom fit to the patient.
