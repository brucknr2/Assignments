Abstract    :
                   The research will develop a thin-film integrated capacitor                
              structure that incorporates an insulator with a very high                      
              dielectric constant.  This can have important application to high-             
              density computer memory chips with elements on the micron and                  
              submicron scale.  In its rutile crystalline form, titanium dioxide             
              exhibits a dielectric constant greater than 100, which corresponds             
              to a capacitance of 1 microfarad per square centimeter for a 100               
              nm dielectric layer.  This can be integrated together with TiN                 
              electrodes, so that the entire TiN/TiO2/TiN trilayer structure can             
              be prepared simply by reactive sputtering from a single Ti metallic            
              target in appropriate atmospheres.  Since TiN is also a well-known             
              diffusion barrier in silicon technology, it will prevent                       
              interaction with other materials during processing steps.  This                
              trilayer can then be patterned using ion etching to isolate the                
              various capacitors on the chip.                                                
                   The work will optimize the process for manufacturing these                
              capacitors on large-area Si wafers, demonstrate their reliability,             
              and to develop improved deposition equipment that incorporates                 
              these processes into integrated circuit manufacturing technology.
