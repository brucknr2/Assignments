Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A fully automatic, fiber-fed astronomical spectrograph will be                 
              designed, developed, and evaluated that will allow observations to             
              be made at unmanned (automatic) observatories in a highly                      
              economical and convenient manner.  In Phase I, the key questions               
              concerning automated astronomical spectroscopy will be addressed,              
              and alternative solutions will be considered.  A specific set of               
              solutions will then be selected and a preliminary design will be               
              completed.  In Phase II, detailed design of the prototype                      
              spectrograph will be completed, the prototype spectrograph will be             
              built, and its performance and utility will be evaluated on a fully            
              automatic telescope by typical astronomical researchers, educators,            
              and students.
