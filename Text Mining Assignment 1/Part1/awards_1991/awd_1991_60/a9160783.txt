Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The goal of this program is the development of a novel                         
              membrane-based two-phase flow system for the separation of                     
              enantiomers in a racemic mixture.  This system is based on the                 
              use of chiral fine particles, which selectively adsorb one of                  
              two enantiomers from an organic solution containing the                        
              racemic mixture.  Preliminary experimental results support the                 
              proposed approach.                                                             
                                                                                             
              The process promises to offer substantial advantages over                      
              competing enantiomer-separation processes, including kinetic                   
              resolution, diasteromeric derivatization, and chiral                           
              chromatography.  These advantages include: 1) high                             
              selectivity, 2) low cost, 3) suitability for use on a                          
              preoperative (e.g., 1- to 100-gram) scale, and 4) wide                         
              applicability for many chiral compounds.  In Phase I, the                      
              feasibility of the process for the separation of enantiomers                   
              of propranolol, an important cardiovascular drug, from a                       
              racemic mixture will be demonstrated.  In Phase II, the                        
              approach will be evaluated and characterized for the                           
              separation of a wide spectrum of pharmacologically relevant                    
              chiral compounds and the process will be optimized for a                       
              selected compound.  Based on the commercial promise of this                    
              concept, it is expected to proceed directly to                                 
              commercialization of the process in Phase III.
