Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is              
              in the general field chemistry characterization in the subfield                
              of mass spectrometry.  The objective of this project is to                     
              determine the feasibility of the matrix-assisted laser desorption              
              (MALD) technique on a triple electrostatic sector time-of-flight               
              mass spectrometer (TOF-MS) for the analysis of bio-organic                     
              compounds.  This particular TOF-MS was developed at CHARLES EVANS              
              AND ASSOCIATES and features high mass resolution (theoretical                  
              limit of c.a. 10,000 (FWHM), excellent mass accuracy (ppm range)               
              and special stigmatic ion optics which permit direct ion imaging               
              over a large (200 micrometer) field of view.  A Nd:YAG laser will              
              be added to this instrument to study this instrument's                         
              suitability to high molecular weight biopolymer analysis.                      
              Currently available MALD-TOF systems have shown promising and                  
              useful data in this application but suffer from poor mass                      
              resolution.  The ability to generate data at higher mass                       
              resolution will provide significant advances in the biomolecular               
              sciences.  High mass resolution MALD-TOF spectrometry could                    
              distinguish different adducts or modifications of a molecular                  
              species as well as explore the heterogeneity which is common in                
              biopolymers.  Should implementation of this technique prove                    
              feasible, widespread applications in the fields of protein and                 
              peptide chemistry and structural biology in general are                        
              anticipated.
