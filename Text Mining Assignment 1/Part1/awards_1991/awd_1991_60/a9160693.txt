Abstract    :
              The research will develop a new analytical tool and                            
              technique permitting in-situ analysis of dissolved metals                      
              in ground water.  The project consists of realizing the                        
              analysis of dissolved metals by applying the well known                        
              principles of polarography in a novel manner.  The details                     
              of this new analytical technology are presented and                            
              described in the proprietary section.  ?PS-1!.  The program                    
              will perform better than standard available electrochemical                    
              techniques for the in-situ analysis of dissolved metals for                    
              the following reasons: (1) problems associated with                            
              electrode poisoning are prevented by first exhausting the                      
              electrodes poisons from the water to be analyzed; (2) most                     
              between species interactions and interferences at the                          
              surface of the working electrodes are suppressed; (3) many                     
              of the constraints encountered using classical                                 
              polarographic techniques are suppressed; (4) low detection                     
              levels are achieved; (5) better separation of                                  
              electroplatable species.                                                       
                                                                                             
              The small size will permit deployment of the devices                           
              directly as in-situ sensors supported by most available                        
              commercial probes capable of housing a device a few                            
              centimeters in size.  The use of microfabrication for the                      
              production of the sensors will provide new sophisticated                       
              analytical devices at low cost per unit.
