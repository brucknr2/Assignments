Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Characterization of modern materials requires analytical probes                
              with superior detection limits and spatial resolution on a                     
              submicron scale.  In this project we develop a neutron focusing                
              device which can significantly enhance analytical techniques used              
              for the nondestructive investigation of surfaces, interfaces and               
              volumes on such a scale.  Existing analytical techniques which will            
              benefit from this development are neutron depth profiling, prompt              
              gamma activation analysis and neutron tomography.  The research                
              will subsequently lead to the practical application of neutron                 
              microscopy and three dimensional conformational.  Since low energy             
              neutrons have optical properties analogous to light, we will adapt             
              capillary optics which have already shown potential for focusing X-            
              rays.  We will calculate the transmission efficiency of neutrons               
              through such capillaries, measure the probability of transmission              
              of cold neutrons, and demonstrate the feasibility of foucusing                 
              neutrons using such a device.  Analysis of these results will                  
              enable the design of a prototype lens suitable for spatially                   
              distributed neutron sources provided by cold neutrons available                
              from a research reactor.  The device will then be made available               
              commercially for implementing in analytical instruments.
