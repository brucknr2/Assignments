Abstract    :
              This project will investigate the possible use of a three-                     
              dimensional quantitative imaging process, by measuring the                     
              microwave scattering field and utilizing a scattering inversion                
              algorithm.  The research is expected to produce a low-cost and                 
              transportable piece of equipment to be used to determine the                   
              moisture content in concrete, roofing materials and to monitor                 
              material defects.
