Abstract    :
                   With the new generation of programmable digital signal                    
              processing hardware and the recent development in computer-aided               
              design methods, a new approach to the design of signal processing              
              instruments, intelligent sensors, and instrumentation systems is               
              now possible.  The work will design and build a complete instrument            
              development system for the fast turn-around design of portable and             
              field instruments.  The system will consist of two components, a               
              line of generic programmable hand-held instrumentation hardware and            
              a computer-aided instrument design (CAID) package that will be used            
              to develop the application software.                                           
                   Most existing electronic instruments are targeted to a narrow             
              range of specific applications.  The main reason for this trend is             
              the great diversity of instrumentation problems and the lack of                
              powerful programmable hardware that can meet demands of a                      
              sufficiently wide variety of applications.  Two end products of                
              this technology will be:  multifunctional, cartridge-programmable              
              instruments targeted for a broad range of common instrumentation               
              problems; and the application-specific, field-programmable                     
              instruments developed by the end users.
