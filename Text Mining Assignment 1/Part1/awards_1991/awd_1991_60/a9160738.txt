Abstract    :
              This is a SBIR Phase I project.  The goal of this research is to               
              explore the use of object-oriented database management systems                 
              (ODBMS) for storing biological information and to demonstrate the              
              potential benefits of ODBMS over existing biological databases                 
              using the relational model.  A prototype implementation in a                   
              commercial ODBMS will be built to test performance using sample                
              data from existing databases, such as GDB, GenBank and GenInfo.                
              The software developed for the Phase I is expected to serve as an              
              executable prototype specification for SBIR Phase II development.
