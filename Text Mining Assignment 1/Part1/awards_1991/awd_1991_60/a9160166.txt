Abstract    :
                   This research will evaluate a new soft X-ray optic (a                     
              Soft X-ray Diffraction Plate, SXDP) which is analogous to a                    
              diffuser in the visible.  Because it can eliminate condenser                   
              optics and increase photon flux, it will be a useful optic                     
              wherever optical constants make refractive and reflective                      
              optical elements difficult.  The first application, in Phase                   
              II, will be to improve imaging soft X-ray microscopy (ISXM),                   
              making such microscopes more robust and commercially viable                    
              instruments.  We anticipate further applications will develop                  
              in areas where uniformity of illumination and preservation of                  
              flux are crucial.  X-ray spectroscopy of inhomogeneous sources                 
              and projection soft X-ray lithography will be among the first                  
              to benefit.                                                                    
                   The SXDP consists of an opaque film with a multitude of                   
              small holes, whose size is comparable to the wavelength of the                 
              X-rays.  This novel X-ray optic may improve flux through ISXMs                 
              by an order of magnitude and provide good numerical aperture                   
              matching.  This optic will contribute to the commercial                        
              development of a compact ISXM.                                                 
                   In Phase I, SXDP models, using analytical and computer                    
              techniques, will decide which manufacturing method will                        
              produce optimum SXDPs and evaluate their performance by                        
              comparing data with theory.
