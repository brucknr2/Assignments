Abstract    :
              The objective of this proposed research is to develop a CAD-Based              
              expert system for the design of structural repairs and for the                 
              detailed design of structural members.  The system will couple                 
              variational geometry, automated finite element mesh generation and             
              design sensitivity analysis into a tool capable of providing                   
              feedback on the effects of "what if" changes and of also                       
              determining, via a gradient descent search strategy, the optimum               
              shape for the repair concept under consideration.
