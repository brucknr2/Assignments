Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 project is              
              in the general area of chemical synthesis in the subfield of                   
              ferroelectricity.  The long range scientific goals of this                     
              research are to increase understanding of the correlation of                   
              molecular structure with physical properties of tilted liquid                  
              crystal phases, and to test strategies for design of new                       
              materials.  Specifically, the work is aimed at inventing new low               
              viscosity and low birefringence smectic C Hosts for use with high              
              polarization ferroelectric liquid crystal (FLC) dopants.  Such low             
              viscosity smectic C hosts, in combination with the proper chiral               
              FLC dopants, would have application in flat panel displays and                 
              spatial light modulators (SLMs) requiring the fastest rise times.              
              Ferroelectric (chiral) smectic C* liquid crystals have been shown              
              to exhibit high speed, multistate electro-optic and display device             
              applications, particularly when incorporated into the surface                  
              stabilized ferroelectric liquid crystal (SSFLC) light valve.  Flat             
              panel displays based upon the SSFLC device concept have many                   
              potential advantages.  However, due to the high birefringence and              
              relatively slow speed of existing materials, SSFLC light valves                
              prove problematical in some important applications.  Both of these             
              problems--high birefringence and slow switching speed--are                     
              addressed by the creation of a new class of perfluorinated FLC                 
              hosts.
