Abstract    :
              This proposal aims to:                                                         
              (1) conduct an international patent analysis for two product                   
              technologies that are believed to be in the growth stage of the                
              life cycle,                                                                    
              (2) identify non-patent technology indicators that can be                      
              collected for analysis at the level of a specific technology and               
              collect them for the two technologies,                                         
              (3) look for correlations between the patent and non-patent                    
              indicators,                                                                    
              (4) determine the life cycle stage of the technologies using                   
              patent indicators and forecast future technological activity,                  
              5) look for correlations between the number of subsequent patent               
              citations and other indicators of importance or value, and                     
              determine whether the importance of an invention can be predicted              
              early in its life,                                                             
              (6) review and assess models of technological innovation and                   
              technological evolution for whether they can be supported with                 
              patent data.                                                                   
              The proposal's commercial objective is to develop decisionmaking               
              tools based on this research.
