Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A new type of x-ray detector that utilizes a field effect                      
              transistor structure will be investigated in this project.  This               
              new detector offers the advantage of internal gain, low noise and              
              simple readout electronics.  Initial studies show that this                    
              detector type would have improved energy resolution over x-ray                 
              spectrometers currently in use.  The field effect transistor                   
              detectors would be very useful in applications in materials science            
              research and materials analysis or wherever a high performance                 
              solid state detector is required for x-ray spectrometer                        
              applications.  Owing to their small size and ease of readout these             
              devices would also be excellent for use in imaging x-ray detectors.
