Abstract    :
                   The goal of the research is to develop a precise mathematical             
              model (based on a piecewise-deterministic Markov process) for the              
              uncertainties in capacity expansion planning and to study the                  
              construction of optimal plans with this framework by means of                  
              stochastic control theory.  To provide a concrete context for the              
              Phase I work, the research plan is directed toward the specific                
              capacity expansion plans faced by electric utilities.  The                     
              investigator plans to achieve the research goal by: (a) formulating            
              a representative class of capacity expansion problems using demand             
              and completion time data from electric utilities; (b) determining              
              optimal controls or investment strategies for these problems using             
              analytic and numerical techniques; and, (c) implementing these                 
              optimization techniques on a computer and generating a set of                  
              clear, illustrative examples of their effectiveness.                           
                   Successful completion of these objectives will demonstrate the            
              feasibility of extending the approach to a prototype capacity                  
              expansion decision aid.  An optimization technique for generation              
              expansion planning would have direct application to determining                
              reserve margins, adopting new technologies, selecting units sizes,             
              and ensuring reliability.  In addition, such a technique would                 
              provide important leverage for addressing complex capacity                     
              expansion problems in other industries.
