Abstract    :
              The presence of excessive standing phase angle                                 
              difference across open circuit breakers which connect                          
              transmission stations cause significant delays in power                        
              system restoration.  During the initial phases of                              
              restoration when the power system is primarily under                           
              manual control, these phase angle differences are                              
              reduced by the time consuming process of trial and                             
              error adjustments of real power generation.                                    
              Determination of timely adjustments of the correct                             
              amount of real power generation at the right power                             
              plants are difficult tasks for the power system operator                       
              to perform, particularly under pressure of time.                               
              The prime objective of the proposed research is to                             
              develop an algorithm which would minimize the                                  
              amount and the number of adjustments in real power                             
              generation to reduce the excessive standing phase angle                        
              differences and allow closures of circuit breakers for a                       
              quick and orderly restoration of power systems                                 
              following a major disturbance.  The methodology has                            
              additional values during emergency operation, such as                          
              the unloading of large transformers overheated by                              
              Geomagnetically Induced Currents, or the reduction of                          
              power flows in the overloaded transmission lines.
