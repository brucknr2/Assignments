Abstract    :
              The problem of marine biofouling is very                                       
              important, and one to which extensive efforts                                  
              have been expended in order to find materials                                  
              that will prevent such fouling.  The                                           
              diversity and adaptability of marine                                           
              organisms is simultaneously impressive and                                     
              depressing.  It is sobering to consider the                                    
              facts that marine organisms will attach to                                     
              and colonize fluorinated polymer surfaces,                                     
              such as Teflon, albeit not as tenaciously as                                   
              to other materials, and that the pholad                                        
              Martesia has been observed to attack as inert                                  
              a polymer as polyethylene.                                                     
                                                                                             
              This research program involves a waterborne                                    
              polymeric formulation which promises to                                        
              significantly advance the state of the art of                                  
              non-toxic antifouling paints.  The novel                                       
              composition contains no toxic ingredients or                                   
              volatile organic compounds (VOC).  The                                         
              proposed technology is also attractive since                                   
              it involves only environmentally benign                                        
              components, will be easy to apply, and will                                    
              be of low cost.
