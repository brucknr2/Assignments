Abstract    :
              Bio-Eng is developing a continuous flow reversed                               
              micellar-organic phase (RM-ORG) process for the initial                        
              fractionation or purification of recombinant-DNA                               
              therapeutic protein intermediates which are harvested from                     
                                                                                             
              a fermentation broth.  The proposed RM-ORG process will                        
              not compete with, but will rather complement high                              
              resolution chromatographic purification steps.  RM-ORG                         
              fractionation would increase throughput capacity by                            
              reducing the loading on higher resolution chromatographic                      
              purification steps, and would thus reduce production time                      
              and costs.  Modest to high improvements in specificity (2                      
              to 10 fold) and high yields (95 to 100%) are anticipated.                      
                                                                                             
              Other intrinsic benefits to the RM-ORG process such as                         
              process stream clarification, concentration and buffer                         
              exchange are also anticipated.  Potential advantages of                        
              RM-ORG over existing primary purification processes                            
              include selectivity, speed of processing, preservation of                      
              protein integrity, and scalability.
