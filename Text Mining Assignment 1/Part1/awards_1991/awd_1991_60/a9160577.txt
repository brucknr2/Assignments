Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposed research would determine the feasibility of an                   
              educational software package, for use by undergraduate and                     
              graduate level engineering students, which would demonstrate and               
              aid in teaching physical and computational fluid dynamics.  The                
              software will be used as an adjunct to classroom lectures and                  
              would support three levels of usage:  introductory fluid dynamics              
              simulations, the underlying computational methodology, and user-               
              defined flow situations.  The initial version of the software                  
              will be introduced to university students. It is proposed that a               
              commercially viable education tool will be developed and marketed              
              to the university community.
