Abstract    :
                   An exploration of a new laser induced liquid phase deposition             
              process will be performed.  For microelectronics repairing and                 
              pattern direct writing applications of electronic circuits.  The               
              work will focus on a new electromechanical device to accurately                
              localize the disposing chemical and on new metal-organic                       
              precursors.  Several new chemical strategies and a series of new               
              Gold (1) compounds will be investigated to improve the electrical              
              and mechanical properties of deposited metal films.  The                       
              development of a piezoelectric ceramic ejector will substantially              
              benefit the deposition performance with controllable application               
              quantity and location of precursor solution.                                   
                   The goal of the program is to investigate the                             
              characteristics of the laser induced deposition process using                  
              liquid droplets generated by a piezoelectronic ejector.  Laser-                
              induced deposition process will be investigated using several,                 
              soluble precursor molecules and the deposited layers will be                   
              characterized.
