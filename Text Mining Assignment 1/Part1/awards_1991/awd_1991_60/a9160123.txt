Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) of high                         
              temperature superconducting materials has been shown to be                     
              feasible, and films deposited to date on flat substrates have                  
              electrical properties comparable to the best reported results.                 
              However, to take advantage of MOCVD to coat odd shapes, such as                
              the inside of rf cavities, requires innovative techniques.  This               
              is a proposal to test the feasibility of one such technique,                   
              using MOCVD for production of a seed crystal layer deposited                   
              slowly, one atomic layer at a time, on a non-planar substrate.                 
              The bulk of the film can then be deposited at high rates, which                
              should produce high quality yttrium-barium-copper-oxide films                  
              with excellent crystal orientation and surface quality.  As a                  
              test article of practical importance, we propose to coat the                   
              inside of a hollow cylindrical rf cavity.  Radio frequency                     
              characterization of the film deposited on a flat surface will be               
              performed in Phase I.
