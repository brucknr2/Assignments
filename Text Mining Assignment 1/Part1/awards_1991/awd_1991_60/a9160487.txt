Abstract    :
                   This project will develop and test a chlorophyll florescence              
              sensor for ecological studies.  The investigators will measure                 
              chlorophyll florescence in the oxygen A band, where atmospheric                
              oxygen spectrally excludes incident sunlight.  A cell containing               
              low pressure oxygen will be used as a narrow band filter to                    
              absorb chlorophyll florescence photons at the A band line                      
              centers, and later re-emit them for detection.  This non-invasive              
              technology has potentially wide commercial use in agriculture and              
              surveys of stressed vegetation.
