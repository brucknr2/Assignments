Abstract    :
              Diamond films are contemplated for                                             
              use in optical systems due to their                                            
              inert nature and hence their                                                   
              ability to protect the vital                                                   
              optical systems from the harsh                                                 
              environments.  Polycrystalline                                                 
              diamond films produce scattering                                               
              centers due to the different                                                   
              impurities, grain sizes and                                                    
              orientations that are produced by                                              
              the different deposition                                                       
              techniques.  A novel polishing                                                 
              method is proposed for providing                                               
              smooth surfaces.  This techniques                                              
              has the capability to be adapted                                               
              for contoured surfaces and can also                                            
              be used in combination with                                                    
              intelligent manufacturing systems.                                             
              Phase I effort will establish the                                              
              feasibility; however the follow on                                             
              effort will coat large complex                                                 
              geometries that can be                                                         
              characterized and field tested in                                              
              several optical applications.
