Abstract    :
              Solar cells have unique advantages as an alternative source of                 
              electric power.  This program will demonstrate high specific power,            
              lightweight, flexible, thin silicon solar cells.  These solar cells            
              can be directly substituted for existing state of the art silicon              
              solar cells with the effect of significantly improving specific                
              power, power/area, and power supply life.  The proposal describes              
              a lightweight, flexible, high-performance, ultra-thin silicon solar            
              cell that incorporates light-trapping and a graphite cloth                     
              substrate as an integral part of the device.  This new type of                 
              silicon solar cell will be developed for polar operations.  The                
              silicon layers will be deposited by electro-deposition.  These thin            
              films will demonstrate the lightweight and flexibility of other                
              thin film solar cell designs while maintaining the high performance            
              of crystalline silicon.
