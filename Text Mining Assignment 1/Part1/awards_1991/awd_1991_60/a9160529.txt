Abstract    :
               The objectives of this project are the refinement of cognitive                
              models of design and the development of a superquadrics and NURBS              
              based solid/surface modeling engine that would serve as the basis              
              for the Manufacturing Engineering Conceptual Design Environment                
              (MECDE).                                                                       
                   The research will provide the capabilities to support (1)                 
              designing products rapidly and conceptually, (2) assessing                     
              producibility, assemblibility, and other life-cycle                            
              characteristics, and (3) providing necessary information for                   
              supporting manufacturing activities such as process planning, tool             
              path/NC code generation, and assembly task planning.
