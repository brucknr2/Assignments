Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A large uncertainty exists concerning the quantitative ability of              
              the oceans to take up anthropogenic CO2.  A more complete                      
              understanding of the relationship between ocean and atmospheric                
              chemistries would broaden the ability of science to predict the                
              magnitude and rate of global warming so that appropriate                       
              countermeasures could be developed and implemented.                            
                                                                                             
              An analytical instrument is needed to make continuous measurements             
              of the CO2 concentration above and below the oceanic surfaces.  For            
              the large scale studies needed, the instrument will have to                    
              function unattended, allowing placement on surface buoys or ships,             
              and be able to transmit data to a central data collection station.             
              It will be developed to withstand the extreme environmental                    
              conditions routinely encountered at sea and utilize a new solid                
              state sensor technology that has the potential performance and cost            
              features suitable for remote monitoring of the CO2 levels in both              
              shallow and deep ocean waters.  The proposed system will include               
              the data acquisition and telemetry electronics for automated                   
              monitoring at remote locations.
