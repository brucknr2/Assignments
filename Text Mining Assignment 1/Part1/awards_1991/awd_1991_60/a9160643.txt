Abstract    :
              We propose to carry out research                                               
              leading to the development of a                                                
              stabilized laser diode which can be                                            
              locked to the frequency of any                                                 
              atomic or molecular absorption line                                            
              lying within the tuning range of                                               
              the diode.  Water vapor is a                                                   
              particularly convenient source of                                              
              an abundant number of absorption                                               
              lines in the spectral region of                                                
              interest.  The unique feature of                                               
              the proposed stabilization                                                     
              technique is the use of                                                        
              interferometric phase detection of                                             
              the zero-crossing point of the                                                 
              anomalous dispersion curve at the                                              
              position of line center.  Phase                                                
              detection has the advantage of                                                 
              being insensitive to intensity

              imbalances between the interfering                                             
              beams.  OPTRA proposes to use a                                                
              powerful phase measurement

              motivation in this program is the
