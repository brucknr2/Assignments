Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The proposal aims to determine the feasibility of a                       
              sophisticated system for retrieving statistical data about risk                
              and prognosis, as a means of aiding decisions for physicians                   
              whose practice include breast-cancer patients.  The proposed                   
              research will use survey methodology---including surveys of                    
              physicians and medical schools---to determine practicing                       
              physician's statistical environment, including their training,                 
              their perceived need for and attitudes about statistical data,                 
              and their use of computers and computerized databases.  A set of               
              statistical training modules will also be used to assess                       
              physicians' statistical experience.  The data analysis will                    
              characterize the responding population and will identify                       
              potential barriers to physicians' use of computerized data                     
              retrieval and decision systems.  These data will be used to                    
              develop guidelines for the user interface of such systems, with                
              particular emphasis on compensating for the identified barriers.               
              An on-line 'help' system, providing reviews of basic concepts and              
              targeting likely errors of interpretation (for which the                       
              statistical modules will be a prototype) is viewed as a                        
              potentially important component of the interface.
