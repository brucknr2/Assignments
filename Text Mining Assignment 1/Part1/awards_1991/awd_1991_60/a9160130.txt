Abstract    :
                   Often experimental conditions, the circumstances of an                    
              observational study or scientific theory or conjecture require an              
              ordered response.  Standard statistical analysis software does                 
              not allow constraints of these kinds, although the statistical                 
              theory is now well-developed.  This project will develop software              
              for order restricted inference.                                                
                   This project will integrate regression analysis and the                   
              analysis of linear models with order restricted inference.
