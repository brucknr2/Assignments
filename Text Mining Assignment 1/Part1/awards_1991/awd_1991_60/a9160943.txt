Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The electronics industry has become a major economic force.  By                
              1991, six percent ($758 million) of the total semiconductor market             
              will be accounted for by Gallium arsenide (GaAs) components.  GaAs             
              wafers will also account for a steady 6 percent share of total                 
              merchant wafer consumption through 1991.  GaAas IC's have now been             
              accepted for mainframe computers, work stations, digital and                   
              microwave communication systems, and test equipment designs.  GaAs             
              materials quality, yield and availability have improved.  Failed               
              GaAs materials, however, whether from undoped, unencapsulated                  
              wafers, doped wafers or fully mounted chips, can account for 73%               
              to 100% of starting materials.  The total dollar loss of GaAs, gold            
              and silver runs into millions of dollars per year.  Several                    
              comparies have begun chemical degradation and recovery of gallium              
              but the process is expensive and often enviromentally unsafe.                  
              Technical Research Associates, Inc. (TRA) has performed preliminary            
              experiments to determine the feasibility of biodegrading and                   
              recoving gallium, silver and gold from chips, wwafers and sludge.              
              The organism used in these experiments is TRA patent-pending and               
              listed with ATCC.
