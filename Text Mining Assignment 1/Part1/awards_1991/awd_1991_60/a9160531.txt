Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will develop an electron cyclotron resonance (ECR)                
              sputter source for metal oxide thin film deposition employing solid            
              metal oxide targets as a material source.  In Phase I, yttrium-                
              barium-copper-oxide will be used as the specific metal oxide in                
              order to evaluate and eliminate the effects of film damage by                  
              energetic particle bombardment ordinarily seen in conventional on-             
              axis sputtering experiments.  Recent work by another group suggests            
              a way to develop a large area high rate ECR metal oxide deposition             
              source which can overcome previous difficulties with on-axis                   
              sputter magnetrons.  Experiments will be carried out on a suitably             
              modified ECR test stand which will enable us to characterize both              
              the plasma formation through microwave ECR plasma production and               
              the RF sputtering of metal oxide targets.  The technology would be             
              compatible with currently available semiconductor tools.
