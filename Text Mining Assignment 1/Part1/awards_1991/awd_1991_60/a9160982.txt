Abstract    :
              This proposal relates to initial into the development                          
              of a novel new lithographic process which is capable                           
              of generating submicrometer microlithographic                                  
              images.  The proposal relates to a process of                                  
              impregnating a non-radiation sensitive polymeric                               
              resist coating with a non-reactive, gaseous                                    
              photoactive material, imaging said composition                                 
              using a variety of exposure sources, removing the                              
              unreacted photoactive material, leaving of latent                              
              image is then developed, preferably using oxygen                               
              reactive ion etching.  The major benefit is that this                          
              process does not require a radiation sensitive resist,                         
              nor does it use multiple coatings; and it involves                             
              little or virtually no additional processing compared                          
              to standard photoresist processing.  It is capable of                          
              providing submicron image dimensions in a top                                  
              layer imaging process.  The tone of the process can                            
              be either positive or negative, depending on the                               
              sequence of processing steps. This process is useful                           
              for imaging with ultraviolet, deep-UV, X-ray,                                  
              electron-beam, and ion-beam radiation.  It is                                  
              potentially useful for the formation of resist images                          
              on semiconductor and electro-optical substrates, as                            
              well as printed circuit board, innerlayer, optical                             
              disc, and litho plate preparation.
