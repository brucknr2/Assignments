Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The synthesis of diamond at low pressure by the plasma assisted                
              vapor deposition process has opened up the prospect for the                    
              realization of diamond based electronic devices with superior                  
              performance and high temperature and radiation tolerance                       
              capabilities.  Such applications require the diamond film to be                
              in single crystal form.  The realization of epitaxial grown                    
              single crystal diamond in any significant size, however, remains               
              as an illusive goal mainly due to present lack of understanding                
              and ability to control the nucleation process.  An alternate                   
              strategy for low pressure homo-epitaxial growth of single crystal              
              diamond films which preserves the substrate by employing cyclic                
              growth, lift-off and regrowth is proposed.  The strategy is based              
              on sub-level amorphization by ion-implantation techniques that                 
              have been demonstrated in other contexts.  The Phase I effort is               
              to determine if these techniques can be combined sequentially and              
              remain effective, leading to the realization of an effective                   
              technique for the preparation of single crystal diamond films.
