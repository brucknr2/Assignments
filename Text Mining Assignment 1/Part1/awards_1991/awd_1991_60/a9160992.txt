Abstract    :
              Extractive methods, in which a sealed sample of air is analyzed                
              in a laboratory, are expensive and are inapplicable to                         
              continuous, in situ monitoring of concentrations.  The PIs                     
              propose the development of an instrument called a laser                        
              interferometric absorptometer (LIA) to fill this need.  The basis              
              of this instrument is the interferometric measurement of the                   
              optical-path change that occurs immediately after a pulsed laser               
              beam is absorbed by trace species present in one arm of the                    
              interferometer.  The LIA will be sensitive to parts-per-trillion               
              trace-gas concentrations, 203 orders of magnitude better than                  
              instruments based on other approaches to monitor trace species in              
              the field.
