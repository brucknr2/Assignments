Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Numerous optical systems for optical processing and optical                    
              memories and other widespread applications such as optical neural              
              networks, optical communications, pattern recognition, laser                   
              printing and scanning, and visual displays, have been designed,                
              but require and presently lack high-performance, easily usable                 
              addressable arrays of light sources.  We propose to fulfill this               
              need by constructing arrays of individually electronically                     
              addressable vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser.  Their                     
              implementation into such systems will straightforwardly simplify               
              such systems and dramatically improve performance compare to                   
              alternative input light sources based on spatial light modulators              
              or fixed-mask inputs.  For optical processing systems such as                  
              those mentioned above, simplification occurs through elimination               
              of many unnecessary optical components.  Higher speed, more                    
              versatility and greater tolerance to varying device                            
              characteristics are the main forms of improved performance.                    
              Optical memories like compact disk or optical type would increase              
              their speeds many-fold by reading, for example, 64 bits at a time              
              rather than only one.  VCSEL's are fundamentally much better                   
              suited for these applications than the more mature edge-emitting               
              diode laser technology, mainly because they emit circular, low-                
              divergence beams, and they can be fabricated in arbitrary one- or              
              two- dimensional patterns.  The utility for such general-purpose               
              arrays (e.g. linear 1x64) is likely to range far beyond what we                
              can presently imagine.
