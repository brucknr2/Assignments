Abstract    :
              A new technique for depositing refractory metal                                
              coating in ceramics or semiconductors is suggested.                            
              The process is based upon liquid precursor which                               
              could be coated on semiconductor wafers using the                              
              same techniques which are currently used for liquid                            
              resist coatings. After baking, the liquid precursor is                         
              reduced to a refractory metal coating in hydrogen.                             
              Unlike metallization techniques which involve                                  
              sputtering or CVD, the process takes place entirely                            
              at atmospheric pressure, potentially reducing the                              
              complexity and cost of metallization.  Also, larger,                           
              complex surfaces can be coated potentially more                                
              easily than is possible by vacuum processes.
