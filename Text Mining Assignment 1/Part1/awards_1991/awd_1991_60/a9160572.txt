Abstract    :
                   Computing software for problems like seismic ray tracing and              
              travel time inversion in three-dimensional complex geologic media              
              often provides only local solutions, i.e., local optima, rather                
              than global solutions because of the "bumpiness" of the response               
              surface to be explored.  This research will develop algorithms                 
              that can escape from local optima using coarse grain parallel                  
              techniques.                                                                    
                   Global optimization techniques will be combined with local                
              optimization techniques to solve multiobjective optimization and               
              large inversion problems.  The key to the development of these                 
              algorithms is the efficient use of coarse grain parallelism                    
              operating asynchronously.
