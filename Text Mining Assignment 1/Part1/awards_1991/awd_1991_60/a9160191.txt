Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Improved reliable accelerometers suitable for wide deployment             
              in seismic arrays are needed for earthquake prediction studies.                
              In response to this need Optical Technologies, Inc. (OPTECH) is                
              proposing a fiber-optic accelerometer system that provides the                 
              desired performance improvements of broad-band, wide dynamic range,            
              and low power consumption, as well as other significant benefits               
              and features:                                                                  
                                                                                             
              o  Broad-band response (< 0.1 Hz to > 100 Hz)                                  
              o  Wide dynamic range (on the order of 140 to 160 dB)                          
              o  Low power consumption                                                       
              o  Robust construction (no moving parts)                                       
              o  Capability to operate in any orientation                                    
              o  Low maintenance cost                                                        
              o  High reliability (no moving parts)                                          
              o  High radiation tolerance (suitable for nuclear plant deployment)            
              o  Digital out (in Phase II)
