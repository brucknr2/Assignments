Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is              
              in the general area of chemical synthesis in the subfield of                   
              materials chemistry.  Zinc selenide (ZnSe) has important                       
              potential applications as a material for visible light emitting                
              devices and short wavelength lasers for display applications.                  
              Metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) of ZnSe is the                  
              most promising production method but is hampered by its use of                 
              hydrogen selenide, an extremely hazardous and toxic gas.                       
              Hydrogen selenide also has significant disadvantages because it                
              undergoes room temperature gas phase reaction with dialkylzinc                 
              reagents leading to poor growth uniformity and morphology.                     
              Initial attempts to replace hydrogen selenide with organoselenium              
              source reagents have met with limited success due to high growth               
              temperatures and carbon contamination of the deposited films.                  
              This Phase I program will investigate novel organoselenium                     
              reagents based on rational molecular design and understanding of               
              decomposition mechanisms.  Subsequent research will allow for the              
              scale-up and purification of the optimal reagent for the                       
              production of ZnSe.
