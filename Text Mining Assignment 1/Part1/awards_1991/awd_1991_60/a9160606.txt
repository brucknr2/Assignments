Abstract    :
              This research effort will implement a "smart cameras" (Fast 3D                 
              imaging camera, or F3D1) which will generate a full range map of               
              a manufacturing scene in real time with virtually no computation               
              required.  The same camera will also continue to function as a                 
              normal intensity based camera and can be switched from intensity               
              to range mode by switching a single binary line.  Today's robots               
              exploit cameras to capture images of the objects which require                 
              manipulation by the robot, and attempt to use that image data to               
              learn the exact position of parts, to identify problems, to                    
              inspect parts, to detect proximity, etc.  One of the problems                  
              which limits the use of machine vision in manufacturing                        
              environments is that camera images are two dimensional and the                 
              objects which must be manipulated are three dimensional.  Three                
              dimensional information is essential in most realistic                         
              applications, hence numerous techniques have been explored to                  
              generate depth information from 2D camera images.  None of these               
              techniques is ideal for factory application because each is                    
              either slow, costly, or inaccurate, or fails to work on objects                
              that are specular.  The novel technology being developed for the               
              F3D1 camera could have important applications in manufacturing                 
              and other settings.
