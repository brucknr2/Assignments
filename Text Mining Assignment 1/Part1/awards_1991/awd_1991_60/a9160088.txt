Abstract    :
              Management and search of large databases is a computational                    
              bottleneck in many domains.  One attractive approach to                        
              eliminating it is to exploit recent advances in parallel computer              
              hardware and processing.  However, the development of software                 
              that permits this represents one of the major challenges facing                
              computer scientists.  This project proposes to develop a generic               
              approach to parallel database management that should be                        
              especially suitable for large databases of complex objects in                  
              which even single object comparisons may be computationally                    
              costly.  (Examples include databases of image data, in which                   
              database search may require numerous comparisons of complicated                
              images.)  This approach is based on the use of Linda, a                        
              commercial product of Scientific Computing Associates, Inc.                    
              Linda systems provide convenient access to parallelism from                    
              within familiar high-level languages such as C or Fortran.  In                 
              Phase I, a fast text retrieval system will be developed for                    
              asynchronous multiprocessors.  This will serve as proof of                     
              concept for more general software to be investigated in Phase II               
              work.  Due to the use of Linda, the technology developed will be               
              not only efficient, but also portable across vastly different                  
              parallel architectures including both explicitly parallel                      
              computers and local-area networks of workstations functioning as               
              parallel "hypercomputers".
