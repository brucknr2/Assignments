Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Ultra-fine particles will be incorporated into pure magnesium by               
              pressure infiltration to form oxide dispersion strengthened (ODS)              
              magnesium.  These alloys will derive strength from the fine                    
              particles and resulting dislocation substructures.  By using                   
              particles which are thermally stable, the alloys will retain                   
              their strength at temperature for long periods of time.  Hot                   
              hardness tests conducted on the alloys will be used to measure                 
              strength at temperature.
