Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)  Phase 1 project is             
              in the general area of polymer modification in the subfield of                 
              organic synthesis.  The selection of a polymer for use in a                    
              biomedical application is based upon the physical characteristics              
              of the polymer such as strength and flexibility and upon the                   
              biocompatibility of the material with tissue.  Often compromises               
              must be made between these two conflicting requirements.  The                  
              ideal solution to this problem is to enable the selection of the               
              polymer based solely on the physical properties and then provide a             
              tenacious surface coating which imparts the required                           
              biocompatibility properties.  The coating reagent must be capable              
              of covalent bonding to a variety of polymer surfaces and imparting             
              the desired surface properties.                                                
                                                                                             
              This project will focus on the synthesis of new photoreactive                  
              groups having improved photocoupling capabilities including                    
              wavelength of activation and reactivity toward less reactive                   
              polymer surfaces.  These new reagents will be incorporated into                
              coating molecules to assess their ability to surface modify the                
              polymer.  Two representative coating systems will be                           
              investigated, one intended to impart a lubricous surface and the               
              other to generate a nonthrombogenic coating.  A variety of polymer             
              substrates will be utilized and these reagents will be used to                 
              coat devices provided by customers.
