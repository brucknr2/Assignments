Abstract    :
                   This research addresses the need for high brightness                      
              sources of high current pulsed electron beams through an in                    
              depth study of electron emission from ferroelectric materials.                 
              Recently copious emission of electrons has been observed from                  
              ferroelectric materials upon fast polarization change.  Using                  
              lead zirconium titanate (PZT) and lead lanthanam zirconium                     
              titanate (PLZT) electron emission current densities of                         
              100A/cm2 have been observed.  This current density is about an                 
              order of magnitude larger than possible with thermionic                        
              cathodes and close to the maximum obtained with laser driven                   
              photocathodes.  The ferroelectric source is a room temperature                 
              emitter with a theoretical brightness limit a 3.2X1012                         
              A/m2.rad2 which is an order of magnitude large than present                    
              photocathodes.  The beam emittance, brightness and spatial                     
              profile will be measured during Phase I.  This simple source                   
              has the potential to replace thermionic and photocathodes in                   
              advanced accelerators and RF sources.  The source is                           
              potentially attractive due to the high brightness obtainable                   
              with a simple system as compared to thermionic cathodes                        
              requiring pulsed bunching for high currents or photocathodes                   
              driven by large lasers.
