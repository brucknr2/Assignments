Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research  (SBIR) Phase 1 project is             
              in the general area of chemical synthesis in the subfield of                   
              chemical catalysis.  Enzyme catalyzed processes offer significant              
              advantages over traditional chemical methods in organic syntheses,             
              including superior efficiency, stereoselectivity, and specificity.             
              However, soluble and conventionally immobilized enzymes are often              
              inactive under typical laboratory or manufacturing conditions,                 
              which may include high temperatures, extremes of pH, near-                     
              anhydrous organic solvents, and mixed aqueous-organic solvents.                
              Enzyme crystals, cross-linked using a bifunctional reagent such as             
              glutaraldehyde, constitute a novel form of enzyme immobilization.              
              Such cross-linked enzyme crystals (CLECs) are superior to                      
              conventionally immobilized enzymes in many respects.  For example,             
              the crystal lattice interactions, supplemented by chemical cross-              
              links, provide the individual enzyme molecules within a CLEC with              
              an enhanced stability that enables CLECs to function in harsh                  
              environments (such as elevated temperatures and organic solvents)              
              that would not otherwise be compatible with catalytic activity.                
              These features make CLECs valuable as stereospecific catalytic                 
              reagents.  In this Phase I study, CLECs of pig liver esterase                  
              (PLE) and pig pancreatic lipase (PPL) will be investigated to                  
              demonstrate the practical feasibility of CLECs as laboratory                   
              catalysis in organic syntheses.  Esterase and lipase enzymes were              
              chosen for their superior catalytic characteristics compared with              
              current chemical methods for stereospecific hydrolysis and                     
              reduction.
