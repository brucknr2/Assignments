Abstract    :
                   This research is to analyze the performance requirements and              
              specifications for tooling used in the Super Plastic Forming (SPF)             
              process.  This will be followed by investigations of several                   
              refractory ceramic materials as potential candidates for tooling               
              to meet the demands of current SPF process and advanced SPF for                
              future high temperature metal alloys.  Integral heating of the                 
              tooling to perform SPF will also be considered.                                
                   SPF is finding wide use in the manufacture of complex shapes              
              for the aerospace applications from aluminum alloys, titanium                  
              alloys and other specialty materials.  The identification and                  
              development of superior tooling materials with integral heating for            
              advanced SPF, will be a considerable benefit to the metal-forming              
              industry.
