Abstract    :
                   Superconductivity is a phenomenon that has had tremendous                 
              publicity over the last few years.  The practical application of               
              high temperature oxide superconducting materials is in the early               
              stages of development.  For these oxide materials to be applied,               
              there must be a manufacturing process that allows the production               
              of long, continuous, uniform wires and strips.  This research will             
              explore a unique tubular wire manufacturing process that can allow             
              the production of unlimited length superconducting wires.  This                
              unique manufacturing process is intended to overcome the problems              
              with the conventional manufacturing method of packing a powder in              
              a fixed-length hollow tube, and can be applied to any                          
              superconducting powder and sheath material combination.  This                  
              process will be researched using the Bi-Pb-Sr-Ca-Cu-O powder and               
              Silver Sheath.  The consistency and the uniformity of                          
              superconducting wires will be evaluated.                                       
                   The results of this research will greatly accelerate the use              
              of high temperature superconductors because long uniform                       
              superconducting wires will be available for the manufacture of                 
              magnets, motors, generators, and magnetic resonance imaging                    
              equipment.
