Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              At the present time, very little in non-molecular biology "hands-              
              on" resources are commercially available for incorporation into                
              the classroom laboratory setting.  The primary focus of this                   
              research is to explore the feasibility and potential for                       
              accelerating the incorporation of various aspects of                           
              biotechnology into science curricula through the development of                
              educational support systems which integrate a variety of                       
              instructional materials.  The products of this research will                   
              integrate "hands-on" experiment modules, teacher instruction                   
              guides, and visual presentation materials in the basic sub-                    
              disciplines of biotechnology.
