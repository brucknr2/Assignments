Abstract    :
                   Finding numerical solutions is most efficient when the                    
              points where the function is to be evaluated are well-chosen;                  
              often this means using an adaptive plan where each choice may be               
              modified based on the previous choices and calculations already                
              made.  The object of this project is to develop an efficient new               
              methodology for generating the sequence of choices of points                   
              adaptively.                                                                    
                   The development of an adaptive strategy involving direct                  
              control over grid size should improve the accuracy of numerical                
              solutions while reducing computer time and storage.  This project              
              will develop such an adaptive grid procedure which also ensures                
              entanglement-free grids.
