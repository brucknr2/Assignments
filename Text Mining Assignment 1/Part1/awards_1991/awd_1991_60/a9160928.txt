Abstract    :
              This is a SBIR Phase I project.  The goal of the project is to                 
              develop an improved CCD camera for X-ray imaging system for                    
              protein crystallography.  The immediate objectives are to test                 
              the feasibility of using fiber optically coupled CCDs for protein              
              crystallography and to study methods for correcting the                        
              distortion in fiber optic bundles.  Cameras of the type proposed               
              here are expected to be suitable for a variety of medical,                     
              scientific and industrial radiography applications.
