Abstract    :
              The basic idea behind the proposed research is to establish                    
              multiple spatial channels at the same "frequency" -                            
              Spatial-Division Multiple Access - using parameter estimation                  
              techniques from array processing. Phase I efforts will include the             
              development of accurate software models of the electromagnetic                 
              environment, extensive simulation studies using the ESPRIT                     
              algorithm and other parameter estimation algorithms, and the                   
              development of signal detection, estimation, and demodulation                  
              techniques which can be used to accomplish the channel assignment.             
              These efforts will culminate in the specification of an                        
              experimental system which will be used to test the proposed                    
              techniques in a realistic environment.
