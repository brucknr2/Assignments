Abstract    :
                   This research effort is dedicated to the development of an                
              accurate instrument for the monitoring of temperature of molten                
              glass.  The sensor is based on the phenomenon called the                       
              Christiansen effect.  This is a phenomenon, exhibited by glass,                
              where the scattering and reflection of electromagnetic radiation               
              disappears.  Thus if the radiance of a material at the Christiansen            
              frequency is measured, the temperature of the surface of the                   
              material can be obtained.  By utilizing shorter wavelengths, the               
              depth of penetration into the material can be increased and a                  
              temperature profile of the bulk of the material can be obtained by             
              measuring the radiance.                                                        
                   This low-cost, accurate sensor will offer significant benefits            
              to the glass manufacturing processes, by improving their ability               
              to control the manufacturing process.  It will enable the industry             
              to improve quality and throughput while potentially reducing the               
              energy use in the process.  The competitiveness of the domestic                
              industry will be enhanced as a result.
