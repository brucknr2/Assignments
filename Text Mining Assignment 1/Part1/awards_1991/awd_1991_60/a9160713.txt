Abstract    :
                   This research will study a novel embedded self-locking                    
              technique as an approach to second-harmonic generation (SHG)                   
              of a diode laser output in an external unidirectional resonant                 
              ring cavity.  The proposed scheme is capable of providing both                 
              high conversion efficiency and good spatial beam quality with                  
              very low amplitude noise, and has two other advantages over                    
              previous cavity and feedback schemes.  First, it allows linear                 
              polarization to be maintained within the external cavity,                      
              which is necessary for an efficient Type I SHG.  Second, the                   
              use of a three-mirror unidirectional resonant cavity, instead                  
              of the standing wave cavity, will substantially improve the                    
              SHG efficiency.  Furthermore, the three-mirror triangular                      
              cavity design is easy to align and maintain high position-                     
              stability, when compared to the four-mirror cavity approach.                   
              The novel power-build-up resonant cavity proposed in this                      
              approach offers a promise of a fundamental power-enhancement                   
              factor of 200 and an external SGH conversion efficiency over                   
              40%.
