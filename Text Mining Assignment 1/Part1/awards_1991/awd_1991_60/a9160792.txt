Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Intelligent Tutoring Systems show promise for improving the                    
              efficiency of teaching by tailoring instruction to each student's              
              needs. This research proposes two innovations over current                     
              tutoring methods.  The first, is interest based, i.e.,                         
              instruction based on the basis of a model of the student's                     
              interest.  The second, is the use of multiple intelligent agents               
              to deliver individualized instruction and engage in collaborative              
              problem solving with the student.  The end use of the research                 
              will include commercial games that teach scientific and                        
              mathematical domains.
