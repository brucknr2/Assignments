Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Leading scientists and educators have stressed critical thinking               
              problem solving as top priorities for science education.  A                    
              neglected aspect of this broad area is the ability to make good                
              decisions through logical habits of thought relating knowledge,                
              uncertainty and human values. This project will seek to establish              
              the feasibility of developing educational materials and teacher                
              workshops to help science teachers incorporate these skills into               
              existing science units which address important problem relating                
              to science, technology and society. If use of these materials in               
              schools increases the ability of youth to make wise decisions,                 
              the effort can contribute to economic competitiveness.
