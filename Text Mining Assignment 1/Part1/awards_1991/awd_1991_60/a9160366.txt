Abstract    :
              The removal of hardened photoresist                                            
              layers by plasma ashing in an                                                  
              important process tool frequently                                              
              used in the lithographic processing                                            
              of microelectronic and

              existing techniques for plasma

              performance.  While UV photo ashing                                            
              avoids radiation damage from plasma

              very low throughput.                                                           
                                                                                             
              We propose a newly developed dual
