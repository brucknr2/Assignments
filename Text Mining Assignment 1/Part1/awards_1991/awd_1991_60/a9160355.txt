Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The objective of this program is to achieve strength and                  
              reliability improvements in structural ceramics through ion                    
              implantation.  The approach is to produce precipitable phases by               
              high dose ion implantation and subsequent annealing.  The                      
              strength increase is expected from the localized volume expansion              
              of the implanted region due to the presence of these precipitates              
              resulting in the generation of compressive surface stresses.  If               
              thermodynamically stable precipitates are formed, then a                       
              temperature independent increase in strength and reliability is                
              expected.  If the precipitate phase is harder than the matrix, a               
              surface hardening should result.                                               
                   In Phase I, it is proposed to co-implant silicon and carbon,              
              and titanium and carbon into silicon nitride to study the                      
              formation of silicon carbide and titanium carbide precipitates.                
              Characterization is performed by using transmission electron                   
              microscopy.  Four-point-bend testing provides strength and                     
              reliability data.
