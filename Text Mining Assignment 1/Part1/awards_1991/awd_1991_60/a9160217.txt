Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Many substrates are not amenable to diamond coating because               
              the correct processing technologies require operation at elevated              
              pressures and temperatures which can be deleterious to the                     
              substrate.  This project will utilize a unique pulsed fast atom                
              source to develop diamond coatings on substrates held at low                   
              temperatures.  The fast beam can provide high concentrations of C              
              and H atoms in the same ratio as utilized in PCVD processes but at             
              very high velocities.  Upon impact the high velocity, short                    
              duration ( 30 s) beam will transfer energy to the surface,                   
              heating a microlayer to elevated temperatures and/or enabling                  
              chemical barriers to diamond film growth to be surmounted.  This               
              approach avoids the requirements of bulk substrate heating.  The               
              Phase I effort will be directed towards a laboratory demonstration             
              for the potential of using our fast beam technology for diamond                
              coating of low temperature substrates.  The successful completion              
              of the Phase I effort will allow the utilization of diamond films              
              on advanced substrates which would be affected adversely by the                
              environmental conditions required in extant diamond coating                    
              processes.
