Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              All-optical switching devices are crucial to realize optical                   
              computers which offer ultra-fast information processing.  To                   
              date, many switching concepts have been investigated, but most                 
              suffer from speed, efficiency, reliability, size and cost                      
              limitations.  Optivision, Inc. proposes to design, fabricate and               
              evaluate a novel all-optical switching device based on nonlinear               
              bimodal fiber-optic interferometry using LP01-LP02 modes.  A                   
              bimodal polymer fiber (BPF) is spliced through two bi-tapers                   
              between two single mode fibers (SMFs).  The field access for high              
              sensitivity to the polymer refractive index is the particular bi-              
              tapers to be exploited.  This results in a coupling-beating-                   
              coupling structure in the SMF/BPF/SMF arrangement with the                     
              beating of LP01-LP02 modes optically controlled by a Kerr-like                 
              nonlinear polymer.  The Kerr-induced nonlinear differential phase              
              shift in the BPF controls the optical coupling at the BPF/SMF                  
              interface. The fabricated switch will be configured as a building              
              block for logic gate operations.  Using fiber-optic amplifiers,                
              these all-fiber logic gates can be cascaded and have large fan-                
              out.  In addition, they will be fast, compact, with low power                  
              consumption and low cost, and are compatible with the fiber optic              
              networks of the future advanced photonic communication and                     
              computer designs to satisfy expected heavy demand on the                       
              information handling capacity.
