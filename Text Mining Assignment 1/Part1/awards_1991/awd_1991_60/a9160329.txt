Abstract    :
              POC proposes to develop a totally new lensless                                 
              lithography machine using a combination of                                     
              microprisms and waveguide holograms which will                                 
              produce images within a sub 0.25um resolution.                                 
              This machine will have high resolution, large field                            
              masks, and minimum aberration.  Both theoretical                               
              and experimental efforts will be made in Phase I to                            
              fully determine the limits of this approach and the                            
              possibility of designing a practical lithography                               
              machine for integrated circuit applications.                                   
              Technical issues including material requirements,                              
              diffraction limits of different holographic optical                            
              systems (HOS), aberration                                                      
              magnification/demagnification, noise elimination                               
              and power distribution and uniformity will                                     
              intensively studied.  Holographic materials that can                           
              provide image resolution<0.1um are available for                               
              this program based on POC's proprietary HOE                                    
              fabrication techniques.
