Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Compared to current technology, the required refrigerators                     
              must be more compact and reliable, require no maintenance or                   
              skill to operate, achieve much longer operating lifetimes, and                 
                                                                                             
              pump up to several watts of heat, yet cost only a fraction of                  
              the rest of the electronic system.  These objectives are not                   
              achieved in practice due to mechanical, thermal, and fluid                     
              flow irreversibilities which are inherent in conventional                      
              design, materials, and manufacturing processes.  Through                       
              silicon micromachining, fundamentally lossy mechanical                         
              components can be eliminated and special materials properties                  
              can be exploited, while thermal and fluid flow contributions                   
              to entropy generation can be controlled.  Under current NSF                    
              SGER funding the P.I. designed an experimental apparatus.  The                 
                                                                                             
              construction of this apparatus is the goal for Phase I.                        
              Successful results will provide a foundation for the                           
              engineering of Stirling microrefrigerators, that will expand                   
              its range of applications for cold electronics.                                
                                                                                             
              Stirling microfrigerators would increase the speed of computer                 
                                                                                             
              processors and memories; and reduce noise in radio and                         
              microwave detectors, amplifiers, and filters; reduce the bulk                  
              of infra-red detection and imaging systems; and facilitate the
