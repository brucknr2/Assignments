Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The proposed project includes monitoring global deep                      
              convection via ionospheric potential because thunderstorm                      
              development is extremely sensitive to surface temperature.  The                
              proposed technology will take advantage of the characteristics of              
              the atmospheric electrical global circuit so that just one reliable            
              measurement of ionospheric potential at any sub-auroral latitude               
              will serve as globally representative data.
