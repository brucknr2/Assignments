Abstract    :
              The objective of this research is to create a "wearable"                       
              information system device that can be used by supervisory personnel            
              that provides up-to-date project information such as budget,                   
              schedule, and change order details and enables the supervisor to               
              easily and accurately record job progress and construction site                
              conditions.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              The research will focus on the creation of a prototype apparatus               
              using commercially available components such as a portable micro-              
              computer, a miniature display monitor, a voice recognition system,             
              and a bar code reader.  The interfacing devices( monitor,                      
              microphone, and speakers), will be fitted to a standard                        
              construction hard hat.  Additionally, a voice-activated menuing                
              system will provide the field supervisor with an array of site                 
              management applications.  Finally a detailed set of design                     
              specifications will be developed which can be used to construct the            
              next generation of wearable information systems for construction               
              sites.
