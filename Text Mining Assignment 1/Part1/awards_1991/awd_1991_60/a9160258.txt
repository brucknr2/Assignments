Abstract    :
                   Real-time monitors are designed to filter and analyze patterns in         
              collections of incoming data streams--for example, to convert low-             
              level signal and image data into high-level descriptions.  In short,           
              they are a solution to the "data fusion" problem.  This project                
              implements the process-trellis software architecture as a programming          
              methodology and tool for building parallel real-time monitors.  The            
              project will enable data fusion applications to exploit new                    
              developments in parallel computer hardware and processing.                     
                   The process trellis supports hierarchical, multiprocess data              
              fusion structures that convert incoming raw data into high-level               
              abstractions.  Intermediate processing is performed by numerous                
              analysis procedures running asynchronously and in parallel,                    
              interacting only through the flow of data in the trellis.  The trellis         
              will be implemented using Linda (R), a commercial product of                   
              SCIENTIFIC Computing Associates, Inc., that provides convenient access         
              to parallelism from within high-level languages like C or Fortran.             
              This will lead to software that is not only efficient, but also                
              portable across vastly different parallel architectures including both         
              explicitly parallel computers and LANS of workstations functioning as          
              parallel "hypercomputers."
