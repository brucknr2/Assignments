Abstract    :
              Effective communications are essential to the success of an effort             
              to conduct scientific investigations over an area of continental               
              size.  Communications in the polar regions are difficult because               
              of the often great distances involved, the disturbed ionosphere,               
              and the general inaccessibility of the great bulk of satellite                 
              communications resources which are in equatorial orbit.  A new                 
              class of communication satellites, the relatively small and                    
              inexpensive "microsats", will over the next few years provide an               
              alternate method for communicating with equipment and personnel in             
              the field.                                                                     
              Interferometrics proposes to conduct research to adapt an existing             
              design for a compact telemetry unit (CTU) to the environment of the            
              polar regions and the needs of polar science.  The existing CTU                
              operates autonomously, gathering data as commanded.  Command and               
              interrogation is done remotely via a digital packet radio network              
              which can include a data store-and-forward or relay satellite.  The            
              same system can be used to exchange message communications.  The               
              challenge to be met is to design equipment which will operate                  
              reliably in the particularly hostile environment of the polar                  
              regions, while providing the required level of service.  A simpler,            
              hand-held version of the CTU could be used for personal                        
              radiolocation if used with appropriate satellite equipment.
