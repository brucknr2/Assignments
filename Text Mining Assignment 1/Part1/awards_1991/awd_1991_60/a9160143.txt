Abstract    :
              The solid-gas adsorption system utilizing zeolites has the                     
              unique capability of converting small temperature variations                   
              into large pressure variations.  This permits the waste heat                   
              to be converted to useful work by small, inexpensive and                       
              efficient devices.  The proposal is concerned with identifying                 
              the best zeolite/gas combinations for such applications and                    
              generate, through testing, property information not readily                    
              available.  Also to be included is the identification of                       
              problems to be investigated in Phase II.
