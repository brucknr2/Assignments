Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              High speed optical links are finding ever increasing uses in                   
              optical communications and signal processing applications.                     
              Currently available planar waveguide lasers used in these links                
              suffer from a high insertion loss due to a mode mismatch between               
              the fiber and the modulator and the inability to implement a 2D                
              array configurations.  The vertical cavity surface emitting                    
              lasers (VCSEL) currently under development at several U.S.                     
              labs address these problems.  These VCSEL devices consists of a                
              quantum well Fabry-Perot cavity sandwiched between n and p doped               
              high reflectivity mirrors.  Vertical cavity lasers, however                    
              suffer from a high contact resistance due to a doughnut shape top              
              electrode.  This leads to increased heat and current crowding in               
              the laser.  We propose to eliminate this problem by depositing a               
              transparent top electrode made from single crystal GaN.  GaN is                
              transparent to IR and visible and forms a ohmic contact to heavy               
              doped GaAs.  The Phase I program will determine if the VCSEL is                
              damaged during the GaN deposition and measure the improvement in               
              the top contact resistance.  This will be followed by developing               
              2D fiber pigtailed VCSEL modules with monolithic detectors in                  
              Phase II.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              Anticipated Benefits:  The proposed VCSEL modules and the                      
              developed technology form the basis of several high speed                      
              modulator, laser and optical interconnect devices.  These offer                
              unique system architectural possibilities for future DOD and                   
              commercial systems.
