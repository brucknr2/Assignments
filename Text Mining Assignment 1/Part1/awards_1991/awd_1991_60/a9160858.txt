Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Two new tunable laser materials discovered at Lawrence Livermore               
              National Laboratory have shown intrinsic efficiency comparable                 
              to alexandrite; however, their full potential laser performance                
              is limited by the quality of crystals available.  The major                    
              impediment to the commercialization of the new laser materials is              
              the high optical scatter loss, and cracking of crystals.  The                  
              proposed program is to adapt the Heat Exchanger Method (HEMtm)                 
              for growth of the new materials.  Low temperature gradients will               
              be utilized to minimize defects and scattering losses due to                   
              variations in stoichiometry.  The cracking problem is attributed               
              to a negative thermal expansion coefficient along the C axis and               
              stress in the crystal after growth.  The shape of the solid-                   
              liquid interface during growth will be controlled such that                    
              solidification occurs off the interface in preference to off the               
              crucible wall.  In situ annealing will be carried out to minimize              
              stress and temperature gradients on the crystal during cooldown.
