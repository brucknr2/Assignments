Abstract    :
              This project will focus on the synthesis and analysis of polymer               
              that could be used for controlled drug release using injectable                
              microcapsules.  The researchers are attempting to develop a                    
              polymer that would degrade over a time period of one to four                   
              weeks, be biocompatible and exhibit desirable physical                         
              characteristics that are required in order to be made into                     
              microcapsules.  It is proposed that salts of polyesters of lactic              
              and glycolic acids be used.  These materials will be prepared                  
              using a process patented by the PI.  The physical properties of                
              such materials will be examined during the Phase I project.  The               
              results of this project could lead to a new class of needed,                   
              medically useful, materials for drug release and the results                   
              could have a substantial impact in the field.
