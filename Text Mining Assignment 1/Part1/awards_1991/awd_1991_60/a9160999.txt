Abstract    :
              One of the major limiting factors in the                                       
              development of X-ray lithography is the                                        
              lack of an optimum mask material.  The                                         
              combined requirements of X-ray a nd                                            
              optical transparency, toughness, high                                          
              yield strength and sufficient internal                                         
              stress to maintain flatness, limit the                                         
              list of candidate materials for                                                
              membranes.  Of the various materials                                           
              studied over the past several years                                            
              diamond is an extremely good candidate                                         
              for an X-ray membrane.  The X-ray mask                                         
              structure requires the formation of an                                         
              extremely adherent, high atomic number                                         
              absorber on the membrane.  At the same                                         
              time the absorber layer should not                                             
              develop internal stresses during                                               
              deposition as this will lead to pattern                                        
              distortions following subsequent etching                                       
              and processing steps.  Metallic                                                
              diamondlike nanocomposites can be                                              
              synthesized virtually stress-free and                                          
              exhibit extremely good adhesion to                                             
              virtually any substrate.  The phase I                                          
              proposal seeks to optimize the synthesis                                       
              of X-ray mask structures consisting of a                                       
              diamond membrane and a W-diamondlike                                           
              nanocomposite absorber.
