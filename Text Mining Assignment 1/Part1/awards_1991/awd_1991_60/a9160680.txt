Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              During the past year, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) has been               
              successful in fabricating holographic rugate structures for the UV,            
              visible, and very near IR regions of the spectrum.  These                      
              holographic mirrors demonstrated laser damage thresholds which were            
              5 times better than the best dielectric multilayer coatings, with              
              reflectivities in excess of 99.9%.  This research project proposes             
              to extend this holographic rugate technology to the region from 1              
              um to 3um.  The holographic recording process for the IR region                
              should also yield ultra high damage thresholds and be easily                   
              scalable to very large optics.  The holographic processes employed             
              use low temperature deposition methods and an integration of                   
              holographic coatings with gratings.  These gratings can be used as             
              beam samplers to output couplers.  The potential for a simple                  
              fabrication process, low absorption characteristics of the                     
              recording medium, and a demonstrated radiation harness make POC'S              
              coating process an ideal new technology for civilian and military              
              applications.  POC's approach will greatly reduce structural                   
              weight, thermal load and cost compared to existing coating                     
              technologies since it can be applied to light-weigh substrates such            
              as graphic-epoxy, mylar, aluminum, and ultra-thin glass.  Moreover,            
              initial experimental results have demonstrated that the coating has            
              no degrassing problem.
