Abstract    :
              Though radioactivity is widely used in bioassays due to its high               
              sensitivity and convenience, safety and environmental concerns                 
              have accelerated efforts to eliminate its use.  Several recent                 
              examples of procedures using luminescence have surpassed                       
              conventional isotopic methods.  Among these, luminescence of                   
              firefly luciferase is the most efficient known.  The                           
              investigators have completed significant new research advancing                
              the knowledge of the enzymatic mechanism of firefly luciferase.                
              The new chemistry provides greater luminescence intensity with                 
              simpler reaction kinetics.  To gain a broader perspective of                   
              properties of beetle luciferases and to develop enzymes better                 
              suited to commercial applications, the investigators propose to                
              examine the structure and function of several divergent isozymes               
              by using cDNA clones already isolated coding for these isozymes.               
              Phase I will assess the feasibility of this proposal by                        
              expressing and purifying the cloned luciferases in E.coli                      
              developing methods for random mutagenesis, and initiating                      
              crystallization studies.  Phase II will focus on characterizing                
              the recombinant luciferases, examining their relative structural               
              relationships, enhancing their properties by random mutagenesis,               
              and generating protein crystals of the new isozymes.  Phase III                
              efforts will use the knowledge acquired on enzyme property                     
              enhancement to develop a number of bioassay-related and other                  
              commercial applications.
