Abstract    :
                   The research will develop a new technique for materials                   
              processing.  The technique will demonstrate the fabrication of a               
              composite Nb3Sn superconductor and will offer the promise of                   
              greater economy in manufacture and improved performance.  In the               
              technique, a ductile matrix contains particles of a brittle                    
              material that are made to deform by the hydrostatic force in the               
              ductile matrix.  The material in wire form will be heated briefly              
              to a temperature above the recrystallization temperature of the                
              ductile component that will transmit the deformation force                     
              hydrostatically to the brittle component.  The wire will be heated             
              at die entrance, deformed in the die, and quenched at die exit.                
              The time at temperature for any point on the wire will be only a               
              few seconds and undesired diffusion will not occur.                            
                   The research should produce more reliable and economical Nb3Sn            
              conductors for fusion energy device magnets, NMR Magnets,                      
              Accelerator Magnets, etc. and provide new techniques for the                   
              deformation of brittle                                                         
              powders.
