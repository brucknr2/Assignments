Abstract    :
                   The efficient modeling of groundwater movement allows                     
              analysis and prediction of the response of aquifers to changes in              
              conditions.  This project will undertake the developmental work                
              for a compact, portable and user-friendly simulation model to be               
              used for monitoring pollutant transport.                                       
                   This work is based on the boundary integral equation method               
              where both hydraulic conductivity and boundary conditions are                  
              taken to be random.  This formulation will allow robust                        
              sensitivity analysis and inference about the range of variability              
              as well as simulation of flows.
