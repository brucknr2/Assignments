Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The existing computer programs for simulation of the motion of                 
              multi-body mechanical systems generally require excessive                      
              execution time for realistic systems and this renders them not                 
              suitable or inconvenient for use in design phase.  Additionally,               
              these programs do not have good provisions for common drive                    
              subsystems which often involve planar linkages or geared                       
              mechanisms.  A dynamic formulation methodology based on the                    
              recognition that a large number of mechanical system can be                    
              modeled as consisting of an open loop chain or tree of bodies,                 
              which are the primary links of the system, and their drive                     
              subsystems, which together with the primary links always form                  
              local closed kinematic loops.  The proposed research is to                     
              develop such a methodology that calls for the identification of                
              independent generalized coordinates for the local closed loop                  
              through graph representation concept and kinematic analysis, the               
              use of efficient recursive formalism for the primary chain or                  
              tree and the derivation of additional contributions from the                   
              local closed loops.  It is anticipated that a user-friendly and                
              computationally efficient program can evolve from this research                
              and can be made commercially available to the public.  The                     
              resulted program can enable mechanical system designers to                     
              perform effective simulation in the various design phases to                   
              reduce the design turn-around time and the design costs, and to                
              improve the quality of design.
