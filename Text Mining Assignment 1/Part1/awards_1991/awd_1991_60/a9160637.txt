Abstract    :
              This is a SBIR Phase I project.  Recently, a method was                        
              introduced in which on the order of 100 to 1,000 different                     
              peptides could be synthesized on a solid support.  The                         
              development of a significant improvement to this technique is                  
              proposed.  The object of this research is to demonstrate the                   
              potential of the improved system to synthesize megapeptide arrays              
              (1 - 10 M different peptides).  Successful completion of this                  
              research will result in determination of the critical parameters               
              required for the synthesis of megapeptide arrays.
