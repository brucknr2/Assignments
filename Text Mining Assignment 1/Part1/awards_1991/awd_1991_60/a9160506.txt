Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is              
              in the general area instrumentation development in the subfield                
              of infrared spectrometry.  Conventional methods of infrared (IR)               
              spectroscopy utilize either a small throughout (IR flux) optical               
              element for dispersion followed a detector (or array), or a large              
              throughout, scanning interferometer followed by a detector.  A                 
              new, smart detector design is proposed here for accomplishing                  
              transform spectroscopy of infrared light directly on the detector              
              chip itself.  The new method is a large throughput transform                   
              technique which incorporates the multiplex advantage without                   
              requiring a mechanically scanned interferometer.  This new                     
              spectrometer is potentially very small, compact, and rugged,                   
              especially if it is fabricated on a silicon wafer substrate, as                
              is planned (i.e., a spectrometer on a chip).  This opto-                       
              electronic device structure can also be adapted to other IR                    
              instrument technologies.  During this Phase I project these                    
              investigators will make a first loop on the full design and                    
              concept testing for the graded interference-filter spectrometer                
              device.  The concept for this new device for IR transform                      
              spectroscopy arises out of several areas of strength within the                
              research staff at Advanced Fuel Research, Inc., hence the                      
              potential for success is large.
