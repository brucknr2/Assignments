Abstract    :
                   This project addresses the need of the applications specialist            
              for advanced mathematical programming methods without the heavy                
              investment of time which is normally required.  It aims to provide             
              advanced modeling aids for setting up Lagrangean Techniques which are          
              usually indispensable when dealing with large complex problems.  This          
              will be accomplished by imbedding Lagrangean Modeling into an                  
              interactive environment under state-of-the-art systems such as GAMS            
              and MPSX/370.  The user will be guided in setting up models and                
              associated Lagrangean Techniques without having to code the details.           
              He will be led by the system and will be able to try out various               
              options before committing to a final set of decisions (how to                  
              decompose, how to set the various parameters, how to select from a set         
              of specialized solvers, how to guide the Lagrangean Dual solution              
              procedures, etc.)  Various algorithmic devices will be provided as             
              needed, including: solving the Lagrangean Dual by subgradient                  
              optimization or dual ascent; providing an overall Branch and Bound             
              shell; making available special purpose algorithms; modifying GAMS to          
              take advantage of the decomposition; introducing advanced integer              
              programming (logical processing, probing) and heuristics.
