Abstract    :
              High-surface-area doped stannic oxide electrodes are prepared                  
              using porous titanium substrates; the dopants include                          
              antimony, bismuth, and arsenic.  The electrodes are tested as                  
              anodes for the electrolyses of phenol, aniline, EDTA, and                      
              chlorophenol.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              Toxic organic compounds are present in the waste streams of                    
              many industries, including textiles, petroleum products, pulp                  
              and paper, and organic chemicals.  Present methods are either                  
              unable to reduce concentrations to acceptable levels or                        
              produce toxic solid wastes that pose another problem.                          
              Efficient electrochemical destruction may be an attractive                     
              option in many cases.
