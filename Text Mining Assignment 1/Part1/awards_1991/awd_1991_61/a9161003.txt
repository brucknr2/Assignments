Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The steadily increasing consumption of seafood and the relative                
              decline in harvest from the capture fishery is expected to lead                
              to increased importance of aquaculture production of edible fish               
              in the U.S. and throughout the world. However, increased                       
              production of marine finfish will require improvements in                      
              hatchery production of larvae, which is currently hampered by an               
              inadequate supply of larval food.                                              
                                                                                             
              The rotifer, Brachionus plicatilis, is an important food for                   
              larval fish. Specialized nutritional requirements of rotifers and              
              fish larvae increase their production costs. The difficulty in                 
              supplying sufficient quantities and qualities of rotifers is a                 
              major impediment to larval fish production.  This research is to               
              develop low cost, high quality feeds for the mass production of                
              rotifers by using heterotrophically grown microalgae.  the                     
              development of these feeds should significantly decrease costs                 
              of producing rotifers, while at the same time improve the larval               
              fish survival rates and overall of finfish production.
