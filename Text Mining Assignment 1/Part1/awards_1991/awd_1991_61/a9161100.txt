Abstract    :
              The proposed research will entail the development of a ASIC for                
              amplifying complex signals at very high clock rates. The efficacy              
              of this approach (which depends on a prior development by Mixtec)              
              at very high clock rates will be demonstrated by a prototype                   
              circuit and computer simulation.
