Abstract    :
              High purity, submicron, spherical, high surface area particles                 
              of covalent ceramics are key to achieving high density                         
              materials, which exhibit high strength and creep resistance at                 
              high temperatures.  Currently available covalent ceramic                       
              particles, lead to poor high temperature strength and creep                    
              resistance.  This program will investigate a simple process                    
              that will produce stoichiometric high purity, submicron,                       
              spherical ceramic particles with a very high surface area                      
              which will allow for self sintering of covalently bonded                       
              ceramics.  The particle synthesis process consists in                          
              evaporating high purity silicon into a plasma of nitrogen or                   
              methane to produce Si3N4 or SiC particles.  The properties of                  
              the sintered ceramic will be assessed.                                         
                                                                                             
              It is expected that the sintered particles, produced at                        
              substantial savings, will replace existing materials and                       
              expand the market in automotive, aerospace, all engines                        
              conversion, wear and cutting tools.
