Abstract    :
              An accurate and versatile computer-                                            
              based testbed for designing                                                    
              printed-circuit antennas and arrays                                            
              will be developed.  The testbed                                                
              will include pre- and post-                                                    
              processing tasks, e.g. specifying                                              
              geometries, varying geometrical                                                
              parameters for a given design,                                                 
              display of simulation results.                                                 
              Furthermore, appropriate databases                                             
              will be utilized for design                                                    
              sensitivity analysis.                                                          
                                                                                             
              The goal of phase I will be to                                                 
              demonstrate the viability of the                                               
              integrated, user-friendly front-end                                            
              or the graphical user interface.                                               
              By linking the interface to an                                                 
              existing analysis routine for a                                                
              single-layer microstrip,                                                       
              sensitivity studies will be                                                    
              exploited.  In Phase II, the                                                   
              testbed will be expanded to include                                            
              new analysis with more efficient                                               
              algorithms for complex structures                                              
              and a capability to cut masks using                                            
              standard plotters.
