Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Future optical interconnect architectures with vertical and                    
              lateral paths will need to be silicon-based for integration of                 
              waveguides, modulators, and detectors with microelectronics.                   
              Current research efforts concentrate on operation beyond the                   
              band-edge wavelength of 1.12 um, where silicon is nominally                    
              transparent.  Potential integration of optoelectronic devices at               
              wafer level may lead to the development of optical                             
              interconnection technologies based on infrared light sources at                
              1.3um.  Recent research in this area indicates that a refractive               
              index change as large as 0.01 can be achieved in silicon even                  
              though silicon does not exhibit a linear electrooptic effect.                  
              This electrically induced refractive index change is based on the              
              free-carrier effect, (e.g., in a p-n junction) and can be used                 
              for light modulation.  Physical Optics Corporation proposes to                 
              use its holographic recording of photoresist gratings to develop               
              an optical modulator based on a waveguide grating coupler.  The                
              coupling efficiency can be modulated by very small changes of                  
              refractive index in the structure because of the narrow                        
              acceptance angle of the guided mode.  Full modulation depth of                 
              the guided wave can be achieved with current densities under 10                
              uA/um2.  This structure can be also used for spatial light                     
              modulators.
