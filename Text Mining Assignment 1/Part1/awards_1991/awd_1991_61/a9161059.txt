Abstract    :
                   This project is funded under the National Science Foundation's            
              (NSF) Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program, which is              
              designed to provide an opportunity for small business, particularly            
              the small high technology firm, to participate in NSF research.                
              Phase I of the SBIR program serves as a filter to select promising             
              proposals and determine if the firm can do high quality research.              
              Phase II is the principal research project.  Phase III is the                  
              conversion of the NSF-funded research into commercial applications             
              and technological innovation supported by follow-on private                    
              venture capital or other non-federal financing.                                
                   This Phase I project is researching a novel frequency hopping             
              code division multiple access (FH/CDMA) personal communications                
              network.  This mobile cellular communications system, designed to              
              maximize the number of users per cell, can operate in a frequency              
              band containing other users.  To maximize the number of users,                 
              synchronous FH/CDMA is being employed.  Forward error correction               
              and erasure detection and correction are being employed since                  
              interference can be detected.  Slow and fast hopping is being                  
              studied to optimize performance in a multipath environment.  Also,             
              standard hopping codes such as PN and Gold are being compared with             
              some new ideas on hop codes such as Reed-Solomon hopping patterns.
