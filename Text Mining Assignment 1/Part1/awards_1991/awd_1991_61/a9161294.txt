Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The purpose of this research is a study on the needs of disabled               
              people and their ability to use a computer to learn math,                      
              science, and engineering in schools.  The Human Performance Model              
              will be used to study the degree to which disabled and able-                   
              bodied students benefit from using alternative, membrane computer              
              keyboards with custom overlays.  The goal is to determine whether              
              one can isolate the factors that help disabled people use                      
              computers with less error, greater speed, and greater ease.
