Abstract    :
              Investigating Automated Biomonitoring as a Management Tool                     
              Toward the Elimination of Pollutants that Adversely Affect                     
              Aquatic Environmental Quality.                                                 
                                                                                             
              This award is to support Phase I research to determine the                     
              feasibility of using fish ventilatory response profiles in                     
              an automated and continuously monitored system to detect                       
              toxicity of effluents from wastewater collection and                           
              treatment systems.  The involves assessment of those                           
              profiles to determine or predict the cause of toxicity and                     
              to relate fish responses such as cough behavior, activity                      
              patters and orientation behavior to the pollutant-                             
              exposures.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              The proposal leading to this award was submitted in                            
              response to NSF 91-20, Small Business Innovation Research                      
              (SBIR).  Results of this research are expected to                              
              determine the technical feasibility of the proposed                            
              concept and the basis for potential continuation of the                        
              research into a subsequent Phase II.
