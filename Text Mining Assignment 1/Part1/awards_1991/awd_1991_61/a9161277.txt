Abstract    :
              The objective of this effort is a continuous process that                      
              converts methane to methanol.  The strategy is to convert                      
              methane first to a methyl halide using a solid electrolyte to                  
              remove the hydrogen ions formed, and to then hydrolyze the                     
              halide over a basic catalyst.  Perovskites of various types                    
              can perform all these roles, and the process depends on                        
              finding a suitable mixed perovskite membrane.                                  
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
              If such a system demonstrated high efficiency and reasonable                   
              operating life, the commercial potential would be enormous.                    
              Easy conversion of natural gas to a liquid fuel or a chemical                  
              feedstock could revolutionize the economics of energy                          
              production.
