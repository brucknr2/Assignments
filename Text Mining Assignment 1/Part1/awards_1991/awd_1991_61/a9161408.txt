Abstract    :
              The objective of the present proposal is the                                   
              development of some mathematical and computational                             
              tools that are appropriate to the next generation of                           
              CACSD (Computer Aided Control System Design)                                   
              environments.  These future CACSD packages will be                             
              radically different from the present packages in that                          
              they will truly be able to perform control systems                             
              synthesis and rapid prototyping, rather than just                              
              analysis and simulation.  A key role in this is played by                      
              the integration of modeling, system identification, and                        
              robust control design.  The long range goals address                           
              the following problems: (i) estimation of model                                
              accuracy from measured and prior data, (ii) tuning of                          
              the identification experiment for robust controller                            
              design, (iii) development of reliable and efficient                            
              algorithms, and (iv) development of an interactive                             
              object oriented environment which is sensible for a                            
              wide variety of users.  Phase I of the proposed research                       
              is directed towards the feasibility of solving these                           
              problems.  Phase II will extend the results of Phase I as                      
              well as develop the corresponding software primitives.
