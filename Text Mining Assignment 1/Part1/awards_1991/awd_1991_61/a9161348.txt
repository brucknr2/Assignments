Abstract    :
              Significant research and                                                       
              development is being conducted in                                              
              near infrared and infrared lasers                                              
              with an emphasis on Q-switched                                                 
              pulsed lasers.  This presents an                                               
              opportunity to investigate the                                                 
              feasibility of three new Q-switch                                              
              devices for lasers operating in the                                            
              one to three micron region.                                                    
              Specifically, we propose three new                                             
              devices.  First, is a new Brewster                                             
              window "Zig Zag" acousto-optic Q-                                              
              switch device suitable for multi-                                              
              wavelength laser operation which                                               
              can be inserted in to the laser                                                
              cavity without requiring major                                                 
              realignment.  The second Q-switch                                              
              device also works in the Zig Zag                                               
              configuration, but utilizes the                                                
              grating electro-optic effect for                                               
              ultra fast (up to a few                                                        
              nanoseconds) switching at a much                                               
              lower drive voltage than                                                       
              conventional electro-optic Q-                                                  
              switches.  The third Q-switch                                                  
              device allows a very simple single                                             
              frequency laser cavity, and this                                               
              new laser will produce an extremely                                            
              stable and low noise output beam.
