Abstract    :
              In the next decade indium phosphide based lasers                               
              are expected to be critically important in integrated                          
              electrooptic devices and fiber optics communication                            
              due to their high speed and bandgap in the near                                
              infrared spectral region.  Semi-insulating titanium                            
              doped indium phosphide is required for fabrication                             
              of high speed, high power, low threshold, long                                 
              lasting lasers with low leakage currents.  This                                
              material cannot currently be fabricated by                                     
              MOCVD, which is a preferred method of                                          
              manufacture, due to the low volatility and instability                         
              of the available titanium source reagents.  In Phase                           
              I five new titanium source reagents specifically                               
              engineered for high volatility will be synthesized                             
              and tested as InP dopants.
