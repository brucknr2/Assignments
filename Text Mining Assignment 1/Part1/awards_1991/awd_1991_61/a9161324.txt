Abstract    :
              A Phase I SBIR award will fund preliminary evaluation of a volume-             
              specific, limited-scan photon backscatter technique for rapid non-             
              destructive determination of the composition and thickness of                  
              hidden layers, such as subcoating corrosion.  Initial analytical               
              studies will determine proper selections of source and beam                    
              collimation, source energy and placement of source-object-detector.            
              Experimental verification will follow and the sensitivity of the               
              technique will be determined.
