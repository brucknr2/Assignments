Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Optical lithography is widely used in the manufacture of                       
              integrated circuits.  The current systems utilize conventional I-              
              line (356nm wavelength) lamps or to illuminate the lenses that                 
              print the IC patterns onto wafers.  Future systems will use                    
              laser.  All of the lithography optics used to date have been the               
              refractive type.  At the short ultraviolet (UV) laser wavelengths              
              required for next generation device manufacturing, several                     
              limitations exist for this type of lens.  These limitations                    
              include light scattering because of shot wavelengths, heat                     
              absorption due to high photon energies in the UV, and optical                  
              transmission losses (poor efficiency) from high absorption of the              
              light.                                                                         
                                                                                             
              The PI propose to develop a catadioptric optical system that has               
              high optical transmission, high resolution, is laser-resistant,                
              and relatively easy to manufacture.  Because the optics are                    
              mirror-based, optical distortion is greatly reduced and very high              
              power levels can be used without damaging the optics.  We have                 
              made preliminary experiments in our lab with this type of optics,              
              and achieved 0.4um resolution.  The development of this type of                
              lens would lead to significant improvements in the high                        
              resolution imaging systems for VLSI microlithography, a critical               
              step in manufacturing integrate circuits.
