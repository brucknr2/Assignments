Abstract    :
              Spire recently demonstrated bright                                             
              visible light emission from Silicon                                            
              quantum wires.  Silicon substrates                                             
              were electrochemically etched to                                               
              produce a porous surface with                                                  
              nanometer size Si columns (quantum                                             
              wires).  When excited with a blue                                              
              laser beam, or UV light                                                        
              (photoluminescence), or when                                                   
              immersed in an H2O:NaC1 electrolyte                                            
              under an electric field, the                                                   
              treated samples emitted very bright                                            
              red light.  Moreover, we                                                       
              demonstrated that it is possible to                                            
              tailor the emission spectrum by                                                
              anodizing Si-based alloys such as                                              
              Si1-xGex or ion implanted Si (e.g.,                                            
              Er+-implanted Si).  If strong                                                  
              electroluminescence (EL) can be                                                
              demonstrated in this material then                                             
              the driver electronics and light-                                              
              emitting elements of a flat panel                                              
              display can be integrated into the                                             
              same Si substrate.  This                                                       
              development would result in                                                    
              significant reduction of display                                               
              panel fabrication steps and cost.                                              
              We believe that these recent                                                   
              findings, combined with mature Si                                              
              electronics technology, offer a                                                
              rare opportunity for a major

              display technology.                                                            
                                                                                             
              We propose a program to investigate                                            
              fabrication of monochrome or multi-                                            
              color Si flat-panel displays.  In                                              
              Phase I, we will optimize                                                      
              processing of Si quantum wires and                                             
              study electroluminescent behavior.                                             
              Individual test structures will be

              demonstrated.  In Phase II, we will                                            
              fabricate multi-pixel monochrome Si                                            
              EL displays and explore fabrication
