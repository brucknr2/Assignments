Abstract    :
              This project will concentrate on the design of a socket for a                  
              lower-limb protheses which can be adjusted by the user.  This                  
              highly innovative idea will use a bladder-like lining in the                   
              socket-stump interface.  The bladder will be filled with a fluid               
              and subsequently hardened after the stump is inserted into the                 
              socket.  The hardness will be a function of the temperature if the             
              substance.  A material will be chosen so that it will return to a              
              gel-like state upon reaching a certain temperature so that                     
              refitting of the socket-stump interface by the user will be                    
              possible.  If successful this prosthetic design could have a                   
              tremendous advantage over classical lower limb prosthetic devices              
              which require that adjustments be made by prosthetist.
