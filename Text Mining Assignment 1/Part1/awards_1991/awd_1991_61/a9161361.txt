Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The PIs propose to increase the utility of a variety of                   
              existing radar systems through the design and construction of a                
              flexible, high-performance radar processor.  On the basis of recent            
              tests at Arecibo Observatory, Puerto Rico, major improvements in               
              the resolution and accuracy of the incoherent scatter observations             
              were achieved through the implementation of computationally                    
              intensive radar techniques.  Other radar systems can be used to                
              monitor the geospace environment and man-made modifications to the             
              upper atmosphere.  This project is aimed at expanding the scope of             
              research performed at several national observatories and greatly               
              increase the amount of information that can be extracted from                  
              existing atmospheric radars.
