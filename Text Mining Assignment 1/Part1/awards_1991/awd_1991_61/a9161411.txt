Abstract    :
                   This project is funded under the National Science Foundation's            
              (NSF) Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program, which is              
              designed to provide an opportunity for small business, particularly            
              the small high technology firm, to participate in NSF research.                
              Phase I of the SBIR program serves as a filter to select promising             
              proposals and determine if the firm can do high quality research.              
              Phase II is the principal research project.  Phase III is the                  
              conversion of the NSF-funded research into commercial applications             
              and technological innovation supported by follow-on private venture            
              capital or other non-federal financing.                                        
                   The objective of this Phase I project is to develop a                     
              cost-effective multiwavelength local area network based  on                    
              combining the best attributes of both wavelength-division                      
              multiplexing and Fiber Distributed Data Interface into a unique                
              network referred to as Highly Parallel Wavelength Distributed Data             
              Interface (HPWDDI).  The research emphasis is on the technological             
              choices and economic evaluation of the physical layer                          
              implementation.  An exploratory multi-channel single-mode HPWDDI               
              system is being designed, built and evaluated to demonstrate the               
              feasibility of the concept and its capability for interactive                  
              multimedia communications.
