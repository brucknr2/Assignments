Abstract    :
              This study attempts to capitalize on the recent observation                    
              that very high photoefficiencies can be obtained for the                       
              semiconductor-catalyzed oxidative mineralization of                            
              trichloroethylene in the gas phase.  A systematic study of the                 
              dependence of the photoefficiency on vapor composition, nature                 
              and deployment of photocatalyst, wavelength and intensity of                   
              radiation, and temperature is conducted in bench-top fixed-bed                 
              reactors; the goal is to optimize the photoefficiency and                      
              obtain information on the chemistry of the system.  The study                  
              will also be expanded to other compounds, including                            
              chloroform, methyl chloroform, perchlorethylene, isooctane,                    
              and toluene.                                                                   
                                                                                             
              The phenomenon has great potential as the basis of a cost-                     
              effective technology, suitable for retrofit, for destroying                    
              volatile organic pollutants in systems for air or steam                        
              stripping of polluted water or soil, ventilation of industrial                 
              or transportation systems, and such highly polluting                           
              operations as painting and printing.
