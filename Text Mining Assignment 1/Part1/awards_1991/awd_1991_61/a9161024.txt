Abstract    :
                   The objective of the research is to explore the feasibility               
              of developing compact, high concentration, ozone generation                    
              equipment for the demanding requirements of the semiconductor                  
              manufacturing and materials processing industry.  Emerging                     
              processing technologies using ozone chemistry have given rise to               
              the need for such equipment.  Current generators are inadequate for            
              the task and too large to be installed in the clean room                       
              environment next to the chemical vapor deposition system or other              
              semiconductor tool.  Current double-cooled generator designs also              
              require a dielectric coolant and a dedicated recirculating oil                 
              cooling system to remove heat from the generator electrodes.                   
                   The experimental program will be directed toward establishing             
              the feasibility of developing a compact generator module and                   
              excitation source with the required performance.
