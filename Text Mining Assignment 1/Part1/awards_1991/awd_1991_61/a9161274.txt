Abstract    :
              This work is to make available a multiple-stimulator tactile                   
              array device mounted on a mouse.  This device will provide a                   
              capability for the finger to sense patterns, texture or                        
              variations in the surface of an image.  It is designed                         
              specifically to provide tactile perception of surface texture in               
              images derived from a scanning tunneling electron microscope                   
              (STM).  The electrical potentials generated by the scanning tip                
              of an STM are translated into multiple-colored pictures                        
              portraying surface geometry.  This device will augment visual                  
              output to enable multi-sensory perception in STM and it will be                
              useful in many other human-computer interacton environments.
