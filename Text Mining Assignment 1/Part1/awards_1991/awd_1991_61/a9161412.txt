Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project addresses machine cutting of threads, a key                       
              step in reliably manufacturing many products.  The research                    
              intent is improving the process for enhanced accuracy.                         
              This will be accomplished by using nonlinear piezoactuators                    
              controlled by neural nets to obtain 5 arc minutes accuracy                     
              in positioning a cutting tool.  Specifically, in Phase I,                      
              neural networks will learn to control a highly nonlinear                       
              set of piezoactuators as simulated on a computer, whereas                      
              in Phase II, a machine tool will be instrumented to                            
              demonstrate the concept in hardware.  Tool positioning                         
              information will be supplied by a laser measurement device                     
              already available.  There are many types of metal cutting                      
              operations where this technology could be applied to reduce                    
              waste and improve quality.  The utility of the neural                          
              network is apparent since it can learn to compensate for                       
              many repeatable variables in the machining operation and                       
              also compensate for tool wear.
