Abstract    :
                   This research effort is designed to develop an advanced system            
              for the manufacturing of rotationally-symmetric diffractive optics             
              with continuous profiles in photopolymer materials.  The emphasis,             
              in this work, is the integration of computer-aided optical design              
              and a controlled manufacturing process to develop a complete                   
              manufacturing system.  The manufacturing process will be based on              
              a combination of single-point diamond turning and laser                        
              photolithographic fabrication technique.  A high-precision laser               
              writing machine will be the result, to enable the cost-effective               
              fabrication of high-quality, diffractive optical elements.                     
                   Diffractive optical elements are encountering widespread                  
              usage, primarily because of the tremendous advantages they offer               
              over conventional refractive and reflective optical elements.                  
              Developing the ability to manufacture diffractive optical elements             
              with a high degree of efficiency would be of significant benefit               
              to the domestic optic industry.
