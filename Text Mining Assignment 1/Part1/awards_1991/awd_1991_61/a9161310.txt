Abstract    :
              Significant advances in earthquake                                             
              engineering have been made but the                                             
              expertise is too often confined to                                             
              universities and government                                                    
              institutions.  Bodies of knowledge                                             
              which would significantly aid                                                  
              decision makers across all segments                                            
              of society (business, inventors,                                               
              planners, etc.) are not readily

              This project addresses the
