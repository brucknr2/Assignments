Abstract    :
              Aquanautics Corporation synthesizes and characterizes                          
              oxygen binding complexes.  These compounds are intended                        
              for commercial applications ranging from oxygen removal                        
              (for example, beverage oxygen filters) to low power oxygen                     
              production (for example, the "artificial gill").  This                         
              project is to exploit some of these compounds as agents to                     
              facilitate oxygen flux to Saccharomyces cerevisae (Baker's                     
              yeast) and mammalian cells.                                                    
                                                                                             
              The objective of this proposal is twofold.  One is to show                     
              that protozoan and metazoan cultures are compatible with                       
              transition metal binding compounds. The other is to                            
              demonstrate that such an additive will enable the                              
              maintenance of higher cell densities or higher cell                            
              metabolism rates.  If this research is successful, the                         
              cell genetic products can be produced more economically.
