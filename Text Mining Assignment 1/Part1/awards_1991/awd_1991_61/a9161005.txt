Abstract    :
              A method of beverage (wine, fruit juice) deoxygenation has                     
              been developed using electrochemically regenerated metal                       
              chelates to remove the oxygen from a recycling gas stream.                     
              The gas stream which is used to deoxygenate the beverage                       
              is fed to the electrochemically regenerated metal chelate                      
              solution where the oxygen is selectively removed.  The gas                     
              is then returned to the beverage to further deoxygenate                        
              the fluid.  The system has the advantage that flavor                           
              components are not removed.  The reaction of the metal                         
              chelates with the oxygen is not completely effficient,                         
              resulting in the production of off-flavors.  This project                      
              addresses this chemistry which must be improved before the                     
              system can be practical.  Metal chelate chemistry in the                       
              presence of oxygen and beverage flavor components is to be                     
              studied.
