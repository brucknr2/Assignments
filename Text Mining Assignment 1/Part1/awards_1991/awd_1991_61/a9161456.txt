Abstract    :
                   This research activity is designed to develop a non-invasive              
              technique for the monitoring of plasma reactors.  The basis for                
              this approach is the phenomenon of Laser Induced Fluorescence (LIF)            
              which can be used to conduct three-dimensional mapping of the                  
              plasma properties.  This will be analyzed to provide quantitative              
              information on constituent species, detection of appearance or                 
              disappearance of species and contaminants, and end point detection.            
              The technique will also develop innovative methods to perform rapid            
              scanning with a high degree of accuracy and sensitivity.  The                  
              technique can be used to provide reliable monitoring to enable                 
              process control of the dry plasma process.                                     
                   The dry plasma process is widely used for the manufacturing               
              of semi-conductor devices.  The ability to implement closed loop               
              control will have significant impact on the yield and efficiency               
              of the process with large benefits to a vital industry segment.
