Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A method is proposed to develop metal matrix composites (MMC)                  
              with high directional thermal conductivities for use in the                    
              electronic components as packaging material to promote heat                    
              dissipation.  Since thermal management is one of the critical                  
              aspects of packaging design, lifetime and performance of                       
              electronic components can be increased dramatically if such a                  
              material is economically feasible.  Such a material could have                 
              significant economic impact.  The proposed method is to                        
              utilize commercially available graphite fibers employing fiber                 
              spreading in a pneumatic and liquid flow field, followed by                    
              uniform deposition of copper or aluminum on the spread fibers                  
              by hollow cathode plasma technique.  A thin interface layer of                 
              Si or Mo will be applied if necessary, to improve adhesion and                 
              better translation of mechanical or thermal properties.  The                   
              coated fibers will then be weaved or placed in desired                         
              architecture and consolidated at 50 to 80% of melting                          
              temperature.  The resulting material is expected to have high                  
              thermal conductivities (600 W/mK) in X and Z directions.
