Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Four of the most important surface analytical techniques for                   
              materials science are: (1) Auger Electron Spectrometry, (2) X-                 
              ray Photo-electron Spectrometry, (3) Secondary Ion Mass                        
              Spectrometry, and (4) Rutherford Backscattering Spectrometry.                  
              While of widespread use, there has not been a concomitant                      
              increase in their emphasis at educational institutions.  The                   
              research effort in this project is the creation of a Computer-                 
              Aided Instruction (CAI) laboratory resource for surface analysis               
              education. Instrumental, experimental, and theoretical                         
              considerations for the techniques will be presented along with                 
              the ability to design and conduct hypothetical experiments.
