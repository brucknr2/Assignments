Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase 1 project is in the              
              general area of chemical synthesis in the subfield of chemical                 
              catalysis.  Ethylene glycol is an important commodity chemical                 
              with a world market valued at over $3 billion per year.  Ethylene              
              glycol is currently synthesized by the epoxidation of ethylene to              
              ethylene oxide followed by hydration.  For a process of such large             
              scale, there are significant incentives to developing a more                   
              economical synthesis based on cheaper raw materials and a less                 
              capital intensive process.                                                     
                                                                                             
              In this Phase I proposal a route for the synthesis of ethylene                 
              glycol based on ethane is outlined.  This work elaborates on                   
              active research at Catalytica aimed at the discovery of novel                  
              systems that allow the conversion of methane to methanol with high             
              selectivity via two consecutive selective oxidations of each                   
              methyl group, to the formation of ethylene glycol.  The phase I                
              research objectives are to study factors that influence the                    
              regiospecificity in the consecutive oxidation reactions from                   
              ethane to ethylene glycol.
