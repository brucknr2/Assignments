Abstract    :
                   The new light valve, based on a novel two-layer architecture,             
              provides significantly higher aperture ratio/pixel density                     
              combinations than any of the currently available or proposed light             
              valves.  The use of polymer dispersed liquid crystal (PDLC) is                 
              selected as the choice LC medium for this application.  The                    
              combined VLSI/PDLC light valve will result in fabrication of an                
              ultraminiature light valve with a projected cost factor which is               
              approximately an order of magnitude less than competing (lower                 
              resolution) displays currently under development.  The research                
              effort will be devoted to a feasibility study which will involve               
              construction, testing and evaluation of the first experimental                 
              prototype valve based on combined VLSI/PDLC technologies.                      
                   The work represents a new, innovative approach in the                     
              development of improved high resolution displays.  The core feature            
              of this new display centers on construction of a revolutionary new             
              light valve which combines state-of-the-art capabilities in very-              
              large-scale-integration (VLSI) and liquid crystal (LC)                         
              technologies.
