Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a SBIR Phase I effort.  This work is to determine the                  
              feasibility of developing remote voice interface which addresses               
              the problem of handling users' spontaneous correction of their                 
              own errors or of those made by a listener.  In this case the                   
              listener is a speech recognition system.  The objectives include               
              building a linguist model for error correction using the taking                
              of telephone numbers as an example.  Based on these results,                   
              vocabulary and grammar models for error correction will be                     
              created, using existing tools, and integrated in their Soliloquy               
              voice interface software system and then an evaluation will be                 
              performed.  Applications include remote data entry, database                   
              inquiries, computer control, call sorting and other environments.
