Abstract    :
                   A critical issue in the development of digital high-definition            
              television (HDTV) is the reliable transmission of high-quality                 
              video images with minimum transmission bandwidth.  This creates a              
              need for efficient data compression algorithms for digitized image             
              sequences.  However, existing video compression techniques, such as            
              the CCITT standard, cannot consistently achieve high compression               
              ratios.  This study will involve an examination of two                         
              multiresolution representations, the development of motion                     
              estimation algorithms, and an evalutation of compression                       
              performance on selected video imagery.                                         
                   The reviewers comment on the high quality of the proposal, the            
              science, the research plan and the qualifications of the PI and key            
              staff.  They point out areas where more detail in the proposal                 
              regarding the approach would have been helpful, but they are                   
              confident of the commercial viablilty in the potentially huge HDTV             
              market .  One reviewer states that the concepts are well known in              
              academia and may have already been investigated.  Program staff                
              agrees with the high ratings of the two subpanelists, and believes             
              that while the concepts are known in academia, the implementation              
              proposed by the principal investigator has not been done.
