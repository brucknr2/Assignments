Abstract    :
                                                                                              
               Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and related processes have been              
              developed as a means of producing synthetic diamond at relatively              
              low temperatures and pressures.  However, in spite of recent                   
              progress, CVD diamond is less than satisfactory because the                    
              deposits are polycrystalline in form with grains of varying sizes              
              and orientations.                                                              
                   Ion implantation of diamond and polycrystalline diamond (an               
              alternative technique) creates substantial radiation damage,                   
              amorphization, and ultimately graphitization.  The ion bombarded               
              layers created on diamond substrates are substantially softer than             
              the bulk materials, and are therefore much easier to polish.  This             
              project will provide a proof-of-principle study, demonstrating a               
              process for polishing polycrystalline diamond which consists of ion            
              implantation followed by mechanical polishing.  Optical quality                
              finishes significantly better than those which can be obtained from            
              mechanical polishing alone are produced by such sequential                     
              implantation and polishing; it is anticipated that this process                
              will significantly simplify the polishing of polycrystalline                   
              diamond.
