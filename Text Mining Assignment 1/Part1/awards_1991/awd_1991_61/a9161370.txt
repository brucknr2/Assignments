Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The objective of this work is to design a condensation nucleus            
              counter capable of counting particles as small as 0.003 um at                  
              pressures ranging from 10 to 1000 mbar.  The heat and mass transfer            
              processes in the condensation nucleus counter will be modeled                  
              numerically.  Condensational droplet growth with heat dissipation              
              will be modelled analytically.  The model will be verified to the              
              extent possible by comparison with existing models and data from a             
              condensation nucleus counter which has been used for stratospheric             
              particle measurements.  Model results will be used to design an                
              improved condensation nucleus counter.  Parameters to be optimized             
              include flow rates, working fluid, condenser and saturator                     
              temperatures and condenser length.
