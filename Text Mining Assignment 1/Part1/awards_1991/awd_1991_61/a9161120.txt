Abstract    :
              Pesticide use on plant crops pose long-term effects to human                   
              health and the environment.  The U.S. Forest Service, Pacific                  
              Northwest Region, in a Draft Environmental Impact Statement                    
              (1989) has adopted a pest management policy which gives                        
              preference to non-chemical control measures.  Reliable non-                    
              chemical control is not available for fungal root diseases of                  
              conifer seedlings, therefore chemicals remain in use.                          
              Environmentally safe strains of microorganisms can effectively                 
              protect plants from root diseases.  Furthermore, new methods have              
              been developed for coating seeds with these beneficial organisms.              
              As yet, these new technologies have not been applied to forest                 
              nurseries.  This research project will elevate biological control              
              organisms and current seed coating technology for biological                   
              disease control in barefoot forest nurseries.  The control of                  
              damping-off and root rot diseases of Douglas-fir by Pythium,                   
              Fusarium, Phytophthora and Cylindrocarpon will be elevated.  The               
              data obtained will assist in the production of a seed coating                  
              product which would be available to federal, state and private                 
              forest nurseries.  The product will be adaptable to food crops as              
              well as horticultural and ornamental industries.
