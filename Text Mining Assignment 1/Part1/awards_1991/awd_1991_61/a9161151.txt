Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The primary objective of the research is to determine the                      
              feasibility of increasing the quantity and quality of science                  
              education in elementary schools through utilizing science                      
              education as the content for a relatively new addition to the                  
              elementary school curriculum, Foreign Language.  The potential of              
              level III interactive videodisc technology as a teacher training               
              medium to prepare and encourage Foreign Language in the                        
              Elementary School teachers to utilize science as their content.                
              In Phase I a prototype authored checkdisc to test the concept.
