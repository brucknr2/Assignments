Abstract    :
              The flatjack is an hydraulicly pressured bladder which will                    
              measure in-situ stress and modulus of elasticity of a masonry                  
              wall panel.  The research will investigate the use of polymer                  
              materials with fiber reinforcement to develop the equipment.  The              
              equipment will be validated under known conditions of stress in                
              test wall panels.
