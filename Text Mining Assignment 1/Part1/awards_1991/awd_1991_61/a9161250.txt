Abstract    :
              This work is to make available an autostereoscopic display for                 
              teleobotic applications.  User dissatisfaction with awkward 3D                 
              display technologies tends to negate the benefits of 3D                        
              visualization.  This effort uses an autostereoscopic LCD display               
              to provide a compact and portable systems for 3D display.  It                  
              avoids the use of special glasses or head-mounted display devices              
              to achieve 3D perspective.  The user's left and right eyes                     
              received binocular images and produces a visual perception of                  
              objects such that the user has the impression of looking through               
              the display window rather than looking at the display screen.                  
              The use of this device in telerobotic systems will enable the                  
              user to view the end-effector and manipulated objects with                     
              greater utilization of human perception and with increased                     
              precision and safety.//
