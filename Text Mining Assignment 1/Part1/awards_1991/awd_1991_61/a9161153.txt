Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The research is to demonstrate the feasibility of a software                   
              shell that will allow teachers and others interested in                        
              scientific education to construct specific "experiments" on                    
              personal computers.  The resulting programs or experiments will,               
              by virtue of the built-in utilities and simulation packages,                   
              provide lively interactive programs that students can use to                   
              explore scientific concepts in a non-threatening, self-paced                   
              manner.  A partnership has been established with the North                     
              Carolina Science and Mathematics Alliance to identify teachers                 
              who will help in the design and testing of the shell.
