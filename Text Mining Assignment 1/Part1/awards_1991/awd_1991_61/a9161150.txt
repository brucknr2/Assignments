Abstract    :
                   Gas-assisted injection molding process has been claimed by its            
              proponents as the most important development for the injection                 
              molding process since the invention of reciprocating-screw                     
              injection molding machine.  This process consists of a partial                 
              injection of polymer melt to the mold cavity followed by an                    
              injection of compressed gas which penetrates and, in principle,                
              hollows out a network of pre-designed, thick-section gas channels              
              until the cavity is filled.  When the process is well developed and            
              understood, it can produce many injection molded parts with light              
              weight and high rigidity and will provide tremendous flexibility               
              in the design of plastic parts.                                                
                   The analysis of the process involves flow of two drastically              
              different materials in a geometrically complicated mold cavity.                
              This study is aimed at establishing the scientific basis and                   
              attaining an engineering solution for characterizing this                      
              innovative process.  Successful results of this research would not             
              only expedite the development and acceptance of this process, but              
              also may add a new dimension to the plastic part design.
