Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The objective of the research is to develop courseware to enhance              
              student understanding of fluid dynamic concepts and his/her                    
              awareness of complex phenomena.  The courseware will be based on               
              an existing fluid flow modeling computer program.  Development of              
              one classroom fluid flow experiment will be undertaken.
