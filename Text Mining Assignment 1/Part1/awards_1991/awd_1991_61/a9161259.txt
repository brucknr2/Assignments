Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Research is proposed to investigate the efficacy of systolic                   
              compression/expansion (SEC) load balancing for scalable                        
              concurrent visualization systems (SCVS).  The approach used is                 
              based on a Newtonian derivation for the equation of motion                     
              describing the message-passing flow between neighboring                        
              multicomputer computation elements.  An assessment of graphical                
              primitive quantum size representation for geometry, silicon                    
              process technology, and message-passing rates will lead to an                  
              effective metric for predicting the instantaneous load-balance,                
              and systolically managing the update of SCVS display subsystem.                
              The SCVS will be simulated via a physical concurrency emulation                
              of the logically concurrent process structure required to                      
              implement a message-passing system for rendering graphical                     
              datasets in a shared-memory.  This simulation will serve as the                
              foundation for load balance monitoring studies based on a                      
              parametric test matrix of input conditions, such as user                       
              transformation rate, and geometric quanta size representation.
