Abstract    :
              This research is concerned with investigating the use of a 3D                  
              packaging architecture along with memory and an active substrate               
              to achieve low-power low-weight mass storage for use in laptop and             
              notebook computers.  The effort combines high density 3D packaging             
              of conventional, domestically available SRAM devices with active               
              mounting substrates that control the device power dissipation in               
              the standby mode.  A 50-megabyte hard disk replacement will consume            
              .5 cubic inch and have negligible impact on battery run-down time.             
              In addition, access time will reduce from milliseconds to less than            
              100 nanoseconds.  This research effort will analytically verify the            
              concept feasibility, design test articles, and develop an                      
              experimental test plan.
