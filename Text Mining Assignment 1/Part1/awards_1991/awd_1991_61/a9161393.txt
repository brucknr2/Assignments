Abstract    :
                   New technologies for producing useful products with engineered            
              microstructure and properties for optimized mechanical performance             
              creates an insatiable demand for materials processing and                      
              manufacturing.  Plasma assisted chemical vapor deposition (PACVD)              
              is a new technique for materials processing that has the capability            
              to substantially enhance deposition rates.  "Working" of a                     
              deposition surface can cause continued renucleation to produce a               
              very fine grained deposit, defect and stress free that is smooth               
              to virtually any thickness with substantially improved mechanical              
              properties.                                                                    
                   The program will develop a high watt density plasma chemical              
              vapor deposition (CVD) process coupled with continual in- situ                 
              "working" of the deposition surface to achieve extraordinarily high            
              deposition rates in a very fine grained stress free deposits with              
              mechanical properties substantially greater than conventional                  
              materials.  The process will be demonstrated with difficult to                 
              fabricate refractory materials.
