Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Research and development of a technology that will allow the                   
              manufacture of very high resolution autostereoscopic (3D)                      
              displays for advanced computer applications is proposed.  This                 
              innovative technology will provide the scientific community a                  
              true 3D alternative to current 3D and 2D imaging systems.  A                   
              method that allows the display of images with a resolution                     
              greater than the pixel count of the LCD itself has been devised.               
              Use of this method may allow the production of autostereoscopic                
              displays with an image quality matching that of high-end CRTs.                 
              Initial applications in advanced scientific computing include                  
              molecular modeling and MRI.
