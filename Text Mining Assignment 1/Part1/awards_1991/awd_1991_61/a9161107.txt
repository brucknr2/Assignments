Abstract    :
              The proposed research intends to develop a highly integrated                   
              package that will allow the forest manager to use forest stand                 
              information contained within a geographic information system                   
              (GIS), as input into a forest growth and yield model (FGYM).                   
              Spatially oriented projections of future stand volume will be                  
              created for incorporation into the GIS.  The projections will                  
              also be used as input into a timber harvest optimization routine               
              (THOR).  The optimization routine will give the forest manager                 
              the economically optimum and scheduling solution that meets mill,              
              harvesting equipment, and personnel constraints.  This package                 
              will be microcomputer based and rely on the Erdas 'GISMO' GIS                  
              modelling language.  Initial program development will focus on                 
              the Great Lakes region.  The program architecture will be robust,              
              thus permitting export to other forest regions and to                          
              agriculture.
