Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This program addresses the need for development of thin                        
              ceramic membranes for achieving reliable oxygen separation at                  
              elevated temperatures.  Technical effort will be directed                      
              towards development of ambient temperature electrolytic                        
              technique for the preparation of thin film ceramic mixed ionic                 
              and electronic conductors (MIEC) for use as oxygen separation                  
              membranes.  These membranes will be based on perovskites of                    
              compositions RE1-xAxCo                                                         
              1-yByO3-a (where the rare earth metal (RE) will be selected from               
              La, Nd, Sm, Gd, Dy, Er, Yb; A from Ba, Sr, and Ca and B from                   
              Fe, Ni, Ag and Cu.  This will be performed by initially                        
              preparing a tape cast conductive cermet of carbon and yttria                   
              stabilized zirconia (YSZ) by mixing graphite and YSZ powder                    
              followed by sintering the mixture under an inert atmosphere                    
              such as argon or nitrogen.  This structure will serve two                      
              purposes:  first it will provide a conductive substrate onto                   
              which electrodeposition of pervskite films can be performed,                   
              and secondly by taking the cermet and electrodeposited film up                 
              to 700-900 degrees celsius under air the graphite will burn                    
              out leaving a highly porous YSZ structure onto which the                       
              pervskite film is supported.  The performance characteristics                  
              of MIEC membranes supported on porous YSZ for separation of                    
              atmospheric oxygen at elevated temperatures will be                            
              determined.//
