Abstract    :
              Viscoelastic materials are one method of providing damping to                  
              structures when subjected to earthquake forces.  Previous materials            
              have degraded in stiffness and lost their effectiveness.                       
                                                                                             
              This investigation is to devise a material systems which will not              
              degrade as a result of heat generation.
