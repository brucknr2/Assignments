Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The primary objective of the research is to describe a                         
              methodology for developing an interactive multimedia environment               
              that motivates young students to pursue paths of learning in                   
              science and mathematics.  A varied assortment of technologies and              
              instructional techniques will be employed to create engaging                   
              learning environment that intuitively illustrates the meaning and              
              significance of complex scientific principles and mathematical                 
              relationships.  An emphasis will be placed on constructing an                  
              environment that is sensitive to the needs of under-represented                
              groups in the sciences.
