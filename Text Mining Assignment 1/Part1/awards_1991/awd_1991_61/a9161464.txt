Abstract    :
              Marine aquaculture represents a                                                
              growing industry and as this                                                   
              industry grows the potential for                                               
              pollution by wastes associated with                                            
              fish culture and fish processing                                               
              increases.  There is a significant                                             
              amount of biological waste arising                                             
              from undigested feed and other fish                                            
              waste as well as non-edible parts                                              
              of the final product.  Because                                                 
              these wastes are of a biological                                               
              nature, they may have some uses in

              This research is directed toward                                               
              developing techniques to separate                                              
              and collect both fish culture                                                  
              wastes and fish processing wastes                                              
              produced by a fish culture system.                                             
              The usefulness of the waste as a                                               
              feed ingredient in fish feed, and
