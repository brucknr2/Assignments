Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This study looks at the feasibility of producing fiber-reinforced              
              diamond composites specifically for structural and tribological                
              applications.  Phase I research involves increasing the toughness              
              of diamond matrix composites by adding continuous silicon carbide              
              fiber reinforcement and by modifying the fiber/matrix interface.               
              Mechanical properties such as, strength, strain-to-failure, and                
              fiber pullout length are determined in bending and tensile                     
              testing at the Materials Department, University of California,                 
              Santa Barbara.  The long term goal is a new class of composite                 
              materials which are tough and have high thermal conductivity and               
              more corrosion and wear resistance than current ceramic                        
              composites.
