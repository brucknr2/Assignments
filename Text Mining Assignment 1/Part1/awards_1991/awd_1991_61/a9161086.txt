Abstract    :
              Commercially available ion-selective membranes are modified to                 
              better meet the needs of electro-organic synthetic processes.                  
              The process under study is the conversion of formaldehyde to                   
              ethylene glycol.  The transport of all species present in                      
              several versions of this process is tracked for several state-                 
              of-the-art membranes, and correlated with current density,                     
              temperature, and electrolyte flow.  A working model of                         
              membrane transport is developed.  Membranes are modified to                    
              minimize solvent and neutral molecule diffusion.                               
                                                                                             
              Most electrochemical membranes used today were designed either                 
              for the chloralkali industry or for electrodialysis; an                        
              electro-organic process, however, places very  different                       
              requirements on the membranes.  Ion-exchange membranes                         
              designed specifically for organic electrosynthesis will                        
              provide increased efficiency for a number of electrochemical                   
              processes, including production of ethylene glycol.
