Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The objective of this research is to investigate various                  
              options to deploy a suitable UHF/VHF radar at sea using an                     
              anchored buoy.  The design includes the preferred operating                    
              frequency, antenna size, buoy size, power consumption, and                     
              various options to stabilize or exploit the motion of the buoy.
