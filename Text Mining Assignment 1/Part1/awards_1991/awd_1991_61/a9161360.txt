Abstract    :
                   This research will produce silicon drift photodiodes, which               
              are a derivative of devices which are at present being developed               
              for applications in other disciplines (high energy physics),                   
              while optimizing their quantum efficiency at blue-green (400 to                
              500 nm) wavelengths.  This will be done by preforming an                       
              "optimized" series of p+ diffusions to the front (light-                       
              sensitive) surface of the device.  Fabrication of these devices                
              will be performed at the Massachusetts Microelectronic Center,                 
              and testing will be done at RMD and the University of Lowell.                  
              These silicon drift photodiodes can be made with very low noise                
              and it has been suggested that these devices may be quite useful               
              as scintillation photodectors.
