Abstract    :
                   This research will investigate innovative technologies for the            
              retail-apparel-textile industries.  These are: (1) a                           
              three-dimensional/four-dimensional (maps and animation) computer               
              program for guiding production workers in building quality,                    
              one-of-a-kind products, at a low-cost; (2) an integrated Computer              
              Aided Design/Computer Aided Manufacturing program in which every               
              human resource becomes a part of the whole industrial                          
              complex; (3) a database program for assessing, sorting, and                    
              matching every worker's skills.                                                
                   The model-maker will create the processes for the makers in               
              the factory.  Other Computer Aided Design/Computer Aided                       
              Manufacturing vendors can utilize the interface processes, that are            
              being researched, to enhance their systems and make technology more            
              acceptable to the apparel industry.
