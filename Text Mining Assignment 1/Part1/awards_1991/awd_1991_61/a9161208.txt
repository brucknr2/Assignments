Abstract    :
              Automatic Generation Control (AGC) of power                                    
              systems has two major objectives.  The first - load                            
              tracking - requires control of total generation at the                         
              maximum permissible ramping capability.  The                                   
              second - economic - requires control of individual units                       
              to redistribute the total generation in an economical                          
              manner.  These two objectives can be in conflict and a                         
              coordinating controller is needed to assure good AGC                           
              control.                                                                       
              The design approach to achieve load tracking and                               
              generation redistribution is based on decomposing the                          
              vector formed by set points of all units into a vector                         
              sum of two components, one along the direction                                 
              defined by the ramp limits for all units and the other                         
              along the subspace defined by the summation of set                             
              points of all units equal to zero.  The control of each                        
              process is realized by varying the corresponding                               
              component.                                                                     
              A linear design is presented.  This linear design                              
              provides good control under small changes but results                          
              in an oscillatory response otherwise, due to the                               
              nonlinearity of unit ramp limits.  The elements within                         
              the linear design that need improvement for such                               
              problems are identified.
