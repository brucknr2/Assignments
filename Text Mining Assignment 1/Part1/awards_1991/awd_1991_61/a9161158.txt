Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research project is to develop hands-on integrated science                
              materials based on the phenomenon of bioluminescence.  The                     
              materials developed will aid in the observation, discovery, and                
              learning of basic concepts in various scientific fields.  The                  
              research will examine the appropriateness of bioluminescent                    
              earthworms for the use as a teaching aid in terms of the ease of               
              raising and maintenance, and methods of stimulation of the                     
              bioluminescence display.  The use would be for grades K-12.
