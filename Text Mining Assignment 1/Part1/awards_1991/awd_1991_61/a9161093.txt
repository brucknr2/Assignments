Abstract    :
                   A significant commercial opportunity lies in providing software           
              systems which take real world engineering problems, expressed in               
              engineering rather than mathematical terms, and convert these problems         
              into systems of mathematical equations.  These equations may then be           
              analyzed using the symbolic and numerical facilities of a general              
              purpose mathematical mathematics package.  This approach separates             
              application specific engineering knowledge from the application                
              independent capabilities of general purpose mathematical software.  In         
              the last four years, Variational Geometry has emerged as natural and           
              powerful language for the expression of mechanical engineering                 
              problems; particularly problems in the realm of engineering mechanics.         
              The goal of this project is to develop an engineering mechanics                
              package which will serve to convert a variational geometry based               
              description of the engineering problem into a symbolic mathematical            
              description, which may then be analyzed inside a general purpose               
              mathematical package.  The Phase I research will establish the                 
              feasiblity of taking this approach and the performance gains which may         
              be realized.
