Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 project is              
              in the general area of Computational Chemistry.  Global                        
              optimization plays a key role in molecular computations in                     
              computational chemistry.  Due to the large size of even modest                 
              molecules, these methods must contend with countless local minima.             
              Clever algorithms have been developed that sample parameter space              
              to reduce trapping in local minima, but these fail by providing                
              statistical rather than guaranteed solutions.                                  
                                                                                             
              There is a class of algorithms that for certain functions                      
              guarantee that a global minimum has been found.  These methods                 
              achieve this remarkable result using interval arithmetic.                      
              Interval global optimization has been known for some time, but has             
              never been applied to systems as large as those encountered in                 
              computational chemistry.                                                       
                                                                                             
              This project will identify how to modify the functions encountered             
              in computational chemistry such that interval global analysis                  
              applies.  It will also explore the parallel programming techniques             
              necessary to scale the calculations up to the huge sizes demanded              
              by molecular mechanics calculations.
