Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award provides support to analyze a new micromechanical                   
              structure for the precision measurement of acceleration.  The                  
              device utilizes a high Q silicon resonator incorporated into the               
              silicon hinge of a monolithic silicon accelerometer.  Resonators               
              have the potential of offering truly exceptional stability at                  
              very low cost and with only minor additional processing                        
              complexity over what is needed currently.  Resonant beam                       
              structures have been fabricated for a number of pressure sensor                
              applications to demonstrate experimental feasibility.  This work               
              build upon the pressure sensing technology to create a self-                   
              contained silicon accelerometer structure.
