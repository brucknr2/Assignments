Abstract    :
                 This is a Presidential Young Investigator Award.  The long-term             
              goal of Dr. Brodl's research is to understand the cell biology of              
              higher plant responses to environmental stress.  The model system              
              for investigation is the heat shock response of the aleurone layer             
              of barley grains.  The cells of this tissue are normally dedicated             
              to protein secretion; however, heat shock dramatically redirects               
              their cellular activities.  The synthesis of secretory proteins is             
              abruptly arrested when the tissue is subjected to heat shock, yet              
              the synthesis of nonsecretory proteins continues.  This is                     
              accomplished by the selective destabilization of otherwise stable              
              secretory protein mRNAs.  Heat shock also causes the loss of                   
              endoplasmic reticulum lamellar structures upon which secretory                 
              protein mRNAs are translated; only small fragments of ER remain.               
              This appears to provide the discriminatory mechanism for                       
              selectively stopping the synthesis of secretory proteins, as                   
              nonsecretory protein mRNAs are not translated by ER-bound                      
              ribosomes.  Dr. Brodl will continue and extend his studies of the              
              molecular and cellular basis for these heat shock-induced events.              
                                                                                             
              This research program should provide insights into the cell biology            
              of ER, as well as reveal mechanisms for regulating protein                     
              expression during heat shock.  These efforts will ultimately build             
              a better understanding of how plants respond and adapt to stress.
