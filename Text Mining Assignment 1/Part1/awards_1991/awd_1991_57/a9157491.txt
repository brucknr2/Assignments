Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This Presidential Young Investigator Award will be aimed at                    
              understanding the evolution of bulk physical properties from those             
              of isolated molecules, with the goal of discovering novel chemical             
              and physical properties of materials.  Materials to be investigated            
              will include pure compound semiconductor clusters, and clusters                
              doped with magnetic substitutional impurities to yield diluted                 
              magnetic semiconductor clusters.  A parallel synthetic program to              
              prepare clusters of new materials will also be implemented.
