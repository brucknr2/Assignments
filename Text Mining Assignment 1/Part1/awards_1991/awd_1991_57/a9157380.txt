Abstract    :
              This is the first year base and matching amount funding of a                   
              five-year PYI continuing award.  The PI works on design of                     
              interfaces for collaborative environments.  The current research               
              is on designs that allow one to see the layout of many other                   
              collaborator's surfaces at a glance.  This research aims to                    
              provide a recursive system of indefinitely zoomable magnifying                 
              glasses through which one can read, write, or create cross-                    
              references on an indefinitely enlargeable (zoomable) surface.  A               
              number of algorithms for dynamically displaying such information               
              in 'real time' on unenhanced bit-mapped workstations have already              
              been developed by the author.  The research will continue by                   
              defining and implementing the basic collection of functions in                 
              the interactive zoomable window system.  Then, the system will be              
              extended across a network, thereby making available a shared                   
              information space which will allow an arbitrary number of users                
              to work in a common virtual environment, each possibly enjoying a              
              different view of this environment.  The researcher will also                  
              build applications, including multiscale graphical "yellow pages"              
              and shared spreadsheet systems, to test the real benefit of the                
              implemented system.
