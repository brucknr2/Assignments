Abstract    :
              Research plans are 1. to continue theoretical investigations of the            
              mechanisms of high temperature superconductivity, with special                 
              emphasis on magnetic mechanisms and novel approaches to the physics            
              of strong coupling superconductors, and 2. to study the statistical            
              mechanics of phase transitions in quantum and driven non-                      
              equilibrium classical systems.
