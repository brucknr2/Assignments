Abstract    :
              Under this PYI award the process of laser excited chemical vapor               
              deposition will be studied and developed for rapid deposition of               
              films of diamond, born nitride and other nitrides.  The process is             
              a non-equilibrium process which relies on the number of molecular              
              collisions and therefore should scale up with pressure.  This will             
              be quantified and the dominant chemical species will be determined             
              by spectroscopic diagnostics.  Film morphology, microstructure and             
              mechanical properties will be correlated with gas phase chemistry              
              in order to optimize the process parameters.
