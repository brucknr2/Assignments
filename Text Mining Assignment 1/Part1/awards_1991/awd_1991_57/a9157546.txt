Abstract    :
                   The investigator will study computational fluid dynamics                  
              problems centering on shock wave propagation and transonic flow,               
              and also the partial differential equations that describe                      
              semiconductor devices. These equations are similar to the                      
              equations of fluid dynamics and many of the numerical techniques               
              useful in one case carry over to the other. Numerical                          
              calculations and the development of algorithms are a major part                
              of these studies.                                                              
                   Computational fluid dynamics undertakes to determine                      
              numerically the solution of the differential equations that                    
              describe the motion of a fluid, particularly in cases where the                
              solution cannot be written down explicitly.  Such difficult cases              
              are the rule for the fluid dynamics problems that arise in                     
              practice.  Applications in which shocks occur are common.                      
              Transonic flow problems arise in aerospace design. In the area of              
              semiconductors, the project work has applications in resolving                 
              several different semiconductor models and in the fabrication of               
              semiconductors.
