Abstract    :
              This grant supports basic experimental research on: (1) Coastal                
              Erosion - Investigate Wave/Sediment process in swash zone based                
              on large wave-tank experiments. (2) Environmental loading on                   
              ocean structures - investigate wave interaction with cylinders                 
              through experiments on fluid pressures near surface, interaction               
              of drag and inertia forces, and effect of wave groups on                       
              structure motions.
