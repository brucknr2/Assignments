Abstract    :
              Bresler         This research falls into four broad areas: image 
              reconstruction, reconstruction of time-varying distributions,  sensor array
              processing, and visualization of multiparameter  data. In the area of image
              processing, the principal objective is  to develop the theory and associated
              computational algorithms for  superresolution image reconstruction from partial
              and noisy data,  using statistical models. For the second area, the goal is to 
              develop optimum signal acquisition schemes subject to physical or  economic
              constraints, and the associated efficient reconstruction  algorithms, for
              imaging spatial data that is time varying during  the acquisition process. In
              the area of sensor area processing,  several issues are being addressed
              including the design of  computationally efficient algorithms for the
              (sub)optimal  solutions of model fitting problems, wideband source location, 
              and imaging with sensor arrays. Finally, in the last area, the  goal is to
              address the effective fusion, display, and  visualization of multi-parameter
              spatially-related data, such as  is acquired in multispectral, or
              multi-modality remote sensing  and diagnostic imaging.
