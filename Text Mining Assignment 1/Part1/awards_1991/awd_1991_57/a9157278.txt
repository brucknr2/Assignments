Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Thermal processing plays an important role during the manufacturing            
              of electronic and optical materials.  Several new issues are to be             
              explored, including the following:  thermally induced instabilities            
              at the solid-liquid interface of thermally processed semiconducting            
              films, microscale thermal radiation phenomena induced by the sub-              
              wavelength film thickness of multilayer structures, thermal                    
              analysis of explosive crystallization of multilayer film structures            
              such as Si-Ni, and investigation of heat transfer and fluid flow               
              phenomena associated with the manufacturing of optical fibers.                 
                                                                                             
              The quality and ease of manufacture of electronic and optical                  
              materials are often controlled by thermal processes.  This research            
              will bridge the gap in expertise between manufacturing and heat                
              transfer engineering, and will attempt to supplant the trial and               
              error methods so prominent in American industry today.
