Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              Sperm maturation and glycosidic enzymes.  The capacity of sperm to             
              effectively fertilize an overm is acquired during passage through              
              the epididymis.  Dr. Hall has developed a hypothesis that sperm are            
              "activated" by modification of surface membrane, specifically,                 
              modification of carbohydrate molecules on the cell surface.  He                
              proposes that the epididymis secretes enzymes that alter surface               
              carbohydrates.  He plans to study these enzymes and their secretion            
              in detail.  It is conceivable that this basic research could lead              
              to development of effective male contraceptives.//
