Abstract    :
              Nucleic acid biophysics and DNA-small molecule interactions                    
              will be investigated by constructing monolayer electrodes with                 
              pendant DNA intercalators such as ethidium and exposing these                  
              surfaces to aqueous solutions of nucleic acid.  The specific                   
              aims are: 1) to assemble and characterize monolayer electrodes                 
              with pendant functionalities known to bind DNA, 2) to study the                
              binding of DNA to these electrodes and the biophysics of the                   
              bound nucleic acid, 3) to study the interactions of exogenous                  
              metallointercalators with the bound DNA, and 4) to investigate                 
              the energetics of DNA cleavage by bound drugs such as                          
              bleomycin.  In a separate but related project use will be made                 
              of the diverse, new technology of polymer-modified electrodes                  
              to construct model metalloenzymes.  In these systems, the                      
              electron relay will be provided by the electrode, and the                      
              protein environment will be simulated by the polymer film.

              Dr. H. Holden Thorp of North Carolina State University is                      
              supported as a Presidential Young Investigator by the                          
              Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program.                 
              Dr. Thorp's project is in the area of bioinorganic chemistry                   
              and has the key goals of improving our understanding of the                    
              interactions of metal complexes with DNA and modeling the                      
              structure and function of redox metalloenzymes. Extensive                      
              application of recent advances in the preparation of chemically                
              modified electrodes will be made.
