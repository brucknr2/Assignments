Abstract    :
                   The investigator outlines a research plan directed                        
              towards development of high precision, solid state tracking                    
              devices which can be used to reconstruct vertices                              
              corresponding to the origin of tracks from D or B meson                        
              decays.  The kind of detector presently envisaged uses a newly                 
              emerging technology with two sided strip etchings on a silicon                 
              substrate.  More esoteric detectors are also to be developed                   
              using heterojunction techniques.  The devices so formed would                  
              have an intrinsic gain reducing the need for massive external                  
              electronics.
