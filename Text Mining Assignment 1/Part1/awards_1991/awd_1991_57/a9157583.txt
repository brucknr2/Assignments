Abstract    :
                  Pausch  9157583      This is the fourth year of a five year continuing
              grant.  This  research aims at integrating multimodal input streams from a
              human  to a computer into higher level semantic actions.  This project is 
              important because of the current imbalance of information flow  between a human
              and the computer with computer output being several  orders of magnitude
              greater than user input by gestures, voice and  other input modalities by
              examining new software architectures to  deal with probabilistic input and
              combinations of simultanewous  probabilitistic input streams.  Higher level
              semantics of  multi-modal inputs will be addressed by research on input 
              specification languages which properly incorporate time, the  sharing of
              semantic information at various levels of synthesis and  the development of a
              general framework to support the combination  of probabilistic input streams.
