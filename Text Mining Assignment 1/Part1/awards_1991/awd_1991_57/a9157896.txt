Abstract    :
              During this PYI Grant period, the primary focus of the research                
              will be on advanced control system design for autonomous underwater            
              vehicles.  A real time 3-D graphic simulator will be developed to              
              study the theoretical characteristics of the design.  A coordinated            
              adaptive control system for the vehicle and its manipulator will               
              be designed by simulation and experiment.
