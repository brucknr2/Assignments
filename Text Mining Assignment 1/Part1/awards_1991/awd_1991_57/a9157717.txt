Abstract    :
              With this Presidential Young Investigator award from the                       
              Theoretical and Computational Program of the Chemistry                         
              Division, Professor Zheng will utilize newly developed computer                
              simulation technology to study the mechanism of solid state                    
              reactions. Three issues will be addressed: (1) What is the                     
              solid structure with global minimum free energy given a certain                
              stoichiometric ratio of reactants? (2) Given a structure, what                 
              is the typical kinetic barrier in  a solid reaction from the                   
              reactants to the products? (3) What is the microscopic                         
              mechanism of a solid state reaction?  The Monte Carlo algorithm                
              or molecular dynamics method combined with a simulated                         
              annealing optimization scheme will be used to search for the                   
              global or local free energy minimum. The kinetic barrier will                  
              be computed by means of the free energy perturbation method of                 
              McCammon. The reaction activation free energy will be                          
              calculated classically, or quantum mechanically with the                       
              Feynman path integral technique.                                               
              %%%                                                                            
              In this project theoretical and computational methods will be                  
              used to predict the products of solid state reactions, the                     
              magnitudes of the barriers to such reactions and the mechanisms                
              by which these reactions occur. The results are expected to be                 
              useful in guiding the synthesis of novel materials.
