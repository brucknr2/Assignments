Abstract    :
              The PI's (S. Ruden) principal research interests lie in the physics            
              of the formation of stars and planets, particularly, in the                    
              formation of the solar system.  During the five-year tenure of his             
              PYI award, the PI will concentrate on the theoretical dynamics and             
              evolution of accretion disks around contracting proto-stars.  He               
              will also investigate the dynamics and chemistry of powerful winds             
              that flow from these young stars and which are thought to modify               
              the protostellar environment considerably.  The overall goal of                
              this program is to increase the understanding of the physical                  
              conditions and evolutionary timesales required for the formation               
              of planets around sun-like stars.
