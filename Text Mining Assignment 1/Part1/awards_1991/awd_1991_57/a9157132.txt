Abstract    :
              This is a Presidential Young Investigator Award to study the                   
              cellular basis of neurulation.  Dr. Cooper will examine the                    
              cellular dynamics involved in neural tube morphogenesis employing              
              fluorescence video and laser confocal microscopy examining how                 
              cytoplasmic-calcium dynamics, membrane turnover, and cytoskeletal              
              activity coordinate cellular movements and shape changes during                
              neurulation.
