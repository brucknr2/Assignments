Abstract    :
              The objective of this work is a fundamental understanding of                   
              materials processing operations that involve gas-surface                       
              interactions, including chemical vapor depsostion, molecualr                   
              beam epitaxy, and plasma etching.  The emphasis is on details                  
              of the reactions of gas-phase radicals or atoms with solid                     
              surfaces, and  on the interactions between coincident                          
              "radiation" (ions, photons, electrons) on the one hand and the                 
              substrate and adsorbed species on the other.  Radical-surface                  
              chemistry is very important to plasma processing, and also has                 
              a role in purely thermal processes such as CVD.  Radiation-                    
              induced chemistry is also involved in plasma processing, and                   
              has important applications in "selected area" processing.
