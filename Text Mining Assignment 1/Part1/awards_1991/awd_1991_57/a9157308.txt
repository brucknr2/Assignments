Abstract    :
              This is a Presidential Young Investigator award.  The                          
              research it supports will seek to improve                                      
              microfabrication technology and its application to the                         
              creation of novel sensors, actuators, and electronic                           
              devices.  The specific research involves the use of                            
              silicon wafer bonding technology for fusing single                             
              crystal silicon wafers.  This includes fundamental                             
              studies of bond mechanisms and bond strength, and                              
              the development of characterization tools for studying                         
              bond quality.  Research will also include applications                         
              to microsensors, microactuators, microelectronics, and                         
              packaging.
