Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              With the Presidential Young Investigator Award, Dr. Peralta, a                 
              cellular and molecular neurobiologist, will continue to unravel the            
              mechanisms by which neurotransmitters act in the brain.  He has                
              already made major advances in this field when he isolated the                 
              molecular clones encoding five related but distinct subtypes of the            
              muscarinic acetylcholine receptors.  These cholinergic receptors               
              regulate the activity of potassium, calcium and chloride ion                   
              channels involved in neurotransmission.  In addition, muscarinic               
              receptors control a variety of physiological responses involved in             
              heart rate and breathing.  Dr. Peralta is now concentrating on the             
              second messenger system regulated by each of the receptor subtypes             
              and has found that the different receptor subtypes regulated                   
              different systems.  Moreover, he is finding that the subtypes also             
              evoke differences in the kinetics and magnitude of calcium release.            
              Since calcium dependent events are critical for neurotransmitter               
              secretion, Dr. Peralta's work will have a major impact on                      
              elucidating the mechanisms that are likely to play a role in                   
              neuronal communication within the brain.
