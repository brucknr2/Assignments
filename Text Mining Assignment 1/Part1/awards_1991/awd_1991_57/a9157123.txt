Abstract    :
              The focus of the research plan is the study of earthquake sources              
              with the goal of a better understanding of the physics of strain               
              accumulation and release during the earthquake cycle.  To                      
              accomplish this the PI will develop new techniques in wave                     
              propagation and inverse theory.
