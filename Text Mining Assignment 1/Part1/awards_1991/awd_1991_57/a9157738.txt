Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This Presidential Young Investigator Award deals with research in              
              the area of solid-state polymeric materials, including the                     
              thermodynamics, kinetics, and molecular motions in phase                       
              transitions (particularly crystallization);  structure - property              
              (especially mechanical and optical) relationships; high-performance            
              polymeric fibers; films for microelectronic applications ; and                 
              computer simulations of macromolecular dynamics and transitions.
