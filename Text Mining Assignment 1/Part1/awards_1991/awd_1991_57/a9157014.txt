Abstract    :
              The focus of this project is the encapsulation of metal                        
              complexes in zeolites and molecular sieves; three applications                 
              will be stressed.  1) New zeolites and molecular sieves will be                
              synthesized by means of a recently developed procedure in which                
              the metal complexes act as templates during zeolite crystalli-                 
              zation.  2) New catalysts with potential application in                        
              catalytic cracking will be prepared by modification of rare                    
              earth zeolites with fluorine.  These catalysts are much more                   
              active in dehydration, dealkylaltion and disproportionation                    
              reactions.  3) Zeolite-based magnetic resonance imaging                        
              contrast agents will be prepared and optimized.                                
              %%%                                                                            
              Dr. Kenneth J. Balkus, Jr. of the University of Texas at Dallas                
              is supported as a Presidential Young Investigator by the                       
              Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program                  
              to study the chemistry of zeolites and molecular sieves.  These                
              materials are used in large quantities in industry as drying                   
              agents and as catalyst supports.  The new materials with                       
              encapsulated metals which will be synthesized may have                         
              application as catalysts in the petroleum industry and as                      
              magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents.
