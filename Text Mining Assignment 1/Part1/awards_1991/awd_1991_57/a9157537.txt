Abstract    :
              This Presidential Young Investigator will apply the first                      
              principles calculational techniques to the study of the fundamental            
              physical properties of materials.  Two new approaches are being                
              developed:  one for the calculation of the full phonon aspects and             
              the other for the surface calculations.  In addition, the study  of            
              the metal-hydrogen systems has stated.
