Abstract    :
              This Presidential Young Investigator grant involves the study of               
              complex fluids and mesoscopic systems.  In particular research will            
              be conducted in three general areas.  First, on equilibrium and                
              nonequilibrium properties of crystalline liquids, studies will be              
              made on the role of fluctuations in the vicinity of flow-induced               
              non-equilibrium critical points; on the spectrum and properties of             
              interfacial excitations; and on the effects of fluctuations in thin            
              films of pre-nematic fluids.  Second, in the area of novel quantum             
              effects in mesoscopic systems, studies will be made on                         
              geometrically-induced persistent currents in metallic rings and                
              extensions to quantized fields including photon and phonon                     
              currents.  Finally, Josephson effects in discs and other topologies            
              will be studied.                                                               
              %%%                                                                            
              This Presidential Young Investigator award will involve research on            
              topics of current interest in condensed matter physics.  Studies               
              will be made of the properties of liquid crystals - a state of                 
              matter intermediate between a solid and a liquid.  In particular,              
              the effects of fluctuations on the properties of the liquid crystal            
              as it changes from one phase to another will be studied.  Research             
              will also be conducted in the area of mesoscopic physics which is              
              a region intermediate between those in which quantum mechanics                 
              applies and in which classical physics applies.  This is a region              
              which is becoming accessible as devices become smaller.
