Abstract    :
                   The general focus of this research is on the development of               
              numeric methods for engineering simulation and design.  Emphasis               
              is placed on the analysis of ill-posed inverse and design problems             
              arising in solidification processing and non-destructive testing               
              of materials, optimum metal forming processes, and thermomechanical            
              modeling of solidifying bodies.                                                
                   Successful algorithmic development will result in quantum                 
              improvements in engineering design computations.
