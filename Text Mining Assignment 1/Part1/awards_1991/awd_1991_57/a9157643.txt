Abstract    :
              This award funds the first year of a five-year Presidential Young              
              Investigator Award for research into an understanding of the                   
              information requirements of manipulation tasks.  The aim is to                 
              develop a high-level representation of tasks that facilitates the              
              decomposition into subtasks and the translation of high-level                  
              specifications into low-level robot commands.  Such translation                
              is complicated by uncertainties which may propagate through the                
              system.  A manipulation language will be developed to support                  
              task decomposition and abstraction, and several types of                       
              manipulation tasks will be studied, including parts orienting,                 
              assembly by implosion, and large-scale mounting operations.  The               
              project will study information flow among the decomposed                       
              subtasks.  This research should lead to a better understanding of              
              the fundamentals of manipulation, a better characterization of                 
              the relations among information, speed of assemble, and task                   
              solvability, and a better understanding of how to design robots                
              for operation in a world with uncertainties.//
