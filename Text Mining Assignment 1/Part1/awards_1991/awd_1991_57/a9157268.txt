Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Two complementary studies will be undertaken in evolutionary                   
              physiology. The ultimate goal is to elucidate the bases for                    
              differences in organismal performance that may exist among                     
              individuals and species, and to understand how and how rapidly                 
              capacities for physiological performance may be modified through               
              artificial or natural selection (organic evolution). First,                    
              artificial selection experiments with mice will test what                      
              proximate physiological and biochemical factors are limiting to                
              the evolution of increased capacities for locomotor performance.               
                                                                                             
              At present, cross species comparative data cannot be properly                  
              analyzed with standard statistical tests, because species are                  
              descended from common ancestors in a hierarchical fashion, and so              
              are neither biologically not statistically independent. A second               
              research thrust will involve using computer simulation techniques              
              to develop and compare alternative statistical methods to correct              
              for phylogenetic non-independence and so provide  valid                        
              significance tests and parameter estimates for comparative                     
              (interspecific) data.
