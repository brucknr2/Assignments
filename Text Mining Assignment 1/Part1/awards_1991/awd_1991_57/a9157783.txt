Abstract    :
              Studies will be undertaken to understand two cell                              
              behaviors important to tissue engineering:  secretion and                      
              migration.   Understanding these behaviors is important                        
              for efficient tissue development in order to replace                           
              defective hormones and administer pharmacologic agents.                        
              Research will target mechanisms of stimulus-secretion                          
              coupling, with emphasis on the role of cell membrane                           
              electrophysiology in these mechanisms.  Engineering                            
              principals are to be applied in the experiments, and                           
              mathematical models will be used to investigate cell                           
              migration in three-dimensional biological matrices.
