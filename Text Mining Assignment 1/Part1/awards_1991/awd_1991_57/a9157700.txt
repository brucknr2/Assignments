Abstract    :
                   This Presidential Young Investigator will work on a                       
              nonlinear harmonic theory for representations of the fundamental               
              group of ordinary differential equations.  He will also work on                
              the relationship between the two algebraic structures on the                   
              space representations, in particular the behavior at infinity.                 
                   This project falls into the general area of modern                        
              geometry -a subject that blends two of the oldest areas of                     
              mathematics:  algebra and geometry.  This combination has proved               
              extraordinarily fruitful - having recently solved problems that                
              withstood generations.  Among its many application are to gauge                
              theories in physics and dynamical systems in mechanics.
