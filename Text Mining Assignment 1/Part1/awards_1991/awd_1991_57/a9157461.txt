Abstract    :
                   This Presidential Young Investigator will continue to work                
              in two areas of probability theory:  classical stochastic                      
              processes and interacting particle systems.  In addition he will               
              work on the subject of the diffusions of fractals.  This award                 
              will allow Mountford to continue collaborations in these areas                 
              and will allow him to bring visitors to the UCLA campus.
