Abstract    :
              The research addresses problems in mechanism theory, and focuses               
              on (a) kinematics, dynamics and design of closed chain                         
              mechanisms, (b) dynamic control of multiple cooperating robotic                
              systems and (c) autonomous manipulation and locomotion in                      
              unstructured environments.  The first topic is further divided                 
              into three thrust areas including (1) control of a three degree                
              of freedom pneumatic wrist ankle joint capable of sustaining                   
              impacts and accommodating constraints, (2) design of cable spring              
              transmissions, and (3) synthesis of closed loop parallel drive                 
              linkages for special purpose robots in manufacturing. The second               
              topic, coordination of multiple robots, addresses the                          
              simultaneous control of trajectory and constraint forces.                      
              Specifically, the research problems are the control of contact                 
              conditions, modeling and control of contact interactions when                  
              compliant skins are used, and experimental validation of the                   
              models and algorithms by using  a test bed comprising two arms                 
              and objects that are larger than the end effectors.  The third                 
              research topic on coordination focuses on (1) using compliant                  
              models for the locomotor terrain system to solve the force                     
              distribution and traction optimization problem, (2) developing                 
              measures of stability for locomotion on undulating terrain under               
              dynamic loading, and (3) establishing optimal foothold sequences               
              and gait control schemes for dynamically stable walking machines.
