Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              When the leaves of a plant are eaten by an herbivore, both                     
              defensive and physiological responses are observed in the                      
              remaining leaves. These responses contribute to a plant's                      
              resistance and resilience to herbivory, respectively. The                      
              metabolic integration of these responses has gone largely                      
              unexplored and will be examined in a species where leaf damage                 
              results in large (4-fold) increases in leaf alkaloids and large                
              (2-fold) increases in the photosynthetic capacity. Specifically,               
              the metabolic integration of the nitrogen-intensive responses to               
              herbivory will be investigated using 15N and 14C-labeled alkaloid              
              to follow the movement of nitrogen and carbon between root and                 
              shoot and between alkaloid and protein metabolism. The movement                
              of nitrogen from alkaloid to leaf photosynthetic proteins will be              
              correlated with changes in the photosynthetic capacity of leaves               
              after damage. Examining chemical defenses as an integral part of               
              the physiological processes by which plants regrow those tissues               
              lost to herbivores, will strengthen our understanding of the                   
              evolution of chemical defenses in plants.
