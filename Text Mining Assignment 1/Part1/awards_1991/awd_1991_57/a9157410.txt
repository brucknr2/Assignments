Abstract    :
                   This Presidential Young Investigator award will support the               
              research of Professor Wodzicki in the area of noncommutative                   
              differential geometry.  The dominant themes in this research will              
              be a noncommutative Riemann-Roch theorem, higher index                         
              invariants, connections with arithmetic algebraic geometry via                 
              noncommutative differential geometry in positive characteristic,               
              and quantization of homological algebras in a direction parallel               
              to quantum groups.                                                             
                   Differential geometry can be thought of as calculus on                    
              manifolds.  These are surfaces and their higher dimensional                    
              analogues.  The algebra of differentiation operators on the                    
              manifold can be further abstracted until there is no manifold                  
              left but just the algebra.  This is the far reaching                           
              generalization of differential geometry called noncommutative                  
              differential geometry.  The area draws on and nourishes all the                
              major fields of mathematics:  algebra, geometry and analysis.
