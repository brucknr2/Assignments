Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Dr. Djorgovski will use this Presidential Young Investigator Award             
              to pursue several lines of inquiry within observational cosmology              
              and extragalactic astronomy.  This work will focus on the formation            
              and evolution of galaxies and upon physical understanding of their             
              global properties.
