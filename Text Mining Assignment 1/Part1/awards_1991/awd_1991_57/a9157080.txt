Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              PI plans to continue his work related to damage control and                    
              sensing, active vibration control and structural design                        
              methodologies for material systems and structures with                         
              complex embedded arrays of sensors, actuators and control                      
              networks.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              The focus of his research program to date has been in                          
              developing new material systems (intelligent material                          
              systems), characterising and modeling these new material                       
              systems and implementing these innovations into active                         
              control applications.  The development and subsequent                          
              production of this new class of materials could have impact                    
              on several diverse technological fields, i.e., material                        
              science, design and health monitoring of civil engineering                     
              structures, control of large flexible structures, ocean and                    
              aerospace structures, structural acoustics, and robotics,                      
              and may act as a catalyst for the development of many new                      
              devices and technologies.
