Abstract    :
                 Professor Dor Ben-Amotz is supported by a grant from the                    
              Experimental Physical Chemistry Program for studies of the                     
              behavior of molecules in complex fluid materials.  The goal of                 
              these studies is to gain an understanding of the structure and                 
              dynamics in these systems at the microscopic level.  The                       
              research is in three parts: (1) Raman and time-resolved                        
              fluorescence/phosphorescence depolarization studies of the                     
              changes in the vibration and rotation of molecules under                       
              turbulent flow, (2)  studies of surface-adsorbed molecules at                  
              solid-liquid interfaces at high pressures by the same                          
              techniques, and (3) development of molecular probes for in situ                
              optical measurements of temperature, pressure, viscosity in                    
              inhomogeneous fluids.                                                          
              %%%                                                                            
              The key questions to be adressed in the research supported by                  
              this Presidential Young Investigator Award are: To what extent                 
              do turbulent structures persist at the molecular scale? Is the                 
              distribution of local solvent cage densities significantly                     
              affected by turbulent flow?  An understanding of fluid behavior                
              under turbulent flow has important implications in lubrication                 
              and drag reduction technologies.  Raman spectroscopy will be                   
              used to fingerprint chemical changes on surfaces of fluids in                  
              contact with high surface area metal powders.  A long term goal                
              is the development of new strategies for catalysis, synthesis,                 
              separation, and analysis of complex fluid materials.
