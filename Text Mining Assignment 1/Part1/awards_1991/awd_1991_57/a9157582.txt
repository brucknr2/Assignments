Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The proposed research focuses on a multidisciplinary approach                  
              toward computation of macromolecular structure.  The aim is to                 
              (1) develop new algorithms for multivariate minimization and                   
              molecular dynamics on supercomputers, and (2) apply them to                    
              outstanding problems in nucleic acid and protein dynamics.  A key              
              vehicle is the Langevin/Implicit-Euler scheme for molecular                    
              dynamics, permitting large time steps and damping high-frequency               
              modes.  Efficient conformational searches and global optimization              
              strategies will be applied to important folding problems in DNA                
              and proteins.
