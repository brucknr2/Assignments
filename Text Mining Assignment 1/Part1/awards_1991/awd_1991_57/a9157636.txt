Abstract    :
              This is the first year base amount funding of a five year PYI                  
              continuing award. This work will expand on the understanding and               
              exploitation of tractable models of reasoning.  To explain how                 
              people perform so well on tasks that are theoretically                         
              intractable, we must assume that approximation methods, based on               
              tractable models, cover a significant part of intelligent                      
              activities and, hence, should serve as the cornerstone of                      
              automated reasoning systems.  This principle provides the                      
              motivation for this research.  This work will:  (1) Establish a                
              formal relational basis for connectionist models and neural                    
              networks and, using the language of constraint networks, quantify              
              the powers and limitations of these models in terms of                         
              expressiveness and computational efficiency.  (2) Establish a                  
              formal basis of causal theories using the language of relational               
              algebra and (directed) constraint networks.  (3) Identify                      
              tractable classes of logic programs, default knowledge bases and               
              temporal reasoning sub-languages, recognizable via the                         
              topological features of their specifications.  (4) Apply                       
              constraint network techniques to real life problems such as                    
              scheduling, planning and diagnosis.
