Abstract    :
              This is an award to support research the objective of                          
              which is to obtain a better understanding than now exists                      
              of the fate and transport of ionic solutes (primarily                          
              metals) in the subsurface environment, in adsorption                           
              processes for treatment of water and wastewater and in                         
              processes for treatment of contaminated soils.  Work                           
              includes determining the mechanisms of solute                                  
              precipitation on particles and the influence of humic                          
              material coatings on surface and sorptive properties of                        
              minerals.  Competitive sorption of solutes will be studied                     
              especially between trace metals and major electrolyte                          
              ions.                                                                          
                                                                                             
              This award provides initial base-level support for this                        
              Presidential Young Investigator and funds to match $37,500                     
              provided by the Chambers Development Corporation of                            
              Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  Results are expected to advance                     
              the understanding we now have of adsorption mechanisms for                     
              aqueous ionic solutes, to enhance the usefulness of                            
              existing adsorption models that are used in design of                          
              processes for treatment of water and wastewater, in                            
              predicting the movement of pollutants in aquifers, and in                      
              engineering design of systems to decontaminate soil.
