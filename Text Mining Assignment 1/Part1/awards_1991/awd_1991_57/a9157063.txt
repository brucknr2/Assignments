Abstract    :
              Supported by a grant under the Presidential Young Investigator                  
                                                                                            
              program, theoretical and modeling research will be conducted                   
              on various aspects of two phase flow.  Initial focus will be                   
              on interfacial instability in co extrusion  of immiscible                      
              viscoelastic liquids, numerical simulation of water lubricated                 
                                                                                             
              pipeline transport of heavy viscous liquids, and buckling                      
              instabilities between co flowing liquids.                                      
              The modeling will permit increased realism and accuracy in the                 
                                                                                             
              prediction of multilayer polymer processing, transport of                      
              crude oil, and other two phase engineering flow systems.
