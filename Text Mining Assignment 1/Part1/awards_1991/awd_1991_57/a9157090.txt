Abstract    :
              Research in the areas of micromechanics modelling, finite elements             
              and fracture mechanics as they relate to composite material systems            
              will be performed.  Of particular interest is the design, including            
              shape optimization, of fiber-reinforced and laminated, ceramic or              
              metal matrix structural composite components with optimum                      
              microstructure.  This approach bridges the micro- and macro-                   
              mechanical composite behavior and requires the use of both                     
              theoretical and non-linear finite element analyses.
