Abstract    :
              A combination of pulsed molecular beam, surface infrared                       
              spectroscopy, and surface optoacoustic spectroscopy will be                    
              used to investigate the kinetics of fundatmental chemical                      
              reactions on surfaces.  Adsorbate diffusion, island formation,                 
              trapping-desorption processes at deffect lattice sites, and                    
              bimolecular surface combination reactions will be amongst the                  
              processes to be investigated.  Systems to be studied include                   
              carbon monoxide and nitric oxide and some large molecular                      
              systems.  A range of single crystal substrates will be used in                 
              the study, including periodically-stepped surfaces.  The                       
              investigation will enable the mechanism for these important                    
              surface processes to be better understood.

              This five year continuing grant to the University of Maryland                  
              at College Park for support of Professor Reutt-Robey as a                      
              Presidential Young Investigator is designed to promote her                     
              rapid and effective growth as an independent researcher in the                 
              area of fundamental kinetic processes on the gas-solid                         
              interface.  The research, in the general area of Analytical and                
              Surface Chemistry, promises to provide a better understanding                  
              of surface processes which will be important for applications                  
              such as catalysis.
