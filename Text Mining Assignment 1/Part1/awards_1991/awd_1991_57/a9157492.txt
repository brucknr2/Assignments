Abstract    :
                   Shelley will work on obtaining a deeper understanding of                  
              prototypical phenomena in fluid mechanics, including study of                  
              vortex stretching and reconnection, and new numerical methods.                 
                   Fluid dynamics is an important area of research in                        
              mathematics, with applications to a wide variety of problems in                
              science and engineering.
