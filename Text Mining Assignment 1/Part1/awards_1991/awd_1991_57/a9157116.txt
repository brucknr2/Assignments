Abstract    :
              This is a Presidential Young Investigator Award.                               
              The rate at which water infiltrates waste in a landfill has                    
              a significant impact on the rate of decomposition; hence,                      
              landfill covers need to be designed to yield controlled                        
              rates of infiltration. The hydraulic behavior of covers,                       
              however, is at the present time only crudely understood. In                    
              this research, the hydraulic behavior of cover systems will                    
              be investigated and innovative technologies will be                            
              evaluated. Stochastic models will be developed to simulate                     
              the infiltration process. The stochastic models will be                        
              validated by large scale physical models tested under                          
              actual climatological conditions.
