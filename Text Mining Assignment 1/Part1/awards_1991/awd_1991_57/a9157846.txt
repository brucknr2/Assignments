Abstract    :
              A unified framework of controlled experiments, characterization,               
              and micromechanical modeling will be developed to predict the                  
              dynamic response of brittle material under stress wave loading.                
              Experimental measurements and observations will be used to                     
              understand the micromechanisms of deformation and failure and to               
              develop physically based constitutive models, including criteria               
              for nucleation and growth of damage.
