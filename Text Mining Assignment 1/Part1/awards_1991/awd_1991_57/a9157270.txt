Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The process and consequences of natural selection in wild plant                
              species will be pursued in three specific and complementary                    
              research projects. In the first, the causes and evolutionary                   
              significance of variation in life history and reproductive traits              
              within and among different populations of several sympatric wild               
              plant species in the eastern Sierra Mountains will be                          
              investigated. Another project will continue ongoing experimental               
              studies of the constancy of genetic parameter estimates                        
              (heritability and genetic correlation) in wild radish in which                 
              growing conditions will be manipulated to evaluate the rate and                
              direction of evolution under diverse environmental conditions.                 
              The third project will involve work to establish the relative                  
              importance of seed dispersal and post-dispersal events as                      
              determinants of the species distributions of economically                      
              important trees in a Peruvian rainforest.
