Abstract    :
                   The research activity will be focussed on three areas in the              
              development of robust, large-scale, flexible automation systems.               
              They are: Fidelity of Device Response, Level of Device                         
              Programmability and Data-Configurability in System Control.  To                
              achieve this end modeling and characterization of quasistatic                  
              volumetric errors in Computer Numeric Control machines will be                 
              carried out.  Also under consideration are data-configurable                   
              distributed control of flexible automated manufacturing                        
              facilities and the development of a process planning enabling                  
              platform.
