Abstract    :
              This project deals with elastic and quasielastic light scattering              
              from systems that are far from equilibrium.  One of the goals is to            
              understand better the dynamics by which systems reach equilibrium              
              states from initial, non-equilibrium conditions.  Initial work will            
              focus on binary polymer blends as they phase separate after being              
              quenched from a liquid melt state.  A factor, important in                     
              determining scattering wavelengths, is wetting phenomena, i.e., the            
              preference of one of the phases for the surface of the container.              
              The apparatus being developed for this research will have the                  
              sensitivity to probe these surface effects and thereby allow                   
              investigation of a fundamental but heretofore ignored effect.                  
              Materials preparation aspects of the project will focus on use of              
              a shear cell to elongate monodisperse droplets to yield ellipsoids             
              that can be frozen in shape by photo-crosslinking.  These                      
              ellipsoidal colloids should provide novel phases and phase                     
              transitions that have been predicted theoretically, but not yet                
              observed experimentally.
