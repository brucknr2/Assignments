Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Dr. Schepartz has organized her research to encompass three                    
              areas of concentration.   Protein affinity cleavage will be                    
              probed by the synthesis of molecules containing a protein                      
              ligand tethered to a reactive metal ion.  Current studies                      
              involve the synthesis of a synthetic peptide designed to                       
              affinity cleave the FK-506 receptor FKBP.  Affinity cleaving                   
              reagents will also be developed to give entry into the realm of                
              RNA:protein interactions.  Studies on the molecular recognition                
              of RNA will be based upon the synthesis of linked                              
              oligonucleotide probes which consist of two short DNA oligos                   
              linked by a tether of prescribed length.  The sequences of the                 
              two oligos are designed to complement unique and remote single                 
              stranded regions in the RNA.  Third, self-assembling molecules                 
              will be prepared utilizing the assembly of dimeric receptors                   
              using a mechanism of transition metal chelation.

              Dr. Alanna Schepartz of the Chemistry Department at Yale                       
              University is being supported by the Synthetic Organic Program                 
              as a Preseidential Young Investigator.  She will focus her                     
              research efforts in the area of macromolecular bioorganic                      
              chemistry.  By combining the techniques of organic chemistry                   
              and molecular biology, Dr. Schepartz will study the molecular                  
              basis of protein recognition, molecular recognition of RNA and                 
              how to turn receptors on and off.
