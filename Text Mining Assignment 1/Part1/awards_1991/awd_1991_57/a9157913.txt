Abstract    :
              Over the next five years, the Principal Investigator (PI)                      
              plans to uncover experimentally and model mathematically                       
              the regulatory interactions that control secondary                             
              metabolite synthesis, product secretion, and growth of                         
              plant cells.  The PI also plans to design recombinant                          
              organisms capable of rapid, simultaneous bioconversion of                      
              hazardous compounds into biomass, or chiral molecules for                      
              use as stereospecific feedstocks.
