Abstract    :
              This Presidential Young Investigator proposes to study a) Quantum              
              Hall effect, including Ginzburg-Landau theory of the fractional                
              effect and phase transitions between states, including effects of              
              disorder, and b) high temperature superconductors and other strong             
              correlated electron systems, through large-N and other systematic              
              methods.
