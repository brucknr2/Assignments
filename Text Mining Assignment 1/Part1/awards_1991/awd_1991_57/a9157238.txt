Abstract    :
              Research will be performed on (1) Statistical micromechanical                  
              damage mechanics: to characterize advanced brittle materials                   
              containing many interacting microcracks.  (2)  Micro-mechanics of              
              heterogeneous composites: to predict micro-macro correlation of                
              particle reinforced advanced composites.  (3)  Inelastic                       
              constitutive theories: to develop novel plasticity and visco-                  
              plasticity formulations and algorithms.  (4)  Dynamic strain                   
              softening and localization; Nonlinear frictional contact-impact                
              finite element formulations.
