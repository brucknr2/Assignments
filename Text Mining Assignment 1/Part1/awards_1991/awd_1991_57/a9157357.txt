Abstract    :
              The long-term goal of this project is to increase the performance              
              and functionality of database systems, with a special emphasis on              
              parallel database systems.  Three specific topics currently being              
              addressed are clustering/declustering of data on secondary                     
              storage, probabilistic methods in query cost estimation and query              
              evaluation, and transparent checkpointing techniques in parallel               
              persistent programming environments.  The research consists of                 
              theoretical studies to gain an understanding of the key problems               
              involved, followed by analytic studies to compare and contrast                 
              alternative solutions to these key problems, followed by                       
              prototype implementations of the most promising solutions.
