Abstract    :
                   Research in theoretical physics, to be carried out by one                 
              of the new Presidential Young Investigators for 1991, will                     
              focus on the numerical computation of physical quantities                      
              using an approximation which replaces the continuum of space-                  
              time by a discrete lattice of points.  One of the quantities                   
              to be calculated in this computer-intensive approach is the "B                 
              parameter," which describes the probability for a K particle                   
              to turn into its antiparticle.  To date, studies of the K                      
              particle are our only source of information on the asymmetry                   
              between matter and antimatter, and the interpretation of these                 
              studies depends critically on a knowledge of the B parameter.
