Abstract    :
              This research focuses on high performance operating systems for                
              uniprocessors and multiprocessors.  Architecture and programming               
              technology, the two fields which border operating systems, have                
              undergone radical changes in the last ten years.  Unfortunately, the           
              reaction of operating systems to these changes has been slight.                
              Consequently, overall system performance is growing much less quickly          
              than advances in either of these areas would lead one to predict.              
                                                                                             
              Three fundamental issues are interprocess communication, virtual               
              memory management, and distributed memory parallel programming.  The           
              goal is to bring operating systems technology into step with modern            
              architecture and modern programming systems.
