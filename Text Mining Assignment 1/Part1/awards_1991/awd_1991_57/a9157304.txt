Abstract    :
              The importance of high performance                                             
              computing to contemporary issues in                                            
              science and engineering has been                                               
              well documented.  It is the goal of                                            
              this Presidential Young Investigator                                           
              to develop efficient algorithms for                                            
              large scale computing, in                                                      
              particular, multigrid methods                                                  
              capable of solving three                                                       
              dimensional, nonlinear structural                                              
              mechanics problems.  Some of these                                             
              problems include stability of                                                  
              complex structures with both                                                   
              material and geometric                                                         
              nonlinearities.  These                                                         
              computational tools will allow the                                             
              engineers to better understand the                                             
              influence by such phenomena as mode                                            
              interaction and imperfection                                                   
              sensitivity on bucking of                                                      
              structures.  Special effort will be                                            
              made to implement these algorithms
