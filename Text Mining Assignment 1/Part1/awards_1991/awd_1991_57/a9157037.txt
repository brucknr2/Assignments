Abstract    :
                   The investigator is spokesman for experiment E800 at                      
              Fermilab.  In this experiment, it is proposed to study                         
              polarization phenomena associated with the production of                       
              strange baryons from hyperon beams.  Most theories for                         
              polarization require that the produced baryon and the target                   
              (proton in this case) contain a quark in common.  In this                      
              experiment, the produced states are Omega minus (three strange                 
              quarks) or anti-cascade minus (two anti strange quarks and an                  
              anti up quark) so that no such commonality exists.  The                        
              experiment will confirm an earlier, preliminary observation                    
              that in these cases a polarization nevertheless exists.  An                    
              even earlier observation of polarization of Lambda hyperons                    
              represents a further, fifteen year old mystery upon which                      
              light might be shed.  An additional, primary goal of the                       
              experiment is to determine the magnetic moment of the Omega                    
              minus hyperon.
