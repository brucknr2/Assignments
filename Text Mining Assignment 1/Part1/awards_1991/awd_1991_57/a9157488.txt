Abstract    :
                   Research in theoretical physics, to be carried out by one                 
              of the new Presidential Young Investigators for 1991, will                     
              include a variety of studies on quantum field theory, high-                    
              energy physics, cosmology, and quantum gravity.  Initial                       
              efforts will deal with the effects of a global charge on phase                 
              transitions in the early universe, and on conceptual                           
              difficulties relating to the quantum mechanics of the universe                 
              as a whole.  The achievement of an understanding of the early                  
              evolution of the universe and of the quantum mechanics of the                  
              universe are very important challenges to theoretical physics.
