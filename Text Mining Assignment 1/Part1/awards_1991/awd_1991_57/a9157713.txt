Abstract    :
              In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the                       
              Chemistry Division, Polik will study the chemical dynamics of                  
              highly excited molecules using molecular beam techniques and                   
              high-resolution dispersed fluorescence spectroscopy.                           
              Rovibrationally resolved dispersed fluorescence spectra of a                   
              series of aldehydes will be determined, and the implications                   
              for intramolecular energy flow will be analyzed.  The pressure                 
              dependence of dispersed fluorescence spectra will be studied to                
              show the role of dipolar interactions in intermolecular energy                 
              transfer.

              Molecular-beam and high resolution dispersed fluorescence                      
              techniques will be used to prepare and observe excited states                  
              of molecules in order to understand the microscopic details of                 
              chemical reactivity.  The results of these experiments will be                 
              used to test different models of reactive and non-reactive                     
              collision dynamics.  Dr. Polik's studies are part of the                       
              Presidential Young Investigator Award (PYI) Program.
