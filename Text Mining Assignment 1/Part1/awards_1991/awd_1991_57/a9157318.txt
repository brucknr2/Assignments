Abstract    :
              Studies will be focused on two areas.  In one area,                            
              Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) will be used to                          
              probe protein interactions in engineering (i.e.                                
              manufacturing) environments.  Protein folding,                                 
              aggregation, and conformational dynamics will be studied.                      
              In the other area, EPR measurement of free-radical                             
              reactions in supercritical fluids will provide fundamental                     
              information on supercritical fluid solvent effects.
