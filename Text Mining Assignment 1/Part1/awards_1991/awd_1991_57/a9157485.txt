Abstract    :
                   Laser based techniques for producing and manipulating ultra-              
              cold atoms are used to study basic properties of collisional                   
              interactions of ultra-cold atoms immersed in intense light                     
              fields; and to study the self-organizing properties of atoms to                
              form very small scale structures.  These new techniques are used               
              to create, and focus into 100 nm diameter spots, two ultra-cold                
              beams of sodium atoms.  These will be used in a crossed beam                   
              configuration in high vacuum to study collision cross sections at              
              very low relative velocities in a regime where conventional                    
              collision theory does not apply.  In the final two years of this               
              five year Presidential Young Investigator program, light pressure              
              forces on atoms of interest to the semiconductor industry will be              
              studied, including use of these techniques to fabricate                        
              structures on the 100nm scale with tailored transport properties.
