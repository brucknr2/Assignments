Abstract    :
              A PYI award will support research on surface degradation of brittle            
              materials as well as progression of the damage to the point of                 
              catastrophic instability.  Experimental studies and non-destructive            
              testing will be correlated with computational and theoretical                  
              research.  The results will later be extended to surface damage and            
              edge delamination problems in advanced composite materials.
