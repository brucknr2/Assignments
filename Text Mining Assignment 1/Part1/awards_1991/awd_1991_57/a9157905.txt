Abstract    :
              This is an award to support research the focus of which is                     
              on organic air pollutants, with particular emphasis on the                     
              sources, chemical reactivity, and ultimate fates of                            
              organic aerosols.  The goal of the research program to be                      
              initiated with this award by this Presidential Young                           
              Investigator is to characterize the origins and behavior                       
              of organic aerosols well enough to allow the development                       
              of accurate organic source-receptor models for use in                          
              engineering design of air pollution control processes and                      
              systems.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              This award provides initial base-level support for this                        
              Presidential Young Investigator.   Results are expected to                     
              advance the understanding we now have of chemical                              
              mechanisms that influence the fate of air pollutants                           
              associated with aerosols in outdoor and indoor air.  This                      
              in turn is expected to be applied to formulation of                            
              mathematical models that can serve as the basis for                            
              engineering design of processes and systems for dealing                        
              with this environmental threat.
