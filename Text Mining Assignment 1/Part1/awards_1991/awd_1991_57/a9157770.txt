Abstract    :
                   This project investigates new source coding techniques with               
              specific applications to high-quality digital  image compression.              
              Vector Quantization based methods for low-complexity, near-optimal             
              encoding will be studied and developed for such applications as                
              universal adaptive quantization, progressive transmission, color               
              image compression, and multi-level facsimile and graphics                      
              compression.  Special emphasis will be placed on image transmission            
              algorithms for packet network and multiprocessor environments.                 
              Parallel processing and neural network techniques will be studied              
              for time-efficient and cost effective solutions to the high                    
              complexity problem of vector quantization.
