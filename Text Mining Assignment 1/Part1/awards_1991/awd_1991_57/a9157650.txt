Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research will focus on the development of a generic,                      
              scaleable parallel computing tool for fluid dynamics.  This tool               
              will be a concrete demonstration of a broader research approach                
              to using scaleable parallel computers.  This approach is based on              
              problem structure:  defining scaleable, generic building blocks                
              and strategies for a specific application domain.
