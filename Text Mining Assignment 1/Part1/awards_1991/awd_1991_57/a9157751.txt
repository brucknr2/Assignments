Abstract    :
              The proposed research involves innovative groundbased observations             
              of Jupiter's magnetosphere and Io's extended atmosphere.  The goals            
              (1) to understand the interaction  between Jupiter's plasma and                
              Io's atmosphere, and (2) to study the causal connections between               
              Io's highly-variable volcanoes, its extended atmosphere, and the               
              plasma torus.
