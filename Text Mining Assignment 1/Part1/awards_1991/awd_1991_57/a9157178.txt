Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a Presidential Young Investigator Award to Dr. Julian                  
              Schroeder of the Biology Department at the University of                       
              California, San Diego.  Dr. Schroeder's overall research goal is               
              the elucidation of molecular mechanisms of ion transport and                   
              primary events in environmental and hormonal signal transduction               
              in higher plant cells.  His pioneering work in the application of              
              techniques of electrophysiology to plant cell biology has had a                
              major international impact.  Dr. Schroeder also shows great promise            
              as a teacher and mentor in training the next generation of                     
              scientists.
