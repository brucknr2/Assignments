Abstract    :
              This PYI award is to improve                                                   
              thebasic understanding and the                                                 
              application of optical spectroscopy                                            
              to biomedical problems.

              techniques for analyzing the                                                   
              chemical composition of tissues                                                
              noninvasively.  As a first step,                                               
              the PI will analyze the information                                            
              contained in a fluorescence

              scattering tissue.  Using imaging                                              
              techniques, methods will be

              tissue as a function of position                                               
              within the sample.  It is expected                                             
              that the proposed research will

              of tissue composition is essential.
