Abstract    :
              The goal of this research is to make predictions for the                       
              relationship among the operating variables (pressure drop, gas                 
              flux, and solid flux) in solid transfer lines.  These                          
              predictions will be generated from fundamental hydrodynamic                    
              models comprising mass, momentum, and energy balances for the                  
              two phases. Representation of fluid-fluid, particle-particle,                  
              and fluid-particle interactions will be investigated in the                    
              model development, as well as proper formulation of boundary                   
              conditions.  Computer simulation of transient two-dimensional                  
              gas-solids flow will be preformed, and the model will be                       
              extensively tested with a full range of available experimental                 
              data.                                                                          
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
              The results from lead to improved design and operation of                      
              pneumatic systems.
