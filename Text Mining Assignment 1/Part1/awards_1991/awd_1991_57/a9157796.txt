Abstract    :
              This grant is to provide research support for Dr. Brian E.                     
              Thompson under the National Science Foundation's Presidential                  
              Young Investigator Awards Program.                                             
                                                                                             
              Glow discharge (plasma) processing plays a large role in the                   
              semiconductor industry.  The overall goal of this research is                  
              to be able to operate and develop plasma processes better by                   
              having (1) increased understanding of the physical phenomena,                  
              (2) predictive simulation techniques, and (3) more                             
              easily-applied experimental diagnostics.  Studying electron                    
              and ion concentrations in plasma discharges is a major thrust                  
              of this project because these charged particles affect                         
              gas-phase reactions and surface phenomena.  The goal is to                     
              develop non-intrusive techniques to determine electron and ion                 
              concentrations and energies in industrially-used reactors.                     
              The PI also plans to model charged particles in plasmas.  One                  
              goal is to create a model that predicts electron and ion                       
              energies and concentrations in radio-frequency plasmas.  The                   
              other goal is to examine and optimize the solution techniques                  
              for the model equations.  Besides charged-particle analysis,                   
              he will examine the reactions of charge-neutral species in the                 
              discharge.  One long term goal of this modeling is finding a                   
              practical way of                                                               
              predicting creation rates of neutral species from                              
              electron-molecule collisions as a function of discharge                        
              operating parameters.  Another goal is to develop experimental                 
              techniques, especially frequency response analysis, for                        
              determining the applicable rate                                                
              constants in an operating system.  The above will be applied                   
              to the low-frequency plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition                 
              of nitrides and oxides and oxygen/nitrogen plasmas for                         
              cleaning electronic parts.
