Abstract    :
              This Presidential Young Investigator Award is aimed at the                     
              synthesis and characterization of new solid state materials with               
              interesting electrical properties, and will include a study of                 
              inorganic polymers.  Characterization will stress the relationship             
              between structure and ionic or electronic conduction, and novel                
              properties will be achieved by structural modification.
