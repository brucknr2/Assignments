Abstract    :
              Accelerometers are very useful devices but                                     
              conventional accelerometers are usually very                                   
              expensive so their use is still limited, for example, in                       
              automobiles.  Recently, bulk-micromachined silicon                             
              accelerometers have been demonstrated but they                                 
              typically have sensitivity and resolution limitation                           
              (typically no better than 1 milli-g).  A few years ago,                        
              a couple of prototype tunneling accelerometers have                            
              been demonstrated.  They do have much better                                   
              resolution but they can only be made one by one                                
              manually and tedious calibration is necessary.  In                             
              other words, bulky size, high cost, low throughput, etc.                       
              will seriously limit their application if not improved.                        
                                                                                             
              On the other hand, surface micromachining has                                  
              recently been developed to fabricate many                                      
              micromechanical devices such as pin joints, springs,                           
              sliders, cranks, gears, etc.  It is, therefore, generally                      
              believed that such technology can also be used to                              
              make microsensors.  As a result, it is proposed here                           
              that highly sensitive, low cost, small size,                                   
              accelerometers can be made combining surface                                   
              micromachining techniques and tunneling mechanism.                             
              We proposed to use surface micromachining                                      
              techniques to integrate a sharp tip, a microspring-                            
              mass, and an electrostatical feedback together to                              
              function as a tunneling accelerometer.  Such an                                
              accelerometer is estimated to have a resolution of                             
              better than 1 micro-g, which is very competitive with                          
              state-of-the-art accelerometers.  Such integrated                              
              tunneling accelerometer will have very important                               
              applications for automobile subsystems such as                                 
              airbag, autosuspension, and navigation.
