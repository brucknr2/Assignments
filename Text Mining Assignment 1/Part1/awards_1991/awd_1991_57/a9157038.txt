Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Dr. Terndrup will use this Presidential Young Investigator Award               
              to support his research on the inner bulge, halo, and disk of our              
              Galaxy.  Stellar abundances and kinematics will be measured to                 
              determine the mass distribution of the inner Galaxy and to                     
              constrain models of the formation of our Galaxy.                               
                                                                                             
              The structure and stellar population of the nuclear bulge of our               
              Galaxy have been subjects of great interest in the last ten years.             
              Many basic questions, however, are yet unanswered:  How do the                 
              bulge and the disk of the Galaxy interact?  Do the bulge and halo              
              have a separate history, or can they be understood as different                
              manifestations of the same old stellar population?  What was the               
              order of formation of the bulge, disk, and halo, and what were the             
              large-scale processes that led to the current structure of the                 
              Milky Way?  What is the relative importance of thermal versus                  
              rotational support in the bulge, and are there signs of bars or                
              other bulk motions?  Dr. Terndrup's research will address these                
              questions with an extensive observational survey of the kinematics             
              and abundances of stars in the Galactic bulge.
