Abstract    :
              With a grant under the Presidential Young Investigator                         
              Program, research on flow - structure interaction will be                      
              carried out.  Analytical modeling and computational techniques                 
              will be applied to unsteady aerodynamics and flutter in                        
              turbomachinery, transonic buffeting, and other relevant                        
              unsteady interactions between flow and flexible structures.                    
              This research will advance the ability to predict and control                  
              flutter and other instabilities in various engineering                         
              systems, primarily turbomachinery.
