Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              Five specific aims to investigate the molecular control of meiotic             
              initiation in cattle will be pursued.  SA1:  Analyze proteins                  
              produced by oocytes matured in the presence or absence of                      
              transcriptional inhibition.  SA2:  Identify cDNAs for gene products            
              required for initiation of meiosis.  SA3:  Idenfify bovine CDC2 -              
              & cyclin - like  cDNAs.  SA4:  Analyze expression of CDC2 - and                
              cyclin -like mRNAs during oogenesis and meiotic maturation.  SA5:              
              Analyze bovine CDC2 - & cyclin - like genes by southern                        
              hybridization.  These studies will provide novel research data on              
              cell proliferation supporting animal biotech industries.
