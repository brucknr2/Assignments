Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This Presidential Young Investigator Award will allow Prof. John               
              Tooby to expand his seminal work in the area of "evolutionary                  
              psychology;" an integration of evolutionary biology, anthropology              
              and cognitive psychology.  To date his work has led to a deeper                
              understanding of the evolution of the genome, the evolution of                 
              sexual reproduction and insights into the evolution of hominid                 
              behavior.  In his most recent writings, Tooby makes the case that              
              one must first understand the psychological mechanisms that                    
              underlie cultural practices, their generation and transmission,                
              before one can understand the practices themselves. The wide                   
              breadth of his pursuits indicates his encyclopedic knowledge of                
              what had been disparate fields.  Because evolutionary psychology is            
              currently forming through the integration of other intellectual                
              endeavors, there are few opportunities for funding; the PYI will               
              foster the maturation of both the individual and the paradigms of              
              the field.  This is turn may lead to the development of new                    
              fieldwork techniques.
