Abstract    :
              This award funds the first year base amount of a five-year                     
              Presidential Young Investigator Award.  The research aims to                   
              develop algorithms for image manipulation, including new                       
              techniques for image reconstruction, antialiasing, and                         
              generalized image warping.  This investigation is developing and               
              evaluating new nonlinear algorithms for image reconstruction                   
              which are efficient, amenable to hardware implementation, and                  
              superior to popular techniques of equivalent cost.  Such                       
              algorithms play an important role in warping systems.  The                     
              research also investigates the role of image warping in                        
              scientific visualization, and examines the consequences of                     
              separable image warping for elastic matching in object
