Abstract    :
              This is the first year base amount funding of a five year PYI                  
              continuing award. The focus of this work is to increase the                    
              efficacy of communication with computer through natural language               
              and other media. In particular, three central problems confront                
              researchers; robustness, fluency, and modularity.  These issues                
              can be addressed through the use of systems of constraints as the              
              underlying method for encoding the structures of natural                       
              language.  The results of investigations of these issues will be               
              tested through the implementation of prototype systems.
