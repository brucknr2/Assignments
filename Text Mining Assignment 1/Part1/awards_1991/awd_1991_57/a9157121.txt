Abstract    :
              The proposed research involves the development of a high spectral              
              resolution optical interferometer for measurement of the dynamics              
              of the Jovian magneto-nebula, the latitudinal distribution of CO               
              on Mars, and the dynamics of Mercurian sodium escape.  The                     
              instrument is designed for transportability and adaptability to a              
              wide range of emerging solar system targets of opportunity.
