Abstract    :
              III-V heterostructure device research for future                               
              advanced communications systems is proposed.  A                                
              two-prong strategy will be pursued.  Evolutionary                              
              devices with sufficiently well established operating                           
              principles on InP are targeted.  Considerable                                  
              technological work is needed before the outstanding                            
              electronic properties of InP-based semiconductors is                           
              correctly exploited.  Our strategy relies on bandgap                           
              engineering, careful introduction of strain, and                               
              monolayer epitaxial growth.  Revolutionary devices                             
              will also be investigated with the goal of synthesizing                        
              an entirely new class of "smarter" electronic devices                          
              with enhanced functionality.  To this aim, we are                              
              studying quantum effects in reduced dimensionality                             
              heterostructures.  Our guiding principle is the strong                         
              analogy between photons in guided-wave optics and                              
              electrons in one-dimensional (1D) quantized                                    
              structures.  Our technological effort will be centered                         
              around the fabrication of ballistic quantum wires and                          
              coupled quantum wires which are a test-bed for                                 
              studying new electron interactions in constricted                              
              geometries.
