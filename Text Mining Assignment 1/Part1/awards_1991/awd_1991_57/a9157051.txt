Abstract    :
              This award is the first year base funding of a five year                       
              Presidential Young Investigator Award.  The research addresses                 
              destrous manipulation with tactile sensor-equipped multifinger                 
              robot hands, micromanipulation with millimeter-sized cooperating               
              mobile modules, and understanding of nonlinear dynamics to                     
              control an acrobatic robot.  The goal of these robotic systems is              
              to manipulate and explore environments that are currently                      
              inaccessible due to size, distance, or cost.//
