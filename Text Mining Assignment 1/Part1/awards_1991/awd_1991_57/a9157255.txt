Abstract    :
              The proposed research is directed toward a structural                          
              analysis of the protein-protein interactions underlying gene                   
              regulation in prokaryotes.  Genetic and biochemical                            
              approaches will be employed to examine (i) the mechanism of                    
              transcriptional activation by phage lambda repressor and the                   
              E. coli CAP protein and (ii) the nature of interactions                        
              between regulator bound some distance from one another along                   
              the DNA.
