Abstract    :
              Theoretical and experimental studies of heat transfer                          
              phenomena will be performed involving complicated microscopic                  
              interfaces related to (1) the contact resistance problem and                   
              (2) solidification front evolution.  The challenge results                     
              from there being no separation of scale between the micro-                     
              level and the averaging level, and the failure of microscopic                  
              measurement techniques in the presence of delicate                             
              microstructures.  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will be                     
              used for non-invasive microscopy, concentration and velocity                   
              measurements close to the solidification front, with a goal of                 
              achieving one micrometer spatial resolution and velocities                     
              down to 0.1 mm/s.  For the contact resistance problem, an                      
              analytical model based upon a random distribution of finite                    
              area contact spots will be developed.  MRI will also be used                   
              in this problem to identify the appropriate geometric                          
              parameters at the interface.                                                   
                                                                                             
              Heat transfer problems of significance to the development of                   
              miniaturized microelectronic components, to advanced materials                 
              for the aerospace and biomedical industries, and to the                        
              further understanding of the solidification of binary alloys                   
              in metal casting will all be tackled by a unique application                   
              of MRI technology.  This technique will reveal new information                 
              previously unobtainable at the micrometer level.
