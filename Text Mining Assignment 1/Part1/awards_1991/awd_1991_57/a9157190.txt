Abstract    :
              For optical emitters, the vertical-cavity surface-                             
              emitting laser has recently attracted much attention                           
              because of such considerations.  The vertical-cavity                           
              structure may represent a geometry which allows for                            
              the ultimate miniaturization of the semiconductor                              
              laser.  Analogous to the quantum size effects which                            
              influence charge carriers in semiconductors, the small                         
              optical cavity of the vertical-cavity laser (on the order                      
              of the optical wavelength) can be expected to                                  
              influence the cavity confined photon emitted by the                            
              semiconductor.  In this proposed research program,                             
              these cavity confined photon-semiconductor                                     
              interactions will be experimentally investigated, with                         
              an emphasis on gleaning knowledge useful both for                              
              practical device design and also a more fundamental                            
              understanding of the semiconductor light emission                              
              process in micro-cavity structures.  The cavity                                
              structures will be realized using molecular beam                               
              epitaxy to fabricate highly reflecting A1As/GaAs                               
              Bragg mirrors for Fabry-Perot cavities.  High contrast                         
              dielectric mirrors deposited using electronbeam                                
              evaporation will also be studied.  Characterization                            
              will focus on measuring the degree of cavity enhanced                          
              or inhibited spontaneous emission with various                                 
              microcavity designs.  Results of the studies will be                           
              used to fabricate improved microcavity (vertical-                              
              cavity) semiconductor lasers.
