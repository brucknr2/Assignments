Abstract    :
              This is the first year base amount funding of a five year PYI                  
              continuing award.  On-line intelligent systems (natural or                     
              artificial) must respond to real-time constraints, synchronize                 
              themselves with their environments, and be capable of adapting                 
              their behavior continuously to dynamic environments.                           
              Furthermore, adaptive mechanisms must play a central role at                   
              manylevels if we are to utilize large-scale and highly complex                 
              computing environments effectively.  These statements provide                  
              thebasis for this research.  Self-adjusting data structures are a              
              simple example of how adaptive principles can be exploited within              
              a traditional computing framework.  A more radical approach uses               
              insights from nonlinear dynamics to design systems in which many               
              low-level interacting adaptive units produce a global dynamics                 
              that computers some useful function.  This latter approach is                  
              refer to in this effort as "emergent computation."  Classifier                 
              systems and other computational ecologies provide evidence that                
              such systems are feasible.  The immune system provides an                      
              excellent model of adaption operating at the local level and of                
              useful behavior (e.g. recognizing antigens) emerging at the                    
              global level and will be used as the domain of analysis for this               
              work.
