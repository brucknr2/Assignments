Abstract    :
              This grant is to provide research support for Dr. Charles B.                   
              Mullins under the National Science Foundation's Presidential                   
              Young Investigator Awards Program.                                             
              The ability to selectively modify material interfaces is                       
              important for: the surface hardening for mechanical or                         
              corrosive wear resistance, the production of thin films on                     
              semiconductors for advanced microelectonic devices, the                        
              deposition of polycrystalline and single crystalline diamond                   
              thin films for several advanced technologies, and the                          
              fabrication of advanced catalytic materials.  The focus of                     
              this research is to study in detail, using both experimental                   
              techniques and mathematical modelling, the basic mechanisms,                   
              kinetics and dynamics of relevant chemical reactions at                        
              material interfaces.  Concomitant with this effort,                            
              alternative (non-thermal) methods to promote chemical                          
              reactions, selectively, at interfaces will also be studied.                    
              The work will use an ultra-high vacuum scattering apparatus to                 
              investigate the influence of: (1) molecular kinetic and                        
              vibrational energy, (2) the bombardment of surface species                     
              with ions, radicals electrons and energetic neutral rare gas                   
              atoms, (3) intense electromagnetic radiation (laser and                        
              synchroton), (4) substrate heating and (5) surface and bulk                    
              additives (dopants, promoters and inhibitors) on chemical                      
              reactions relevant to thin film formation.  The initial                        
              experimental work will include studies of the surface chemical                 
              processes inherent in the formation of silicon nitride films                   
              and in the doping of silicon.
