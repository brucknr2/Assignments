Abstract    :
              This project addresses experimental validation of current                      
              analytical work in robotics as well as the initiation of new work              
              in robotics.  The principal Investigator has a strong background               
              in the mechanical aspects of robotics, including manipulator force             
              control, redundant manipulator kinematics, the analysis of                     
              dynamically stable legged locomotion, multi fingered dexterous hand            
              manipulation, and modular self organizing robotic systems.  All of             
              these topics are aimed at developing sophisticated multi degree of             
              freedom machines to enhance automation.  The applications are quite            
              broad, and encompass space exploration, medicine, and hazardous                
              waste removal.  This project will implement both a prototype hyper             
              redundant manipulation and locomotion system as well as a                      
              dynamically stable legged robotic system.  They will be used to                
              demonstrate and validate previously developed analytical models and            
              algorithms, and to identify future research needs in manipulator               
              kinematics and dynamics.
