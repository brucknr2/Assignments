Abstract    :
               The goal of this research is to develop cost-effective  computer architectures
              that take advantage of rapidly changing  technologies.  The thrust of this work
              is in memory systems,  which must supply information to increasingly-faster
              processors.  As  microprocessors approach the cycle time of supercomputers, the
              memory  system (including I/O) becomes the main difference between a personal 
              computer and a mainframe.  Current research focuses on developing new
              techniques for analyzing  memory system performance.  One new approach uses a
              renewal-theoretic  model to improve the accuracy of time-sampled trace-driven 
              simulations.  This model promises to substantially reduce simulation  time
              (10-fold) with only a small decrease in accuracy (less that 10%).  Another new
              technique is cache profiling.  Similar to traditional  execution time
              profilers, a cache profiler relates a program's cache  performance to its
              source listing.  Programmers and compiler writers  can use this information to
              optimize the cache performance of their  programs, restructuring code and
              changing algorithms.  Computer  architects use this tool to better understand
              cache access  patterns, leading to improved cache designs, synchronization 
              mechanisms, and prefetch strategies.
