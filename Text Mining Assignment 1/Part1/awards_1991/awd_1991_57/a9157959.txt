Abstract    :
              Experimentally and analytically investigate the residual strength              
              of offshore steel platform members damaged by impact, develop and              
              assess repair techniques using expansive grout.  Experimental                  
              assessment of composite (grout and steel) offshore components for              
              fatigue, ultimate strength, and response to seismic cyclic loading.            
              Develop improved numerical methods for complex stochastic and                  
              deterministic offshore platform analysis.
