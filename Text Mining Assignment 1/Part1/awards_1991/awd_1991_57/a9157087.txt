Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Supercritical fluids (SCF) have become increasingly popular,                   
              especially as extraction solvents.  Already, General Foods                     
              uses SCF carbon dioxide to extract caffeine from coffee beans                  
              and the EPA is experimenting with the use of SCF's to clean up                 
              contaminated GAC, soils and sludges.  Basic understanding of                   
              the thermodynamics of SCF's is, however, still lacking so that                 
              these important processes continue to be designed at least                     
              somewhat empirically.  The most striking contribution from my                  
              prior research is the development of a spectroscopic technique                 
              that showed greatly enriched local densities of SCF solvents                   
              around solutes when operating in the region near the critical                  
              point.  This was the first evidence of its kind to support the                 
              idea that "clustering" occurs in SCF's even when both the                      
              solvent and the solute are nonpolar.  The PI believes that                     
              this clustering and other specific chemical interactions are                   
              the main components missing in traditional equation of state                   
              models that, unfortunately, are not able to accurately predict                 
              SCF phase behavior.
