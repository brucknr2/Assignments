Abstract    :
              With support from the Organic Dynamics Program, Dr. Gellman will               
              study noncovalent interactions in organic molecules. In                        
              particular, Dr. Gellman will: (i) investigate molecular                        
              recognition of carbohydrates by synthetic receptors, (ii) perform              
              model studies on the non-covalent determinants of protein folding              
              patterns via investigation of hydrogen bonding and the hydrophobic             
              effect, (iii) pursue the synthesis of amphiphilic molecules and                
              study some aspects of their chemistry, and (iv) develop new                    
              thioether-based heavy metal ion chelators.                                     
              %%%                                                                            
              Dr. Gellman's research program seeks to elucidate the role of                  
              attractive non-bonded interactions in determining the structure                
              and function of biomolecules. A particularly important interaction             
              of this type in biomolecules is provided by hydrogen bonding. As               
              part of his overall research program, Dr. Gellman is studying the              
              effects of spatial orientation of bonding partners on overall                  
              hydrogen bond strength. In other work, Dr. Gellman is                          
              investigating a new class of molecules that can adjust their                   
              surface polarity in response to the polarity of the surrounding                
              medium. Such molecules are of potential interest as drug-delivery              
              agents.
