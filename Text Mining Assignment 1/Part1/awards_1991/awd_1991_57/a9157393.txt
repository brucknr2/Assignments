Abstract    :
              Agarwal         Parallel computers can be made both scalable and easily 
              programmable through architectures that exploit and automatically  manage
              communication locality.  The goal of this research is to  discover and to
              evaluate techniques for automatic locality  management in scalable
              multiprocessors.  As the vehicle for this  research, an experimental parallel
              machine called the Alewife is  being implemented.  Alewife employs techniques
              for:  1.     communication latency minimization, using scalable coherent 
              caches and software partitioning and placement of programs, and  2.    
              communication latency tolerance, using a new rapid-context-  switching
              processor architecture.         Alewife implements a new protocol called
              "limitless  directories" for scalable cache coherence.  This scheme uses a 
              combination of hardware and software techniques to realize the  performance of
              a full-map directory with the memory overhead of a  limited directory.  A
              rapid-context-switching processor called  Sparcle is also being designed. 
              Sparcle can switch in about 10  cycles to another thread when it suffers a
              cache miss that  requires service over the interconnection network.         The
              major goal for this grant period is to get a small  prototype Alewife system
              operational, including the hardware as  well as the entire software system.
