Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              In this study periodic multilayer thin films and their component               
              parts (single layers, bilayers, trilayers, etc.) are grown and                 
              characterized by vibrating sample and torque magnetometry,                     
              ferromagnetic resonance, transmission electron microscopy, and X-              
              ray diffraction.  The goal is to determine the interrelationships              
              between multilayer ferromagnetism, film microstructure, interfacial            
              structure and composition, and growth processes.  Model                        
              experimental systems and systematic incremental annealing                      
              treatments are used to establish direct correlations between the               
              structural and compositional evolution of the interphase interfaces            
              and the concurrently developing ferromagnetic properties.  The role            
              of crystalline anisotropy in diffusional mixing, interfacial                   
              compound formation, and interfacial magnetism is also under                    
              investigation.  Attention is being directed to nickel-based                    
              multilayer  systems with copper, aluminum, or titanium intervening             
              layers.
