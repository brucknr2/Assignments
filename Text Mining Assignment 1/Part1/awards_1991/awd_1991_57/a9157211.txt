Abstract    :
                   The objective of this research effort is to investigate the               
              integrated design of electromechanical systems with specific                   
              consideration of preventive maintenance, automated failure                     
              diagnosis, fault tolerant operation and improved serviceability.               
              The approach consists of exploiting the analytical redundancy                  
              present in models of the plant over more costly hardware redundancy            
              solutions.                                                                     
                   Potential areas of application for such a design methodology              
              which emphasizes the integration of system modelling, failure mode             
              and effects analysis, control system design, and diagnostics are               
              many, ranging from heavy industrial machinery to precision                     
              electromechanical motion control devices.  A specific application              
              of the design methodology to an electromechanical system, with its             
              hardware realization in integrated circuit form, will be                       
              considered.  Industrial collaboration will provide both the testbed            
              for the prototype development segment of this research effort.
