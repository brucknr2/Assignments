Abstract    :
              As a PYI awardee, Dr. Humphrey will                                            
              quantitate the mechanical                                                      
              characteristics of blood vessels.                                              
              The work will compare experimental                                             
              data obtained in excised blood                                                 
              vessels with those predicted by a                                              
              mathematical analysis of the vessel                                            
              mechanics.  The research will lead                                             
              to a better understanding of the                                               
              mechanical characteristics of                                                  
              living tissues, and should                                                     
              eventually lead to the development                                             
              of better tissue substitutes.
