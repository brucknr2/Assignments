Abstract    :
                   One interesting area of research in theoretical physics                   
              is the theory of superstrings.  Its main premise is simple:                    
              the nature's most fundamental constituents are not point-like                  
              particles, but tiny vibrating strings.  If this theory is                      
              successful, it may provide a unified quantum mechanical theory                 
              of all the know types of matter and forces.  The theory is so                  
              complex that we are still a long way from its detailed                         
              understanding, but there are many encouraging signs.  In the                   
              coming years Dr. Klebanov is planning to continue his effort                   
              aimed at understanding high energy physics and the quantum                     
              theory of gravity.
