Abstract    :
                   Research in theoretical physics, to be carried out by one                 
              of the new Presidential Young Investigators for 1991, will                     
              deal with various topics in string theory.  One of these                       
              topics is the problem of providing a full classical                            
              definition, and eventually a quantum-mechanical definition, of                 
              the theory.  A second topic is the further development of                      
              matrix model ideas for string theory.  String theory is a                      
              promising candidate for a theory of all the basic forces and                   
              all the elementary particles, so its further elucidation is                    
              quite important.
