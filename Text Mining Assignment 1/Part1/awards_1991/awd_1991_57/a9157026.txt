Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This Presidential Young Investigator award deals with research                 
              directed toward the synthesis and characterization of advanced                 
              polymeric materials.  Among the topics to be investigated are the              
              synthesis of a new class of photodoped conducting polymers, of                 
              inorganic-organic composites, and of transition-metal catalysts for            
              the living polymerization of monomers.
