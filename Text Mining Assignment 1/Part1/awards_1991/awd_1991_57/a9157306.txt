Abstract    :
              The research objective is to provide a theoretical                             
              foundation for designing feedback controllers for                              
              systems with uncertainty, that combines both system                            
              identification and robust control in a consistent                              
              manner and capture their fundamental limitations                               
              and capabilities.  The research in system                                      
              identification is motivated by the following question:                         
              How much information about a plant is needed to                                
              control it, and what is the minimum prior knowledge                            
              required for identifiability, all within an uncertain                          
              environment?  The theoretical work will be                                     
              complemented by adding experimental research that                              
              will both test and generate new understanding of                               
              robust control systems.
