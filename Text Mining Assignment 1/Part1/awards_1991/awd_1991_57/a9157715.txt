Abstract    :
                   This Presidential Young Investigator will focus her research              
              on a number of outstanding statistical problems in medicine and                
              biology.  Specific areas of research will be the design and                    
              analysis of sequential experiments and quantitative human                      
              genetics.  The research will help narrow the gaps between theory               
              and practice in these areas by developing increasingly functional              
              statistical models.  A major feature of the research is the                    
              commingling of advanced computational methodology and classical                
              statistics.  This award will help Hardwick strengthen existing                 
              relationships with scientists outside the field of statistics and              
              help build new relationships.
