Abstract    :
                   Research in theoretical physics, to be carried out by one                 
              of the new Presidential Young Investigators for 1991, will                     
              include studies in quantum field theory, elementary particle                   
              theory, string theory, and quantum gravity.  The research in                   
              quantum gravity will focus initially on two-dimensional                        
              gravity, which hopefully serves as a simple model of gravity                   
              in the real four-dimensional world.  The achievement of an                     
              understanding of gravity is one of the outstanding problems in                 
              physics.  String theory may help to solve this problem and at                  
              the same time to achieve a unified description of all the                      
              forces of nature.
