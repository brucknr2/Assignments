Abstract    :
              With this grant in the Theoretical and Computational Program of                
              the Chemistry Division, Professor Webster will calculate the                   
              dynamics and reactions of isolated molecules and perform                       
              simulations of solvation and vibrational relaxation in                         
              molecular liquids. A newly developed quantum molecular dynamics                
              algorithm for the real-time simulation of quantum dynamics in                  
              condensed matter will be used to model the transient bleach                    
              recovery of the absorption of excess electrons in molecular                    
              liquids. The techniques will be extended to many-body quantum                  
              dynamics in order to accurately describe vibrational relaxation                
              and vibration-rotation and vibration-vibration energy transfer                 
              in neat liquids and in mixtures. Environmental perturbations on                
              electronic structure will be incorporated into the quantum                     
              molecular dynamics algorithm either through parameterization of                
              environmental effects or through electronic calculations                       
              performed in parallel with dynamics runs. This hybrid scheme                   
              will describe the dynamics responsible for electronic                          
              relaxation, electronic dephasing and line widths, and the                      
              chemistry of radicals and open shell species in solution.

              This Presidential Young Investigator award will support the                    
              research of Dr. Frank J. O. Webster in the area of molecular                   
              dynamics. These simulations of molecular dynamics in solutions                 
              will lead to a better understanding of chemical reactions,                     
              nonlinear transport, and photoselective chemistry in solution.
