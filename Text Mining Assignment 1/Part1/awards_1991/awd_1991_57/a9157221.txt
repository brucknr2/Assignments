Abstract    :
              Stonick         This research addresses the use of numerical optimization 
              methods to develop real-time adaptive filters for estimating,  identifying, or
              predicting time-varying and potentially nonlinear  processes.  The first phase
              of this work will be devoted to the  development, analysis, and simulation of
              an optimal adaptive  infinite-impulse response (IIA) filtering algorithm for 
              telecommunications using homotopy continuation methods to perform  the
              necessary nonlinear optimization.  This research will  increase our
              understanding of IIA filter structures in time-  varying environments, and will
              ultimately lead to their more  widespread use.
