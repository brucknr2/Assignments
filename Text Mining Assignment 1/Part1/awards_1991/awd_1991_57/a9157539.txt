Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                The research plans center on the following projects:                        
              1)  Numerical studies and low-temperature electrical measurements              
              of "confined" phonon dynamics in semiconductor quantum-well                    
              structures.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              2)  Experimental and theoretical work on the dynamical and pattern-            
              forming properties of solitary space-charge waves in bulk extrinsic            
              semiconductors (p-Ge and n-GaAs).                                              
                                                                                             
              3)  Experimental studies of quantum-chaos effects in irregular                 
              optical fibers using laser and image-processing techniques.
