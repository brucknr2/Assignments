Abstract    :
              This is an award to support research the objective of                          
              which is to obtain a better understanding than now exists                      
              of the effect that airborne particles have on regional                         
              visibility and climate.  Data from laboratory experiments                      
              and field measurements by this Presidential Young                              
              Investigator will be used to validate existing radiative                       
              transfer computer models that have been developed to                           
              predict the effects that aerosols have on transfer of                          
              light through the earth's atmosphere.                                          
                                                                                             
              Results of this research are likely to be applied in                           
              improvement of existing and formulation of new computer                        
              models for use in designing air pollution control                              
              strategies.  The results are also expected to assist in                        
              elucidating the role that aerosols play in global warming.
