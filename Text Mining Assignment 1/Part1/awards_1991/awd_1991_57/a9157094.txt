Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The proposed research focuses on the use of laser-based diagnostic             
              techniques for studying spray dynamics and mixing in internal                  
              combustion engines.  The state-of-the-art of laser diffraction                 
              particle sizing and phase/doppler particle anemometry for liquid               
              phase characterization and infrared spectroscopy for fuel vapor                
              measurements will be advanced in this study.  The goals of the                 
              research include development of guidelines on manufacturing                    
              tolerances and design changes to optimize injection strategies for             
              enhanced performance and improved emission control, detailed data              
              required to verify engine combustion models, and the correlation               
              of detailed spray characteristics to engine-out emissions.                     
                                                                                             
              This work will involve detailed in-cylinder studies of emission                
              formation mechanisms from fuel injector sprays, many of which are              
              poorly understood, and will begin to help in designing combustion              
              engines for emission control.
