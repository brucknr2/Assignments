Abstract    :
              This is a Presidential Young Investigator award.                               
              The PI's research will be focused on establishing a                            
              theoretical basis for studying the phenomenon of                               
              voltage collapse in electric power systems.  The                               
              expected outcome of this research will be to develop                           
              methods for predicting the proximity of the system                             
              operating point to the voltage stability boundary and to                       
              determine corrective action to avoid voltage collapse.
