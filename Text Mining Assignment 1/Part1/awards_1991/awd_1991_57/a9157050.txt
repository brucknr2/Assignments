Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The researcher will investigate the micro and macro                            
              properties of construction materials to improve performance                    
              and environmental durability. Such materials include                           
              oxynitride glass fiber cement composites, asphaltic                            
              concrete with emphasis on low temperature susceptibility,                      
              and cement based hazardous waste stablilization  to                            
              investigate the feasibility and utilization of NDE                             
              techniques for materials and structures, i.e. optical                          
              fibers and remote imagery.
