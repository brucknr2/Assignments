Abstract    :
              The sphere of research includes the development of accurate                    
              continuum methods for vibration and stability of prestressed skewed            
              and twisted bodies.  Three areas of structural mechanics are                   
              examined, which include: (1) the effect of corner stress                       
              singularities on the vibration and buckling of sectorial and skewed            
              quadrilateral planforms of general shapes, (2) the vibration and               
              buckling of skewed and twisted 3.D bodies having mixed combinations            
              of clamped and free edge conditions, and (3) the vibration of                  
              skewed by path.dependent centrifugal body forces.  //
