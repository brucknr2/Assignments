Abstract    :
              This award allows the investigator to pursue her research spanning             
              the areas of interpersonal conflict, decision making, groups and               
              social memory.  She combines central ideas from cognitive                      
              psychology and social cognition into the study of interpersonal                
              conflict to create a new perspective in conflict research.  In her             
              work, Dr. Thompson addresses why negotiators often enter disputes              
              assuming:                                                                      
              (1) the payoffs to different parties are zero-sum, and                         
              (2) that the other party's interests are incompatible with their               
                  own.                                                                       
              Wrongly assuming that the sum of all the gains plus all the losses             
              is zero, negotiators can end up with sub-optimal outcomes.  This               
              award will support Dr.Thompson in carrying out laboratory studies              
              on negotiation behavior, and community-based research to establish             
              the external validity of laboratory research findings and to                   
              explore methods for producing more effective conflict resolution               
              in real social groups.  Dr. Thompson's work has been and will                  
              continue to be very effective in developing theory and insights                
              for the pervasive and important problem of improving interpersonal             
              conflict resolution.
