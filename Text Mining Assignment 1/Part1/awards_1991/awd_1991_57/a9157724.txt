Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project is funded by a Presidential Young Investigator award,             
              and involves fundamental research studies of the mechanism and                 
              kinetic behavior of oxygen diffusion from thin film encapsulants               
              into gallium arsenide.  The effect of substrate dopant                         
              concentration and the behavior of buried impurity profiles and                 
              defect structures exposed to surface oxidation will also be                    
              considered.  Matching funds from industry, when secured by the                 
              principal investigator, will be applied to a related study of                  
              spatially resolved current-voltent measurements of Schottky                    
              barriers using a scanning tunneling microscope.  This work on                  
              fundamental microelectronic materials issues is important for                  
              improving our general understanding of microscopic features of                 
              synthesis and processing of materials and is of vital importance to            
              the electronics industry.
