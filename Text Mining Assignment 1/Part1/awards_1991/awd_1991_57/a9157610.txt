Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research will focus on the design of parallel algorithms,                 
              languages and simulation tools that promote effective utilization              
              of parallel architectures by simplifying the task of programming               
              them efficiently.  Also, research in evolutionary software design              
              methodologies based on the use of hybrid models that include                   
              simulated and implemented system components for the design of                  
              performance-critical distributed systems will be performed.
