Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project is funded by a Presidential Young Investigator award,             
              and will focus on the development of manufacturable low temperature            
              chemical vapor deposition processes for the growth of device                   
              quality metals and compound semiconductors for use in advanced                 
              microelectronics devices and circuitry.  Matching funds from                   
              industry, when secured by the principal investigator. will be used             
              to enhance the research efforts by direct project support and                  
              through in-depth interactions between university and industrial                
              researchers.  The overall project effort is expected to contribute             
              to the scientific and technology base for improved performance and             
              reduced cost of components for telecommunications, computing and               
              information processing.
