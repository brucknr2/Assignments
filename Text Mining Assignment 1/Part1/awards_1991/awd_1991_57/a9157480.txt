              This Presidential Young Investigator Award is aimed at the                     
              synthesis and characterization of new solid state materials which              
              will include reduced ternary oxides early transition metals that               
              include titanium, niobium, and tantalum, and condensed cluster                 
              networks derived from intermetallic compounds.
