Abstract    :
                   This research will focus on understanding and modelling the               
              fundamental mechanisms governing the finite strain, multiaxial                 
              deformation of polymers.  Physically-based constitutive models                 
              developed in this research will be used in conjunction with the                
              nonlinear finite element method to enable the numerical simulation             
              of thermo-mechanically coupled deformation processing.  Simulations            
              which compute the evolution of material state with processing                  
              parameters such as straining, deformation rate and temperature can             
              be used to manufacture products with specially tailored properties             
              and to define efficient paths to achieve those properties.                     
              Furthermore, the potential of closed-loop control to further                   
              enhance processing will be investigated where current information              
              of material state (e.g. stress, strain, temperature, strength,                 
              orientation) will be used as feedback parameters to determine the              
              remaining processing path in numerical simulations.
