Abstract    :
              This program is concerned with the study of optical nonlinearities             
              in semiconductors.  The objective is to achieve stronger optical               
              nonlinearities that permit operation at lower light intensities.               
              Defect-assisted optical nonlinearities will be studied.  Prior work            
              by this principal investigator employing quantum-confined excitons             
              has pioneered in new resonant phenomena that can lead to                       
              significant enhancements of nonlinear interactions.  Semi-                     
              insulating multilayer materials for understanding the screening                
              mechanisms.  Other nonequilibrium nonlinear optical phenomena such             
              as the quenching of the photorefractive effect, optical                        
              metastability, and chaos will also be studied.
