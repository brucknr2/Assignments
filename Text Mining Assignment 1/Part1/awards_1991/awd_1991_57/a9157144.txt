Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A Presidential Young Investigator Award will support research                  
              focused on early development of the mammalian cerebral cortex.                 
              Heterochronic transplantation experiments will be performed to                 
              determine whether all cortical progenitor cells are developmentally            
              equivalent, or whether the competence of ventricular cells to                  
              respond to environmental cues changes with increasing age.                     
              Monoclonal antibodies against cell surface increasing age.                     
              Monoclonal antibodies against cell surface molecules will be raised            
              for the purpose of purifying neuronal precursors.  The                         
              developmental potential of these purified populations of precursor             
              cells will be studied in culture and following transplantation into            
              the brain in order to identify environmental factors that are                  
              involved in the production of specific, committed neuronal                     
              phenotypes.  These studies are fundamental to understanding the                
              development of brain regions involved in higher cognition.
