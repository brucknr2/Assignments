Abstract    :
                   This research is directed toward the design and analysis of               
              combinatorial algorithms.  In particular, it is concerned with                 
              strongly polynomial algorithms for combinatorial optimization                  
              problems and problems related to linear and integer programming.               
              Network, transportation, and matching  problems are being pursued.             
                   The value of results in this problem area is extremely high.
