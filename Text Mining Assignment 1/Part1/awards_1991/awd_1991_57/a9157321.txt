Abstract    :
              Studies will be undertaken to characterize the fundamental                      
                                                                                            
              interactions of mammalian cells with families of                               
              chemically homogenous polymers with the aim of developing                      
                                                                                             
              bioresorbable polymers for organ and tissue regeneration.                      
                                                                                             
              Physicochemical properties of the polymers will be                             
              systematically varied and correlated with the cell                             
              response (adhesion, growth, morphology, and gene                               
              expression) of cells in contact with the polymers.
