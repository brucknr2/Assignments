Abstract    :
              Colorimetry, central to the color-using industries, is taught                  
              at few institutions, especially as it relates to textile                       
              coloration.  Teaching requires the use of a colorimetric                       
              system, and this project helps keep the teaching of colorimetry                
              current and expand it to a wider audience.  It also allows the                 
              integration of the department's computer-aided fabric design                   
              and manufacture facility with the color measuring and producing                
              technology.  This allows the demonstration of a complete                       
              production sequence from design to final fabric.  In addition,                 
              the complete colorimetric  system affects a course, "Color",                   
              for non-science majors in that it doubles the audience for this                
              course, and makes the teaching more effective.
