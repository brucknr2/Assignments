Abstract    :
              The Department of Mathematics and Computer Science at Grambling                
              State University has recognized the changes that have already                  
              occurred as well as those that are coming as a result of the                   
              new developments in Software Engineering.  In light of this,                   
              the University has supported the development of a Software                     
              Engineering Curriculum and Laboratory.  This laboratory serves                 
              as a practicum center of Software Engineering core courses,                    
              where the curriculum is designed as per the recommendations of                 
              lEEE.  The laboratory helps Software Engineering majors                        
              graduated from this program with a thorough knowledge of the                   
              concepts as well as practical experience.  This project                        
              provides funds for the partial support of implementing the                     
              Software Engineering Lab, to purchase the IBM RlSC-6000                        
              systems, with the university and IBM jointly supported the                     
              remainder.
