Abstract    :
              The purpose of this project is to update a program in cell and                 
              molecular biology at a college that serves adult learners and                  
              a significant number of minorities and women.  Students are                    
              introduced to basic experiments in molecular biology by                        
              incorporating modern DNA technology into an existing cell                      
              biology course.  A microcentrifuge, electrophoresis chambers                   
              and shaking water bath allow students to transform E. coli with                
              p-amp and recombinant DNA, isolate DNA, perform DNA restriction                
              digests and analyze their results using electrophoresis.  These                
              experiments provide the student with 'hands-on experience' in                  
              DNA science.Instruction in cell biology is enhanced by                         
              familiarizing students with tools by which cells and their                     
              constituent components can be examined, analyzed and                           
              documented.  A phase contrast microscope allows students to                    
              examine living cells, protozoans and bacteria.  Electrophoresis                
              units for protein separation are used by students and replace                  
              demonstration laboratories.  Darkroom equipment (enlarger and                  
              ektamatic processor) give students experience in                               
              photomicrography and a visual record of their work with                        
              isolated organelles, stained chromosomes and transcriptionally                 
              active nucleoli, and cytochemical localization of                              
              carbohydrates.
