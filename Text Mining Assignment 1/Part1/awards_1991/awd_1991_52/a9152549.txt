Abstract    :
              Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) will be                         
              incorporated into the curriculum of the joint chemistry                        
              department of St. John's University and the College of St.                     
              Benedict.  The FTIR instrument will be used in the organic,                    
              advanced inorganic, physical, instrumental analysis, and                       
              nonmajor chemistry courses, as well as student research.                       
              Experiments will enhance student understanding of functional                   
              group transformations, library matching/identification of                      
              unknowns, group theory, kinetics, and rotational/vibrational                   
              spectroscopy of heteronuclear diatomic molecules.  The                         
              instrument will give non-science students firsthand experience                 
              with the way scientists gather data and solve problems.  The                   
              grantee will match the NSF award from non-Federal sources.
