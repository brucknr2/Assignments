Abstract    :
              To improve the biology undergraduate curriculum a spectrum of                  
              laboratory experiences in cellular and molecular biology were                  
              introduced that were not previously included in the curriculum                 
              of the college, which serves a significant number of women and                 
              Hispanics.  Biology majors enrolled in Cellular and Molecular                  
              Biology, Developmental Biology, Immunology, Genetics, and                      
              Microbiology are affected by the acquisition of equipment used                 
              to establish a cell and tissue culture room with facilities to                 
              carry out "in vitro" laboratory exercises with animal cells.                   
              The equipment improves the technical capabilities for                          
              fractionation, separation, detection and analysis of different
