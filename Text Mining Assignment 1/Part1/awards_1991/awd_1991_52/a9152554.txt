Abstract    :
              This project involves an updating and upgrading of materials                   
              testing facilities through the purchase of an universal testing                
              instrument and associated software.  The equipment primarily                   
              impacts four courses: Mechanics of Materials, Structural                       
              Engineering, Structural Behavior, and Materials of Engineering.                
              Only the first of these courses previously had a materials                     
              testing laboratory component; the project instrumentation                      
              allowed the addition of this capability to the other three                     
              courses.
