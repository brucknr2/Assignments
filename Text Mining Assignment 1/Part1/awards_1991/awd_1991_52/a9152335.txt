Abstract    :
              This project establishes a state-of-the-art Metrology Data                     
              Center.  This data center enables students in the Quality                      
              Engineering Technology program to learn efficient methods of                   
              collecting plant process and quality data and learn to use                     
              effective means of turning that mass of data into useful                       
              information for manufacturing decision making. The data center                 
              serves as a model of how plant quality labs can serve to assist                
              companies rise to world class competitors.  The primary piece                  
              of equipment is a coordinate measurement machine (CMM), which                  
              serves three departments; Quality Engineering, Computer-Aided                  
              Manufacturing (CAM), and Mechanical (CAD).  The CMM provides                   
              the basis for "reverse engineering" capability for the CAD                     
              program and precision measurement capability for the Quality                   
              and CAM programs.
