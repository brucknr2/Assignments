Abstract    :
                         Emphasizing Environmental Science                                   
              Studies"Instrumentation being funded through this project                      
              consists of a versatile gas chromatography system and a                        
              microprocessor-controlled environmental growth chamber.                        
              Biology and chemistry majors are employing these instruments in                
              their studies of microbial growth under special conditions,                    
              dynamics of small-scale biotic systems, and GC analysis of                     
              organic pollutants in natural waters.  Majors proficient in GC                 
              water analysis are working with non-majors to apply that                       
              technology in freshman-level environmental science projects.                   
              These projects serve as key bridging elements in a two-course                  
              sequence for non-science majors consisting of a chemistry                      
              course followed by an environmental science course.                            
              Instrumental methods introduced in the chemistry course enable                 
              students to perform environmental science laboratory exercises                 
              consistent with current professional practices.  Significant                   
              features of this project include collaboration between science                 
              majors and non-majors to address environmental concerns and the                
              development of an environmental science laboratory for non-                    
              majors.NSF grant funds are being matched with funds from non-                  
              federal sources.
