Abstract    :
              A multi-dimensional effort to develop high tech engineering                    
              skills among current and future workers has been initiated.                    
              This project, which is only one component of a broad approach                  
              to workforce preparedness, develops a CIM lab that will link                   
              the design, production, and inspection of machine parts, using                 
              industry-standard equipment and processes.  The CIM lab                        
              provides high-quality engineering education to young and older                 
              students whose future job potential depends on high tech                       
              skills.
