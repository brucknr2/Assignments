Abstract    :
              A 250 MHz FT NMR spectrometer with 1H and 13C detection and                    
              variable temperature capability is being acquired for use in                   
              beginning organic chemistry, seven advanced laboratories and                   
              undergraduate research. Students perform various 2-D and                       
              relaxation time measurements for structure determination and                   
              conformational analysis. The availability of off-line                          
              processing  increases the number of students able to gain                      
              firsthand experience with the instrument.
