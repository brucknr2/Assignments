Abstract    :
              This project results in the addition of automatic                              
              identification equipment (primarily bar code equipment) to the                 
              present manufacturing systems design lab. The equipment is used                
              to enhance the treatment of integrated materials handling                      
              systems design and real-time tracking and control, and enables                 
              students to work with various bar code technologies including                  
              scanning, printing, and data encoding.
