Abstract    :
              A laboratory is being developed which will provide more                        
              interdisciplinary approaches in the Calculus and Finite                        
              Mathematics courses, and which will incorporate                                
              interdisciplinary strategies and corresponding use of                          
              technology into other major and service courses.  The                          
              instructional strategies employed within the undergraduate                     
              courses will more effectively demonstrate the real-life                        
              applications of mathematics and statistics via scientific                      
              experimentation and data-gathering and
