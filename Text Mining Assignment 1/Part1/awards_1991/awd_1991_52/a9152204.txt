Abstract    :
              This project provides laboratory equipment to improve                          
              undergraduate instruction in the area of power electronics.                    
              With the equipment, students gain a basic understanding of (1)                 
              the topologies of power converters; (2) the characteristics of                 
              power devices; and (3) the design considerations of power                      
              switching components.  There are five workstations incorporated                
              in the project.  Each workstation consists of a digital/analog                 
              oscilloscope, dc/ac power supplies with various levels of                      
              voltages and currents, a data acquisition interface, two                       
              custom-built power FET control units, a custom-built polyphase                 
              SCR control unit, a temperature and current measurement                        
              instrument, and a plotter.  This equipment assists students                    
              with data acquisition and presentation of results for a variety                
              of laboratory experiments so that students are freed from                      
              tedious manual data collection.  The project provides students                 
              a unique opportunity to apply high-power switching techniques                  
              as well as to gain experience with the operation of the state-                 
              of-the-art equipment.
