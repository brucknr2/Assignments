Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry and Physics is purchasing a 60 MHz                 
              rapid scan NMR for use in sophomore and higher level chemistry                 
              courses. Hands-on student use of the NMR during the third week                 
              beginning organic chemistry course. The instrument is being                    
              used in the study of reaction stereochemistry, kinetics,                       
              determination of equilibrium constants, as well as the                         
              characterization of reaction products.
