Abstract    :
                The functioning of important compounds from drugs to enzymes                 
              to retinal pigments is related to their structure, geometry,                   
              and stereochemistry.  The two-semester organic chemistry                       
              laboratory will be revised by focusing on the theme of                         
              isomerism, because students frequently have difficulty learning                
              these structural concepts in the abstract and appreciating                     
              their importance.  Several experiments will be implemented in                  
              a problem-solving format that will involve students in learning                
              about optical isomers and chirality, structural and geometric                  
              isomers, and tautomers.  The instruments needed for these new                  
              experiments and to improve existing experiments include an FTIR                
              spectrophotometer and a polarimeter.  The grantee will match                   
              the NSF award from non-Federal sources.
