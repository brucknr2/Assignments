Abstract    :
              The project creates a state-of-the-art electronic architectural                
              design studio that utilizes advanced microcomputer simulation                  
              and visualization technology as the primary medium of building                 
              design exploration. This is distinguished by its conceptual                    
              design emphasis from the more conventional electronic drafting                 
              traditionally associated with computer-aided drafting. The                     
              capability of such a design-station studio permits the                         
              construction of realistic (opaque. shaded. colored) three-                     
              dimensional model images of student building or urban designs                  
              superimposed over video-capture image sequences of the                         
              existing, real building site, permitting realistic animated                    
              simulations of the proposed design. In addition, the project                   
              modifies the department's Junior Scholars summer program for                   
              high school students. The equipment includes thirteen networked                
              high-end Macintosh microcomputer design-stations with color                    
              graphic input and output peripheral devices and appropriate                    
              software to provide 3D visualization and video-capture                         
              simulation capability.
