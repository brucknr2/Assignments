Abstract    :
              This project exposes students to the capabilities of a wind                    
              tunnel, modern commercial fluid dynamics instrumentation, and                  
              the integration of a computer into data acquisition, data                      
              reduction and control of experiments. Various fluid dynamical                  
              principles are  demonstrated and some physical characteristics                 
              of turbulence are illustrated.  A pilot turbulence laboratory                  
              course for undergraduates, based entirely upon the wind tunnel,                
              is introduced.  In addition to the enhancement of various                      
              courses, the facility is used for demonstrations in a program                  
              for minority pre-college students.
