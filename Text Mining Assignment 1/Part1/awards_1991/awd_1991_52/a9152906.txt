Abstract    :
              This proposal is designed to support the development of a new                  
              undergraduate laboratory course in neuroscience. The goal of                   
              the course will expose students to the field of neuroscience                   
              with particular emphasis on the methods of cellular                            
              neuroscience. This course will provide laboratory training in                  
              neuroscience and behavior as it is practiced in the l990s and                  
              it will become one of the focal points for an undergraduate                    
              neuroscience and behavior "concentration" within the                           
              University. It is our intention to make the proposed laboratory                
              course the center piece of a more extensive research experience                
              for undergraduates. Our long range goal is to create a                         
              vertically integrated training enterprise that would attract                   
              undergraduates to careers in biology and to neuroscience in                    
              particular.  The requested equipment will serve the formal                     
              laboratory in one semester and will be the center of an honors                 
              laboratory and a Research Experience for Undergraduates program                
              in the second semester and during the summer months.
