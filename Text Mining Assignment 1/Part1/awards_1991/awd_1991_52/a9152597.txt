Abstract    :
              Instrumentation (UV spectrophotometer, densitomer analysis                     
              system, DNA sequencing unit, photo-documentation system, water                 
              purification apparatus, -70oC freezer, analytical balance,                     
              autoclave, and Macintosh computers) will support a new                         
              undergraduate research core requirement for students pursuing                  
              the B.S. degree in biology.  The equipment will substantially                  
              upgrade and modernize a student research laboratory in                         
              molecular genetics.  Students will gain experience in computer-                
              assisted data analysis and learn research techniques in the                    
              construction of operon fusions with bacterial genes, and                       
              methods for characterizing the regulation of the gene as well                  
              as its gene product.  The Research Core will consist of a                      
              series of three courses (Intro. to Biological Research,                        
              Research Techniques, and Independent Research) with emphasis in                
              the scientific method, literature search and review,                           
              experimental design, statistical data analysis (emphasis on                    
              using computer software packages), writing grant proposals,                    
              seminar preparation and deliver.  Students will design and                     
              carry out an independent research project in molecular genetics                
              under the guidance of a faculty research mentor.
