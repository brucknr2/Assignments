Abstract    :
              This project aims to improve instruction in neurobiology                       
              through the purchase of electrophysiological instruments, such                 
              as preamplifiers, stimulus isolation units, micromanipulators                  
              and storage oscilloscopes.  The equipment will be used in new                  
              exercises designed for the neurobiology laboratory course,                     
              including: 1) the compound action potential and sensory coding                 
              in cockroach giant axons; 2) the synaptic physiology of an                     
              insect neuromuscular junction; 3) intracellular physiology and                 
              single-cell labelling in the Helisoma buccal ganglion; and 4)                  
              the manipulation of cell membrane potential in muscle cells.                   
              Its additional use by students involved in Honors and                          
              independent research projects will broaden the opportunities                   
              for undergraduate research.
