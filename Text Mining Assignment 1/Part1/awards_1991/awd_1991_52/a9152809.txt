Abstract    :
              This project provides an instructional wind tunnel facility for                
              a fluid mechanics laboratory.  The equipment includes a 12-inch                
              wind tunnel with an instrumentation system, a microcomputer,                   
              hardware and software for an automatic data acquisition and                    
              analysis system and a digital multimanometer.  This equipment,                 
              together with existing facilities, completes and improves                      
              instruction in the fluid mechanics laboratory by enabling                      
              students to perform experiments in the areas of boundary layer                 
              and external flows.  The capability of computer interfacing                    
              allows students to carry out the proposed experiments                          
              previously deemed too laborious or impractical by traditional                  
              methods.
