Abstract    :
              The Animal Physiology labs at Holy Cross offer a rather unique                 
              lab experience.  Not only do the students do a number of                       
              exercises typical to many such labs, but they also are heavily                 
              encouraged to be independent and to understand all aspects of                  
              experimental work: design, ethics, principles of the operation                 
              of equipment, the role an sources of variation, interpretation                 
              and written and oral presentation.  Recently, we have also                     
              incorporated independent projects.  However, we have been                      
              hampered by lack of two critical pieces of equipment: oxygen                   
              and carbon dioxide analyzers.  Whereas in other regards, we are                
              exceptionally well equipped, the lack of ability to easily                     
              analyze reparatory gases greatly reduces the quality of labs                   
              that are central to the course (which emphasizes reparation and                
              metabolism).  It severely restricts the scope of student                       
              projects and forces them to do less than they are capable of                   
              and wish to do.  To remedy this situation, we are requesting an                
              oxygen analyzer to augment the one already present and three                   
              carbon dioxide analyzers.
