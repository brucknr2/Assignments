Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry is purchasing an FT-IR for use in                  
              organic, analytical and physical chemistry laboratories. The                   
              students are using the instrument to analyze reaction products,                
              study reaction rates, and determine molecular constants for                    
              several gases. The instrument also is being used in                            
              undergraduate research projects investigating polymeric                        
              materials.
