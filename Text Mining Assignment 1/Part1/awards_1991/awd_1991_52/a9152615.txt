Abstract    :
               Toward Making Mathematics a Laboratory ScienceUsing state of                  
              the art Computer Algebra Systems and working in teams, students                
              are experimenting with applying mathematics to physics and                     
              engineering problems. Emphasis is on modeling, insight,                        
              conceptual understanding and interpretation of results, rather                 
              than on routine calculations. The aim of the projects is to                    
              profoundly effect the teaching of the freshman/sophomore                       
              sequence, and ultimately all of the curricula. The plan is to                  
              focus on the relatively few truly central ideas, to make them                  
              memorable, and to stress the interrelation between these key                   
              mathematical concepts and their relevance to the world of                      
              science and engineering.
