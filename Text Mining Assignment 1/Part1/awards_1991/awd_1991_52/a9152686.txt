Abstract    :
              The Department of Geography and Geology is equipping a                         
              laboratory for a geographic information systems (GIS). The                     
              laboratory is being used by students in three existing courses                 
              and to institute a new course in introductory and intermediate                 
              GIS techniques recommended by the National Center for                          
              Geographic Information Analysis.  The original introductory GIS                
              class is being expanded into two courses enabling students to                  
              receive more applied "hands-on" experience with both a raster                  
              and vector-based GIS.  The laboratory is providing                             
              undergraduates with extensive GIS laboratory experience via the                
              software packages, IDRlSI and
