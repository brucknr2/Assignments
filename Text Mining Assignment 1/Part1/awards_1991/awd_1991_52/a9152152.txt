Abstract    :
              An introductory astronomy course for non-science majors,                       
              previously a lecture and demonstration course, is being                        
              upgraded to include a strong laboratory component.                             
              Observations, both qualitative and  quantitative play a major                  
              role in the new laboratory.  Small telescopes make the                         
              observational component of this new course possible. A variety                 
              of observing projects are generating an appreciation of natural                
              phenomena unobtainable from lectures alone, and also giving                    
              students the experience of obtaining, reducing, and explaining                 
              experimental data.
