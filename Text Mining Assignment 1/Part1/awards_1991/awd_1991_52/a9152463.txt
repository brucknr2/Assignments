Abstract    :
              The Electronics and Computer Systems Technology programs at                    
              Parkland College are developing new methods to teach the non-                  
              traditional student, and to integrate the computer into the                    
              curriculum.  An existing laboratory with 12 test benches is                    
              being converted into a laboratory with computer integrated                     
              technology work/test stations linked together with a local area                
              network.  The work/test stations put the student in control of                 
              a multi-media learning environment that is being matched to                    
              their learning styles.  This allows the student to visualize                   
              concepts, aid design, simulate system performance, and control                 
              equipment and analyze designs.  The Laboratory also is to be a                 
              resource for the Engineering Science and Technology Department.
