Abstract    :
              Two microcomputer classroom/laboratories with Macintosh IIsi's                 
              are supporting a new Introductory Mathematics Program. This                    
              program consists of six courses; Workshops on Quantitative                     
              Reasoning, Statistics with Applications, Mathematics with                      
              Applications I & II, and Calculus I & II. The successful                       
              learner-centered pedagogical approach already employed in                      
              discrete mathematics and introductory computer science is                      
              replacing the traditional lecture format. Students work                        
              collaboratively on computer exercises specially designed to                    
              help them construct mathematical ideas on their own and acquire                
              transferable skills that can be used in further study in                       
              mathematics and the natural and social sciences.
