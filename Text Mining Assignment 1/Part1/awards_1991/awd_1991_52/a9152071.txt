Abstract    :
              A laboratory is being developed for the purpose of conducting                  
              experiments and demonstrations on the principles of plasmas and                
              plasma processes.  The RIT facility is well equipped with tools                
              for the production of integrated circuit chips.  This facility                 
              includes plasma etching equipment, but it is heavily automated                 
              and mechanically inflexible, making it difficult to use for                    
              demonstrations and experiments.  This project will provide                     
              demonstrations and experiments designed to improve student                     
              understanding of plasma formation, plasma etching, and                         
              sputtering.  The major components of the apparatus are (1) the                 
              plasma chamber (2) vacuum pumping system and (3) gas flow                      
              controls.  The assembled apparatus will be interfaced with                     
              existing plasma diagnostic instruments for use.  Laboratory                    
              demonstrations are planned to show the spectra of the plasma                   
              light emission, the chemical species in the plasma itself with                 
              and without etching, the sputtering phenomenon, and the various                
              effects of parameters such as pressure, feed gas composition,                  
              Ac vs. DC power, and electrode spacing.
