Abstract    :
              With the increased use of the computer in the classroom it is                  
              imperative that prospective mathematics teachers know how to                   
              use computers and appropriate software in ways that augment the                
              learning process.  Prospective teachers getting the best                       
              background possible by using this computer laboratory equipped                 
              with computers with the MS DOS operating system and running                    
              software that is used in schools.  These prospective teachers                  
              are explore, formulate and test conjectures, and make devise                   
              proof or counterexamples in an environment that they can                       
              replicate in their classrooms.
