Abstract    :
              The Department of Mathematics and Computer Science at Pembroke                 
              State University is updating and upgrading the computer                        
              equipment available for use in its courses for preservice                      
              teachers.  Preservice teachers need to learn how and when to                   
              use the computer as a tool in their classrooms, especially                     
              prospective science and mathematics teachers.  The computer                    
              tools they use during their education must be up to date.                      
              These tools should be similar to those they might expect to                    
              encounter as new teachers but preferably somewhat better.  Two                 
              important aspects of modern educational computing are computer                 
              networking and multimedia use of the computer.  The new                        
              equipment is networked and has multimedia capability to allow                  
              the inclusion of these topics in the curriculum.  The equipment                
              is also used to make improvements in the general introductory                  
              course for non-majors.
