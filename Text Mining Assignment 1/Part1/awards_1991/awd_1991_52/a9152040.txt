Abstract    :
              The Saint Mary's College Biology Department has identified a                   
              need to improve and expand the microscopy in upper division                    
              laboratory activities across a wide range of biological                        
              curricula, including genetics, cell biology, molecular biology,                
              physiology, microbiology, histology, immunology, and student                   
              research.  The entire array of objectives can be met by the                    
              acquisition of twenty-two high resolution microscopes and an                   
              automatic photomicrography system that are interchangeable with                
              the research-grade microscopes already available in the                        
              department.  The acquisition will allow for maximal student                    
              activity in conducting laboratory exercises which previously                   
              have been plagued with a shortage of high quality microscopes.                 
              The exercises in question include a number of activities                       
              focused on genetic, cellular, and microbial phenomena, all of                  
              which yield results that naturally unfold into numerous                        
              biological and molecular concepts for additional discussion.
