Abstract    :
              The aim of the project is to introduce dynamic operation,                      
              control and analysis into the energy laboratory via a new heat                 
              pump experiment that is to be developed and constructed using                  
              a vapor compression cycle. It consists of a 1 to 2 ton                         
              refrigeration compressor driven by a programmable variable                     
              speed drive, and arranged so that "heat" can be pumped in                      
              either direction between two identical insulated liquid filled                 
              tanks. Valves are provided so that the role of the evaporator                  
              and condenser can be reversed.  This allows a rapid cycle time                 
              so that several dynamic experiments can be run during the                      
              course of a single two hour laboratory period. The pressure,                   
              temperature, flow, motor speed and torque transducers will                     
              input to a PC via an A/D convertor so that the transient can be                
              recorded and displayed, and so that data analysis can be                       
              performed. The students can examine how the system responds to                 
              changing loads, they can observe the change in COP during the                  
              course of the work cycle, and they can consider several control                
              strategies in an effort to minimize energy consumption. A                      
              synergy of energy and design related concepts is emphasized in                 
              the experimental design.
