Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to introduce inquiry-based and                     
              problem                                                                        
              solving approaches into microscopy laboratories, which have                    
              traditionally                                                                  
              been descriptive in nature.  This is accomplished by using                     
              MacIntosh IIci                                                                 
              workstations as part of an image analysis system in a network                  
              configuration to capture, store and share microscopy images                    
              from living                                                                    
              and preserved materials.  Students in courses such as                          
              Developmental

              for later                                                                      
              analysis and/or presentation, images captured from their                       
              microscopes, and                                                               
              present the processed images as three dimensional                              
              reconstructions or
