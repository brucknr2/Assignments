Abstract    :
              This project is establishing an undergraduate scientific                       
              visualization laboratory at the University of Wisconsin-La                     
              Crosse. Visualization technology is changing the way in which                  
              science is performed by providing new ways to apprehend                        
              structure in science. For exactly these reasons, visualization                 
              technology can have a profound impact on the way undergraduate                 
              students study science. The laboratory being established                       
              consists of three-dimensional graphics workstations and a                      
              compatible video projector.  Software to support applications                  
              of scientific visualization is being obtained through a                        
              combination of local development, using student programmers,                   
              and commercial sources. The project members are beginning                      
              development of applications in Quantum Chemistry, X-Ray                        
              Diffraction, Protein Conformation and Function, Numerical                      
              Solutions of Differential Equations, Orbital Mechanics, and                    
              Neural Networks. Providing undergraduate students with access                  
              to visualization technology will have a deep and lasting effect                
              on their understanding of science and their motivation to                      
              pursue further study.
