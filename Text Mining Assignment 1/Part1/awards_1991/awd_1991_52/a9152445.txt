Abstract    :
              The purpose of this project is to establish global positioning                 
              system (GPS) capabilities for a civil engineering technology                   
              program.  With GPS (satellite positioning) becoming accepted                   
              and commonly used in science and industry, there is a need to                  
              teach this emerging surveying technology.  The project provides                
              3 GPS receivers with antennas, two dedicated personal computers                
              to reduce the satellite data, and the necessary data reduction                 
              and network adjustment software.
