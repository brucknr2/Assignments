Abstract    :
              The production and processing of materials into finished goods                 
              constitutes a large part of our present economy.  A significant                
              portion of new products are developed from synthetic polymeric                 
              materials including composite materials.  The Chemical                         
              Engineering Department at Rose-Hulman introduced a senior                      
              elective course in Polymer Engineering some years ago. and it                  
              includes laboratory experience.  A Fourier Transform Infrared                  
              Spectrometer (FTIR) is being added to the laboratory to allow                  
              students to perform compositional analysis, structural                         
              analysis, and analysis on polymer morphology on homopolymers,                  
              copolymers, polymer blends and composite materials.  The                       
              capabilities of the FTIR instrument also allows performance of                 
              these analyses on opaque materials which was almost impossible                 
              with the existing, older dispersive instruments.
