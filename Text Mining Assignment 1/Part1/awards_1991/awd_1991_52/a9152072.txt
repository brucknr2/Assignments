Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to enhance learning of                        
              concepts and problem-solving skills by engaging students with                  
              hypermedial tools throughout the curriculum.  A microcomputer-                 
              based laboratory consisting of student workstations networked                  
              with a server are incorporated into the introductory core                      
              curriculum courses (Diversity, Ecology/Evolutionary Biology,                   
              Genetics, and Molecular/Cellular/Developmental Biology), a                     
              research methods course, upper division elective courses, and                  
              non-major's courses to enhance the teaching of major biological                
              concepts and scientific problem-solving skills.  Interactive                   
              object-oriented software (utilizing a Macintosh interface)                     
              serve as the platform to address learning of concepts through                  
              a) computer databases, b) simulations, c) computer-based data                  
              collection exercises, and d) data analysis exercises of                        
              laboratory or field-collected data.  Problem-solving skills are                
              addressed with hypermedial tools that provide a) database                      
              support, b) graphical support, c) statistical support, and d)                  
              productivity support.
