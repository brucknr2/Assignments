Abstract    :
              A 250 MHz Fourier transform nuclear magnetic resonance                         
              spectrometer will affect both lecture and laboratory courses.                  
              Lecture courses will present the theoretical basis of FT-NMR                   
              spectroscopy and introduce various applications.  Laboratory                   
              courses will provide practical experience in operation of the                  
              FT-NMR and extensive practice in interpretation of spectral                    
              data.  Routine operation of the FT-NMR and analysis of typical                 
              proton and C-13 spectra, including two dimensional H,C                         
              correlation spectra, will be stressed in the organic chemistry                 
              laboratory.  Junior level courses will introduce variable                      
              temperature FT-NMR to learn conformational analysis, and                       
              physicochemical parameters will be extracted from NMR spectra.                 
              Seniors will learn to obtain more complex spectra such as DEPT                 
              and APT.  They will gain practical experience with the NMR of                  
              other nuclei including B, Ga, Fe, Mo, N, and P together with                   
              other NMR-active metallic elements.  The grantee will match the                
              NSF award from non-federal sources.
