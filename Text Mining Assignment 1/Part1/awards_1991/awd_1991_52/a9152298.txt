Abstract    :
              The University has recently established a concentration in                     
              modern optics within the B.S Program in Physics. Some of the                   
              basic equipment for this laboratory has been acquired as                       
              donations from local high tech companies. At present, the major                
              lab equipment includes a Zygo Interferometer and Genesee                       
              Optical Design Software for use by students. This project has                  
              as its goal a high quality education in optics for those                       
              students going on to the Ph.D.  In addition, it is benefitting                 
              students who go directly to work for some of the local                         
              employers in Silicon Valley.  Experiments are being done in 6                  
              areas:  lens systems, fiber optics, interferometry, holography,                
              diffraction and Fourier optics, and polarization.   The                        
              equipment continues the modernization and improvement of the                   
              Optics Laboratory.
