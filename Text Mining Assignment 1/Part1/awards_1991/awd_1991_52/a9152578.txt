Abstract    :
              This project provides Electrical Engineering Technology                        
              undergraduate students with a low cost and modern approach to                  
              laboratory instrumentation, circuit and system design.  This                   
              laboratory facility allows the students to quickly access                      
              hardware and software programs so they can do both analysis and                
              design of circuits and systems.  Analog-to-digital and digital-                
              to-analog converters and software added to the personal                        
              computers allow the students to build complex systems,                         
              concentrating on the principles.  Because of the flexibility,                  
              the system can be customized to suit investigative and/or                      
              educational problems. With powerful software design tools and                  
              interface hardware students design, simulate, and test circuits                
              and systems from the workstation.  The equipment allows                        
              electrical engineering technology students to design and                       
              analyze systems with the same operating technology as their                    
              industrial counterparts, and learn industry standard operations                
              and practices.
