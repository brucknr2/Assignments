Abstract    :
              The University of Texas (UT)is establishing a molecular                        
              graphics teaching laboratory for students in Organic Chemistry                 
              and Medicinal Chemistry. The laboratory provides students with                 
              an enhanced understanding of how 3-dimensional molecular                       
              structure affects the intrinsic properties and bioactivities of                
              chemical compounds. Computer-graphic display and manipulation                  
              of molecular structures is useful in predicting drug efficacy                  
              and suggesting the synthesis of new compounds as potentially                   
              useful drugs or agrochemicals.
