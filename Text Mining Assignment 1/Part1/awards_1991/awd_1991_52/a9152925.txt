Abstract    :
              The purpose of this project is to introduce modern instruments                 
              and technology into the Engineering Technology curriculum and                  
              to allow development of new ways of using modern instruments to                
              provide improved instructional capabilities.  The data-                        
              acquisition systems consist of an AT-class computer and                        
              associated boards and software.  External assemblies containing                
              conditioning and protection devices are accessible for student                 
              experimentation.  The equipment is used in the                                 
              computer/electronic labs and the mechanical engineering                        
              technology laboratories.  The electronic/computer engineering                  
              technology students learn how to select and install data                       
              acquisition systems, how to program them at all levels, how to                 
              reduce and analyze data obtained, and how to interface external                
              devices of all kinds.  The mechanical engineering technology                   
              students use the equipment to perform measurements and for data                
              analysis and reduction, which can be done at a much higher                     
              level of sophistication utilizing the available software.
