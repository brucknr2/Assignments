Abstract    :
              This project provides instrumentation needed to demonstrate in                 
              the laboratory major topics covered in the ocean engineering                   
              classroom.  The instruments are capable of good quality data,                  
              but are sensible for undergraduate use and provide a means for                 
              students to gain a wider knowledge of the marine environment.                  
              The equipment consists of a trailer and 22' aluminum boat with                 
              sonar, radar, ocean profiler, sediment corer, winch,                           
              communications, and navigational aids of several sorts tied                    
              into a laptop computer all trailerable by any 3000 lb. rated                   
              pickup.  The package is used by all students, whether entering                 
              freshmen, or seniors with ocean-oriented senior projects                       
              preparing to graduate.
