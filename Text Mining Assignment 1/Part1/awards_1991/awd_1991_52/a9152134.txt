Abstract    :
              An integrated lecture-laboratory course in contemporary Applied                
              Optics is being implemented.  The course is addressed mainly to                
              physics juniors and seniors, but other science and engineering                 
              students will be attracted to it.  The objectives of the course                
              are: (1) improvement of student's perception of physics as                     
              useful in the "real world"; (2) enhancement of prospect of                     
              employment by industry of physics graduates, and (3) increase                  
              of opportunity for "hands on" experience in current techniques                 
              and methods useful in experimental physics.  The laboratory                    
              includes experiments in optical radiation detectors,                           
              optoelectronic laser beam manipulation, holography, optical                    
              image processing, and fiber optics.  This course serves as a                   
              prototype for other courses in applied physics in the                          
              department.  The final goal is the increased participation of                  
              minority students in science careers.NSF grant funds are being                 
              matched with funds from non-federal sources.
