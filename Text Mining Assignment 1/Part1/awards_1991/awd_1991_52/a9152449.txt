Abstract    :
              A grating UV-VIS spectrophotometer complete with computer                      
              interface, kinetic and analytical software, and a thermostated                 
              sample holder will be used in three undergraduate laboratories.                
              The instrumentation will allow majors in intermediate-level                    
              courses (organic, biochemistry, and instrumental analysis) to                  
              observe and measure chemical and biochemical dynamics.  During                 
              the summer months the instrument will be used for undergraduate                
              research in the training of Native American undergraduates,                    
              Native American high school students, and area teachers.  This                 
              department anticipates heavy usage of this instrument during                   
              the entire year.  The grantee will match the NSF award from                    
              non-Federal sources.
