Abstract    :
              This project develops a student laboratory for a new Electrical                
              Engineering Technology course which combines three specialty                   
              areas: instrumentation, microprocessors, and programmable logic                
              controllers.  Equipment in the laboratory includes                             
              oscilloscopes, function generators, and personal computers with                
              lEEE 488 bus controller cards to interface with the                            
              instrumentation.  Programmable logic controllers and software,                 
              microcontroller development systems, conveyors, and robots also                
              are provided.  The culmination of student experiments in this                  
              laboratory is an industrial type project to automatically                      
              adjust and test circuit boards.  The students configure and                    
              program the equipment so that the programmable logic controller                
              positions the robot arm, and the microcontroller adjusts a                     
              potentiometer with the robot until a desired voltage is                        
              measured, and the personal computer and instrumentation tests                  
              the board to verify operation.  This project is significant                    
              within the curriculum because in no existing course or                         
              laboratory are instrumentation, computers, microcontrollers,                   
              and programmable logic controllers interfaced together.
