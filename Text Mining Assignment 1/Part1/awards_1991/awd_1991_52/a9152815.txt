Abstract    :
              The Electronics Engineering Technology (EET) department at                     
              Oregon Institute of Technology offers Bachelor degrees in two                  
              programs: EET and L0ET (Laser Optical Engineering Technology).                 
              This project equips a laboratory, shared by EET and LOET, with                 
              two comprehensive, computer controlled, fiber optic measurement                
              systems.  These systems provide for both optical and                           
              communication characterization.  The EET students use a                        
              realistic communication system complete with a kilometer or                    
              more of channel length.  The L0ET students use the same                        
              communication system plus the ability to accurately and quickly                
              measure the optical properties of fibers.  Computer automation                 
              of the system shortens the data acquisition time and allows for                
              more creative student activities.
