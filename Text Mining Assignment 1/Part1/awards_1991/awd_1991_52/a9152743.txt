Abstract    :
              The National Undergraduate Research Observatory (NURO) is a                    
              consortium of 11 primarily undergraduate institutions who have                 
              joined together to encourage more students to go into science                  
              by introducing them to state-of-the-art research.  The focus of                
              NURO is a 31-inch telescope belonging to Lowell Observatory and                
              located near Flagstaff, Arizona.  The consortium, directed from                
              Northern Arizona University, is using a charge-coupled device                  
              (CCD) camera and associated computing equipment to make                        
              astronomical observations in courses and for student research,                 
              particularly the monitoring of supernova light curves and the                  
              determination of obits of faint asteroids.
