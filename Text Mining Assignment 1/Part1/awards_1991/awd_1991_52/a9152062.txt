Abstract    :
              The development of the laboratory for System Noise in                          
              Electronic Design makes use of some excellent advances in                      
              instrument technology to help undergraduate students learn                     
              about the practical considerations of system noise, both as it                 
              affects their design, and as generated by their design. These                  
              considerations of Electromagnetic Compatibility between the                    
              electronics and the system are often overlooked and seldom                     
              taught, but nearly always of real concern. Three specific areas                
              are covered in this project: the influence of a reference                      
              (ground) shift due to switching current in an inductive                        
              reference; the susceptibility of electronics to                                
              additive/modulating spurious signals; and the conducted                        
              interference generated by switching electronics. In all cases                  
              the students observe the effects and means of reduction of the                 
              noise through practical experiments in the laboratory.
