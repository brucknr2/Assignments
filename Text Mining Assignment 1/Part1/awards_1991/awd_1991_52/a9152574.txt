Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to enhance the laboratory                          
              experiences of advanced undergraduate majors in the Biology and                
              Biochemistry programs by supporting the development of an                      
              undergraduate laboratory with two bioreactor workstations, and                 
              IBM- compatible computers and data translation boards to                       
              support them.  The purchase of generic A/D acquisition boards                  
              and software allow the computers to be interfaced with other                   
              laboratory instruments such as chromatographs and                              
              spectrophotometers.  The equipment is also used in independent                 
              undergraduate research projects.
