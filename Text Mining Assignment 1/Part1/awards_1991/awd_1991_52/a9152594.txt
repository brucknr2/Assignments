Abstract    :
              The majority of the students in introductory physics courses                   
              experience serious conceptual difficulties in relating time-                   
              dependent kinematic and dynamic observables.  The current                      
              literature suggests that (a) this problem is not unique to one                 
              institution, and (b) that microcomputer based laboratories                     
              (MBL's) can be used effectively to develop higher order                        
              cognitive skills.  The most successful documented approach uses                
              position, velocity, and force sensors interfaced with a                        
              microcomputer equipped with the software to perform real-time                  
              analysis.  The project uses hardware and software currently                    
              available on the market,  and standard laboratory                              
              investigations are adapted to a cognitive science approach to                  
              instruction.  The same microcomputer is being used as measuring                
              instrument, analytical tool, graphic display unit, repository                  
              of assignment write-ups, and tutorial aid.  Pedagogical                        
              effectiveness is assessed through a standard hypothesis-testing                
              procedure. Results are being disseminated through standard                     
              publication channels, workshops for local high school physics                  
              instructors, and ultimately summer student workshops.
