Abstract    :
              A PC-Compatible lab anda Macintosh lab are being developed to                  
              conduct courses inintroductory mathematics using the computer                  
              algebra systems ofDerive and Maple, and the already purchased, HP              
              48SX calculators. The goals are to expose undergraduates in                    
              mathematics, mathematics education, engineering, computer                      
              science, physics, and chemistry to the use of state-of-the-art                 
              technology in calculus, linear algebra, and differential                       
              equations courses; to  compare computer algebra systems                        
              software and hardware to determine which system is best suited                 
              for classroom use; and to conduct short- and long-term                         
              educational studies comparing the performance of students among                
              those in the computer algebra classes, and comparing the                       
              performance to those in traditional classes.
