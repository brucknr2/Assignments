Abstract    :
              This project is providing specialized optical analysis                         
              equipment for use by advanced optics students at the University                
              of Rochester Institute of Optics.Optical fabrication technology                
              relies upon the unique skills of master opticians for the                      
              production of specialized optics.  Small, ultra-thin crystal                   
              windows, glass prisms with sharp edges, aspheric germanium                     
              lenses or optically-contacted elements are made to sub-micron                  
              tolerances by these craftsmen, who traditionally have learned                  
              their techniques in extensive apprentice programs at trade                     
              schools in Eastern Europe.The hands-on fundamentals of optical                 
              fabrication are being passed on to undergraduates by two master                
              opticians at the University of Rochester in a laboratory course                
              initiated by the principal investigator three years ago.                       
              Projects take students through glass melting, casting,                         
              annealing, and into hand fabrication of precision lenses,                      
              flats, and prisms.  Students and their employers find this                     
              course to be valuable, because it teaches just how costly it                   
              can be to improperly tolerance optical elements when designing                 
              products.With the non-contacting surface profiler and phase-                   
              shifting interferometer acquired through this project, students                
              are being trained to use modern instrumentation for studying                   
              fabrication issues ranging from sub-surface damage to optical                  
              inhomogeneity created by stirring of the glass melt.  This new                 
              instrumentation is comparable to that currently found in most                  
              industrial laboratories and quality-assurance departments.NSF                  
              grant funds are being matched with funds from non-federal                      
              sources.
