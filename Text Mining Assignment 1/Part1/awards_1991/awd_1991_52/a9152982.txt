Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to use tissue culture techniques to                
              introduce upper-level biology students to current concepts in                  
              molecular cell biology.  A sterile hood CO2 incubator, inverted                
              and epifluoresence microscopes, a cryo-storage thermos, and a                  
              vertical slab gel electrophoresis system were purchased to                     
              implement these experiments.  Students isolate membrane                        
              fractions from cultured cells using ultracentrifugation                        
              techniques.  Membranes and whole cells are stained using                       
              primary antibodies to specific proteins and organelles and                     
              peroxidase-labelled and fluorescent-labelled secondary                         
              antibodies.  Viral transformation is demonstrated using primary                
              chick fibroblasts and Rous sarcoma virus, and students observe                 
              and quantitate the transformation utilizing the inverted                       
              microscope and pulse-labelling techniques.  Chemical signaling                 
              is demonstrated through the addition of defined hormones to a                  
              BC3H1 cell line that cause differentiation of these cells into                 
              the muscle phenotype.  Western and Northern blotting are also                  
              demonstrated with tissue-cultured cells.
