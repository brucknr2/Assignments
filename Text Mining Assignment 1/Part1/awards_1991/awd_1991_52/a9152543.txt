Abstract    :
              St.  John's College, with its unique approach to education, has                
              been particularly successful at integrating the sciences into                  
              a liberal arts curriculum.  Because a working knowledge of                     
              observational astronomy is fundamental to understanding many of                
              the readings of the St.  John's program, in music and                          
              literature as well as in mathematics and physics, St. John's                   
              College is upgrading its capabilities with the purchase of a                   
              14" telescope, equipped for photometric applications, installed                
              in a permanently mounted dome on the Annapolis campus.  A                      
              faculty study group is developing manuals and collecting                       
              original papers to guide the use of astronomical telescopes in                 
              a liberal arts setting.The addition of this telescope and                      
              laboratory manuals materially enhances the science portion of                  
              the curriculum and also benefits all other parts of the St.                    
              John's program.  This project may be a model for other liberal                 
              arts colleges and a growing number of secondary schools who                    
              have expressed interest in the program.
