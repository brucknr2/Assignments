Abstract    :
              The Mathematical Sciences Department at Worcester Polytechnic                  
              Institute is redesigning its undergraduate calculus and linear                 
              algebra curriculum in order to take advantage of new technology                
              and direct the focus of the course more towards engineering                    
              applications.  This new approach involves bringing substantial                 
              applications from nonlinear programming into the calculus and                  
              linear algebra sequence, as many of these problems involve                     
              immediate applications of the basic concepts taught in these                   
              courses. A second focus of the new sequence involves                           
              mathematics majors in the development of course materials,                     
              including instructional software, as part of their senior year                 
              projects.
