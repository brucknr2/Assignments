Abstract    :
              The goal of this proposal is to develop a stimulating                          
              laboratory program for students in the College's Ecology and                   
              Environmental Technology (EET) program.  The acquisition of a                  
              bench scale Sequential Batch Reactor system allows students to                 
              observe and analyze microbial populations and evaluate the                     
              effects of nutrients and other environmental parameters on                     
              biochemical processes within the reactors.  Kinetic constants                  
              of the processes may also be determined, providing for the                     
              construction of predictive mathematical models.  The                           
              bioreactors allow students to use microorganisms as models to                  
              demonstrate basic scientific principles, and learn about the                   
              application microorganisms and bioreactors in the management of                
              wastes.
