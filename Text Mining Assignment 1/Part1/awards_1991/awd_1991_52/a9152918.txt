Abstract    :
              Application of the laser is so widespread in industry and                      
              research that today's undergraduates, especially those                         
              considering a scientific career need an exposure to lasers and                 
              modern optics at the undergraduate level.  This project expands                
              the two-semester sophomore Optics Laboratory course at                         
              Manhattan College to include experiments using lasers and                      
              modern instrumentation.  The optics laboratory is envisioned as                
              the place where students gain experimental facility in the use                 
              of this equipment in order to prepare them for future                          
              independent research.  The final six weeks of the course are                   
              dedicated to independent but guided project work which                         
              interested students could pursue in their junior and senior                    
              years with a view toward completion of the project in their                    
              Senior Thesis course.  In order to carry out this program,                     
              equipment is being acquired which serves the following                         
              purposes:a) provides students with a wide range of options in                  
              their selection of a project, b) enables students to gain some                 
              facility in the operation of the up-to-date optical equipment                  
              and instrumentation, and c)is sophisticated enough to allow                    
              students to continue development of their projects through                     
              their junior and senior years.  NSF grant funds are being                      
              matched with funds from non-federal sources.
