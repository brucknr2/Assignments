Abstract    :
              A new Laboratory is being created to enable the Computer                       
              Science Department to offer its majors experience in the design                
              and implementation of parallel computing systems.  The students                
              work with three types of parallel systems: extensively                         
              pipelined uniprocessors with multiple execution units,                         
              multiprocessors using shared memory, and message passing                       
              multiprocessor systems.  The new course completes a sequence of                
              three courses; the other two courses are a lecture course in                   
              computer architecture, and a laboratory course in microcomputer                
              systems design.  In the new laboratory each group of two                       
              students works with an Intel 386 based IBM AT clone equipped                   
              with a CSA Transputer board, a Microway i860 board, and a logic                
              analyzer board.  The ATs are networked to a laboratory file and                
              print server, and furnish I/0 facilities to the installed                      
              boards.  The Intel i860 provides the vehicle for investigating                 
              parallel uniprocessors.  The Transputer board introduces                       
              students to message passing multiprocessor systems.  A 16 node                 
              reconfigurable Transputer system, hosted by a separate AT,                     
              permits the students to implement on a real multiprocessor the                 
              software that they have developed, and enables them to                         
              investigate the link operation and link driver/receiver design.                
              Microway's 860 boards are each equipped with two links which                   
              will enable the student to develop an asymmetric                               
              multiprocessing system with the Transputer.  Shared memory                     
              multiprocessors are made up of existing multiple Intel 8086                    
              boards housed in a Multibus equipped card cage.
