Abstract    :
              A new astronomical observatory at Bennington College equipped                  
              through this project provides undergraduate students at all                    
              levels with an enriching experience in observational astronomy.                
              The centerpiece is a high quality, easy to use, computer-                      
              controlled reflecting telescope.  It is equipped with a CCD                    
              camera and photometer.  Beginning students are able to find and                
              observe more celestial objects, while more advanced students                   
              are able to complete laboratory projects in astrophotography                   
              and photometry in conjunction with advanced courses, and                       
              undergraduate thesis students use it for research projects such                
              as studying variable stars.  This observatory enriches the                     
              whole physical science curriculum at the college.  In addition,                
              the observatory is a community resource through programs for                   
              local elementary and secondary schools and for in-service                      
              training of teachers in those schools.
