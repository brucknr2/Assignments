Abstract    :
              The goal of the project is to improve the quality of                           
              engineering education by introducing comprehensive laboratory                  
              experience in order to complement the existing theoretically                   
              based courses in design and manufacturing at the undergraduate                 
              mechanical engineering level.  The major equipment includes an                 
              integrated computer-aided design/manufacturing software system                 
              and a numerically controlled vertical machining center. The                    
              project gives the students an understanding of how integration                 
              is a main component of successful design and production.
