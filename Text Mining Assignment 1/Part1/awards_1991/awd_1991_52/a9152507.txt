Abstract    :
              A 300 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer will be                
              used in three sophomore-level organic chemistry lab courses,                   
              two junior-level physical chemistry lab courses, and senior-                   
              level laboratory courses in inorganic chemistry and chemical                   
              spectroscopy.  The instrument will strengthen the organic                      
              courses, which are taught in a non-traditional way that                        
              emphasizes interpretative skills.  The principles of relaxation                
              and coherence will be illustrated in the experiments in                        
              physical chemistry.  Two-dimensional NMR will be introduced in                 
              the senior level molecular spectroscopy course.  This                          
              instrument will also be used to acquire data for students at                   
              other colleges in the region.  Methods of performing rapid ID                  
              NMR calculations on personal computers will be tested.  This                   
              project was funded jointly by the USEME Division and the                       
              Chemistry Division.
