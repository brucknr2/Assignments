Abstract    :
              Gustavus Adolphus College is enhancing the genetics program                    
              within the biology department's curriculum by including current                
              nucleic acid and protein analyses. Recombinant DNA techniques                  
              have revolutionized the discipline of genetics, and the College                
              has made a major commitment to teach these methodologies to the                
              scientists it prepares. At the advanced level, DNA sequencing                  
              and sequence analysis will be taught in Molecular Genetics, as                 
              well as other methods of gene analysis. Bacterial                              
              transformation, plasmid isolation, and DNA restriction analysis                
              by electrophoresis will be taught in Genetics, a required                      
              course for majors. In addition, DNA isolation and                              
              electrophoretic techniques will be included at the introductory                
              level in General Biology. Funds are sought from NSF to aid in                  
              the acquisition of DNA sequencing units, power supplies, gel                   
              electrophoresis units, and other support equipment that will                   
              allow students the opportunity to practice these methodologies.
