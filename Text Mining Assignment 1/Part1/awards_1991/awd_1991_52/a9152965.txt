Abstract    :
              A major enhancement of the Computer-Aided-Design and Test                      
              Laboratory has begun to support a new minor in VLSI Systems                    
              Engineering for the Computer Engineering and Electrical                        
              Engineering B.S. degree programs of the Electrical and Computer                
              Engineering Department.  A large-capacity file-server, two                     
              digital ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuit) testers,                
              a logic analyzer, eight host-controlled functional testers, and                
              electrostatic plotter and other minor peripherals are being                    
              added to the existing laboratory.  This enhancement allows                     
              introduction of the state-of-the-art computer-aided-design                     
              practices into the curriculum of the VLSI System Engineering                   
              minor.  This minor is the first such program in the nation, and                
              emphasizes the systems approach to large-scale hardware design                 
              and development, and the use of computer-aided-design, analysis                
              and test tools for rapid-prototyping and evaluation of designs.
