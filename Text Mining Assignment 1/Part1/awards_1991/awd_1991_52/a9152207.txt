Abstract    :
              The biochemistry program is being updated and expanded to keep                 
              abreast of the ACS program developments and new techniques                     
              associated with biotechnology.  Specific changes in our program                
              include:  (1) expansion of the biochemistry course from one to                 
              two semesters, including laboratories;  (2) introduction of new                
              experiments involving chemical and molecular biological                        
              instrumentation including new emphasis on biochemical                          
              spectroscopy;  (3) early entry into undergraduate research;                    
              and (4) introduction of a biotechnology lecture and laboratory                 
              course involving hands-on experience with gene recombination                   
              procedures.  Biochemical equipment acquisitions include                        
              centrifuges, electrophoresis equipment, and microbiological                    
              equipment.  The grantee will overmatch the NSF award from non-                 
              Federal sources.
