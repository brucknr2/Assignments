Abstract    :
              The primary goal of this project is to broaden opportunities                   
              for student research in the following related fields of solid                  
              state physics: the optical properties of metals, electronic                    
              transport through tunnel barriers and the characterization of                  
              interface morphology.  In particular, the phenomenon of light                  
              emission from tunnel junctions is a suitable topic for                         
              undergraduate projects.  The acquisition of a monochromator, a                 
              rotating sample holder and a calibrated light source allow the                 
              spectra of the emitted light to be measured.  In addition,                     
              students may compare their measured spectra with those                         
              calculated using models for the electron tunnelling current and                
              the microscopic features of the interfaces.
