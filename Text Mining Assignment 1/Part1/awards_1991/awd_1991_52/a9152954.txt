Abstract    :
              This project aims to equip an archaeology laboratory for                       
              undergraduate teaching at Carleton College. 50 students will                   
              use this laboratory  each year, in two archaeology classes, in                 
              conjunction with field programs, and for independent student                   
              research in association with a new interdisciplinary                           
              archaeology program.  A space for the laboratory has already                   
              been approved and many pieces of equipment either have been                    
              donated to the laboratory or can be borrowed from existing                     
              programs at Carleton.  The major equipment requested in this                   
              grant include the materials necessary to build two artificial                  
              archaeological sites in the lab and the computer equipment and                 
              software needed by students to analyze archaeological materials                
              and sites.  By using the modern computer-assisted-design (CAD)                 
              capabilities of the computer and its accessories, as well as                   
              other software, students can integrate all facets of practical                 
              archaeology, from curating and drawing artifacts, to generating                
              site plans, topographic maps, and sections, to interpreting                    
              patterns of ancient settlements.  There are no comparable                      
              facilities on the Carleton campus for these purposes.
