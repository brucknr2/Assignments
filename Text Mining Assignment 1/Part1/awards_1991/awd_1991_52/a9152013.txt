Abstract    :
              Physics teaching is being improved by focusing laboratory                      
              activities on exploring and applying fundamental concepts                      
              rather than verifying known results, and by improving the                      
              quality and increasing the quantity and variety of data                        
              collected.  High quality graphical representations of data are                 
              being used; more powerful analytical and computational tools                   
              are being employed; and appropriate topics in the curriculum                   
              are being covered through experiments, numerical analysis and                  
              simulation.  Students are being involved in the solution of                    
              more realistic problems and being provided with resources to do                
              so.To achieve these goals, the physics department is acquiring                 
              80386 based computers, VGA monitors, general purpose and motion                
              sensing interfaces and sensors, and a file server, and is                      
              equipping and networking a number of data acquisition stations.                
              Faculty are computerizing a number of current experiments and                  
              exploring others for possible computerization. The project is                  
              impacting initially all the freshmen and sophomore courses for                 
              both physical and life science majors, and will expand                         
              subsequently to all the students served by the department.NSF                  
              grant funds are being matched with funds from non-federal                      
              sources.
