Abstract    :
              The aim of this project is to strengthen the Experimental                      
              component of the Psychology curriculum through development of                  
              a computer-based Experimental Psychology laboratory.  Students                 
              in the laboratory will learn the concepts of Experimental                      
              Psychology while becoming familiar with the computer hardware,                 
              software and related peripherals.  They will become acquainted                 
              with the modern data acquisition, transmission, analysis and                   
              stimulus control techniques they are likely to encounter in                    
              graduate school and in the work place.  Actual experimentation                 
              will replace demonstrations and simulations, and student-                      
              initiated research will replace prepackaged laboratory                         
              activities.To achieve this goal, fifteen (15) IBM PS/2 Model                   
              55SX machines are net-worked with an IBM Model 80 file server.                 
              Work stations are interfaced using a Keithley 575 system with                  
              various response acquisition and stimulus generation devices.                  
              Two-way audio and one-way video communication are also provided                
              to and among stations to allow "live" behavioral interaction                   
              and analysis.
