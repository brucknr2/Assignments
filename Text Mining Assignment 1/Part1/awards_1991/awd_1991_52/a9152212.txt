Abstract    :
              The teaching of mathematics for undergraduate minority women,                  
              particularly those majoring in the sciences, is being enhanced                 
              by the use of computers (IBM PS/2) and software (Mathematica)                  
              that allows students to experiment and explore concepts.  A                    
              laboratory is equipped to provide the capability for                           
              interactive teaching and a classroom is equipped with a faculty                
              workstation and projection system.  Courses in linear algebra,                 
              calculus, probability and statistics are being taught using                    
              these facilities.
