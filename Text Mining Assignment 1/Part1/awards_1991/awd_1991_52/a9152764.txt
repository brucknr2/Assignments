Abstract    :
              The Computer Science and Engineering Department of the                         
              University of Nebraska-Lincoln offers a two-semester course                    
              sequence to prepare students to meet the growing cross-                        
              disciplinary need for scientists and engineers in computer                     
              vision.  A new laboratory program is being developed to                        
              significantly contribute to the instruction of these courses.                  
              A sequence of laboratory exercises provides hands-on experience                
              with practical image processing and computer vision problems.                  
              An original feature of this laboratory program is that students                
              select one of several application tracks tailored to their                     
              field of interest, thus providing students from different                      
              disciplines the opportunity for practical experience in their                  
              area of study.  The current laboratory equipment is being                      
              augmented with five computer workstations for acquiring,                       
              processing, and displaying images.
