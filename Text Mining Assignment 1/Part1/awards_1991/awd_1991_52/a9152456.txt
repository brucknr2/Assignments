Abstract    :
              This project provides two image analysis stations in order to                  
              enhance all engineering laboratory classes.  Each station will                 
              be equipped with a CCD video camera, a 13-inch video monitor                   
              and an 80386 processor-based microcomputer with a frame grabber                
              card and a super VGA monitor.  The stations add additional                     
              dimensions to laboratory experiments in civil, mechanical,                     
              chemical and electrical engineering classes through the instant                
              analysis of images.  Image analysis is used with experiments to                
              determine such things as sieve analysis of fine and coarse                     
              aggregates, percent of solids in activated sludge, and true                    
              stress curves in tensile tests.  Image analysis is further used                
              in studies utilizing the metallurgical microscope, in counting                 
              the droplets in air, and in determining Poisson's Ratio during                 
              tensile testing.
