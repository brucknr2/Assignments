Abstract    :
              Astronomical imaging can provide excellent opportunities for                   
              undergraduate students to explore the science of astronomy, the                
              process of scientific investigation, and the technology of                     
              imaging and image processing.  Students are using a CCD camera                 
              attached to Grinnell's 0.61 m telescope to carry out a wide                    
              variety of observational programs and processing the resulting                 
              images on the observatory's Sun workstation using IRAF and                     
              other image processing software.  Projects involve the study of                
              relatively faint objects (galaxies, nebulae, and star clusters)                
              and emphasize the extraction of physical information from the                  
              images through, for example, the use of filters during the                     
              exposures, and computer analysis of the resulting images.  This                
              instrumentation is used most heavily by physics majors who are                 
              doing one or two-semester independent study projects, but is                   
              also used in the general astronomy and advanced laboratory                     
              courses.  The acquisition of a CCD camera system completes the                 
              process of development of image acquisition and analysis                       
              capability at Grinnell's observatory that has taken place over                 
              the past several years.
