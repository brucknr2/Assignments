Abstract    :
              This project is improving both quantitatively and qualitatively                
              the nuclear physics laboratory and to a lesser extent, the                     
              nonlinear and optics experiments, at California State                          
              Polytechnic University-Pomona.  The quantitative aspect of the                 
              improvement is needed due to the increase in the number of                     
              physics majors at the University.  The qualitative aspect                      
              involves using computers to interface with equipment, which                    
              will allow faculty to add novel experiments to the existing                    
              program.  Computers also are being used by students for                        
              numerical simulations of nonlinear phenomena.NSF funds are                     
              being matched with funds from non-federal sources.
