Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry is  acquiring rheometry equipment                  
              for the development of the undergraduate polymer science                       
              laboratory courses. Students in the polymer science course are                 
              using the equipment to measure the influence of antioxidants in                
              the cross-linking of rubber and flow activation parameters in                  
              polyethylenes. The equipment is being used in numerous                         
              undergraduate research projects including the characterization                 
              of poly(arylene ether)s and the degradation of vinylidene                      
              chloride oligomers.
