Abstract    :
              This project, an undergraduate structural engineering                          
              laboratory, enhances the understanding of structural                           
              engineering principles through experiments; introduces current                 
              technology in sensors, data acquisition, and the use of                        
              computers with instrumentation; introduces nondestructive                      
              testing methods for structures; and improves planning and                      
              technical writing abilities.  The equipment includes force and                 
              reaction hardware for benchtop structural engineering                          
              experiments; a variety of sensors for static and dynamic                       
              performance characterization experiments;  data-acquisition                    
              hardware and computers for experiments using computer-based                    
              data acquisition systems; and nondestructive testing equipment                 
              for experiments and demonstrations on steel and concrete                       
              structures.
