Abstract    :
              The Grambling State University computer Literacy Center is                     
              being developed to establish an environment to foster the                      
              acquisition of computer skills required in our technological                   
              society.  The center consists of twenty-five personal computers                
              without a hard disk connected over a local area network to a                   
              file server.  Having all software including the operating                      
              systems, spread sheets, word processors, and BASIC interpreter                 
              centrally located simplifies software maintenance and enhances                 
              system integrity.  The center also contains eight personal                     
              computers with additional memory and a hard disk for more                      
              advanced applications.  The establishment of the literacy                      
              laboratory allows the introduction of computing concepts with                  
              hands-on experience to all undergraduate students except those                 
              majoring in mathematics and computer science.
