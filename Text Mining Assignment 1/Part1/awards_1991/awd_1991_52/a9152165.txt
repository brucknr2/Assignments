Abstract    :
                The Department of Chemistry is purchasing a GC/MS to give                    
              undergraduates hands-on experience with electron-impact and                    
              chemical ionization mass spectrometry in combination with gas                  
              chromatography in several upper division courses. The principal                
              applications of the system are the identification of unknown                   
              compounds, both singly and in mixtures, quantitative analysis,                 
              exploration of reaction mechanisms, and the study of ion-                      
              molecule reactions. The instrument is also being used in                       
              undergraduate chemical research.
