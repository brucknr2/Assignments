Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to improve an introductory course,                 
              Concepts in the Biomedical Sciences, and thus provide an                       
              enriched experience for the several hundred non-science majors                 
              at this state teachers college who normally enroll in the                      
              course to meet their teacher education and general education                   
              requirements.  The MacIntosh computers, printer, and software,                 
              and videomicroscopy equipment acquired allow the instructors to                
              communicate concepts and tasks more effectively, increase                      
              hands-on experience for the students, enhance the student's                    
              quantitative skills, and better prepare students for entry into                
              a human-focused, cell/molecular-based biology program.
