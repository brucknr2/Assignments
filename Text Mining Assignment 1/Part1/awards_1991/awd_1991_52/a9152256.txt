Abstract    :
              This project has the goal of improving the introductory physics                
              laboratory courses taken by scientists and engineers.  The                     
              physics department is replacing the computer-based data-                       
              acquisition and analysis equipment used in these courses so                    
              that students learn to use general purpose computer data-                      
              acquisition hardware, general purpose data-acquisition                         
              software, data analysis software based on a spreadsheet, and                   
              report preparation software as part of a first semester general                
              physics laboratory course.  Having acquired the ability to use                 
              these and other essential laboratory tools, students use these                 
              general purpose tools and work more independently in the second                
              semester laboratory course.  This two semester laboratory                      
              course sequence builds on student knowledge of computer                        
              hardware and software; it also prepares students for upper                     
              division laboratory courses and for research participation.                    
              The major software package used is LabVIEW, a graphic based                    
              language which allows students to easily program the computer                  
              interface to deal with each experimental problem.NSF grant                     
              funds are being matched with funds from non-federal sources.
