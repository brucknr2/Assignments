Abstract    :
              Courses in Organic Chemistry, Physical Chemistry, Advanced                     
              Inorganic Chemistry, Instrumental Analysis, and Modern Organic                 
              Analysis have been revised to include 60 MHz NMR experiments.                  
              This will complement the chemistry program policy of providing                 
              students with opportunities for "hands-on" experience with                     
              FTIR, UV-VIS, GC, GC/MS, HPLC, DSC, and other instruments.  The                
              number of viable projects in a recently developed undergraduate                
              research program will increase significantly.  Cooperation with                
              area universities has been established to provide access to                    
              high resolution FT-NMR.  The acquisition will advance major                    
              departmental goals of gaining ACS-CPT approval and attracting                  
              additional chemistry majors.  The grantee will match the NSF                   
              award from non-Federal sources.
