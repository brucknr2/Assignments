Abstract    :
              This project is improving the chemistry, physics, physical                     
              science, and mathematics curriculum at Central Alabama                         
              Community College through the development of an Open                           
              Science/Mathematics Computer Laboratory. The Open Laboratory                   
              expands the use of computers in mathematics and science classes                
              and laboratories using an integrated four level instructional                  
              approach. The four levels of instruction include: (1) computer                 
              simulation, (2) data analysis and graphing,(3) data                            
              acquisition, and (4) construction of a computer interface                      
              device. This stepped approach is allowing students to become                   
              familiar with one level of computer use before proceeding to                   
              the next, more difficult level of instruction. Interactive                     
              video discs/software and conventional software, previously used                
              as lecture demonstrations, are being used by individual                        
              students to enhance their laboratory experiences. Students are                 
              seeing how computer skills important in one subject area can be                
              applied to and overlap with other disciplines. Russell                         
              Corporation, a local manufacturer, is matching the NSF grant in                
              support of the project.
