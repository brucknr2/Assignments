Abstract    :
              This project is facilitating the development of major                          
              curriculum innovations in Computational Biology and                            
              Computational Chemistry for advanced undergraduates by                         
              providing training in the application of computational methods                 
              to experimental sciences. The purchase of computer workstations                
              with advanced graphics capability enable the teaching of                       
              molecular dynamics and modeling, the addition of a fluorescence                
              detector to an extant HPLC System allow expansion of the types                 
              of molecules that can be analyzed, and a computer-based                        
              digitizer and image processing system are used for the                         
              acquisition of DNA sequence data.
