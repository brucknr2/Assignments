Abstract    :
              Funds are sought to purchase the sound analysis programs known                 
              as SIGNAL and REAL TIME SPECTROGRAPH (RTS) and the event                       
              recording program known as OBSERVER and the computer equipment                 
              on which they can be run.  The purpose of this purchase is to                  
              help reinstitute courses successfully taught during the 1970's                 
              which offered undergraduates the opportunity to collect                        
              original observations on familiar bird species.  These courses                 
              taught the fundamental precepts of science as organized                        
              curiosity of focussing on the student's own perception of the                  
              birds and on research problems of the students' own devising.                  
              Students came to understand scientific methods not as arbitrary                
              constraints as a way of accomplishing goals of their own                       
              devising.  Since bird song is the most salient feature of bird                 
              behavior, these courses will be made much more effective if                    
              students have access to a simple, convenient device for the                    
              display and analysis of bird song.  Such a device will enable                  
              many students, particularly the more inventive and persistent,                 
              to develop and test hypotheses concerning the relationship of                  
              bird song to other behaviors that they are observing.
