Abstract    :
              We plan to improve our curriculum in biology by expanding and                  
              improving laboratory exercises in plant cell culture in our                    
              Botany and Introductory Biology courses, and by including them                 
              in a new course, Biotechnology in Theory and Practice.This                     
              year, we made a modest beginning in Botany by culturing African                
              violet leaf tissue, growing callus tissue from hypocotyls of                   
              sterile Brassica rapa seedlings, and making vacuole                            
              preparations from flower petal cells.  We are excited about the                
              outcome of the B. rapa exercise, and are developing additional                 
              plant culture exercises from it.  Students enjoyed working with                
              B. rapa because the seedlings and callus tissue grew so fast.                  
              They also enjoyed isolating the large, colorful vacuoles from                  
              flower petals.  The vacuoles gave them a new way to study the                  
              effects of hyper- and hypotonic solutions.Now we want to                       
              incorporate more sophisticated manipulations of plant cultures,                
              such as shoot culture and morphogenesis, and for that we will                  
              need the controlled light and temperature conditions provided                  
              by growth chambers.  We also need to maintain suspension                       
              cultures of plant cells for protoplast isolation, cloning of                   
              single cells, and nutrition. experiments, and for those we need                
              gyrotary shaker.
