Abstract    :
              The chemistry curriculum will be enhanced by introducing the                   
              theory and practice of Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)                       
              spectrophotometry in the organic chemistry course and two other                
              chemistry courses.  The instrument will give organic students                  
              hands-on experience with modern computer-controlled                            
              instrumentation and will reinforce the learning of chemical                    
              principles.  The instrument will also be introduced in the                     
              general chemistry course.  This acquisition will enable the                    
              department to offer, for the first time, an analytical                         
              chemistry course.  The FTIR will be integrated into this                       
              quantitative analysis laboratory.  The grantee will match the                  
              NSF award from non-Federal sources.
