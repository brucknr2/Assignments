Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is the development of an                              
              interdiscliplinary controls and robotics engineering laboratory                
              for undergraduate electrical and mechanical engineering majors,                
              based on an integrated computer network of automated data                      
              acquisition, analysis and control tools. Personal computers are                
              interfaced to analog computers for simulation and to actual                    
              hardware for control and automation of typical manufacturing                   
              operations and industrial processes. These personal computer                   
              workstations are networked to existing supercomputer                           
              capabilities. In addition, the student workstations are                        
              networked to an instructor's station to allow for real time                    
              student-instructor interaction. The laboratory allows expanded                 
              coverage of traditional controls topics and permits the                        
              introduction of appropriate advanced control techniques                        
              including adaptive control for machining operations.
