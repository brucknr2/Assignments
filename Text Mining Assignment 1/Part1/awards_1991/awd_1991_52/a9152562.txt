Abstract    :
              The Science Department is purchasing a FT-IR and gas                           
              chromatograph for use in the organic chemistry courses.                        
              Students in the new courses are gaining hands on experience                    
              with two of the basic spectroscopic, analytical, and sample                    
              manipulation tools available to chemists in the field of                       
              organic chemistry. Students are using Infrared Spectroscopy and                
              Gas Chromatography techniques to test for purity, identifiy the                
              product distribution, and characterization of compounds they                   
              have synthesized.
