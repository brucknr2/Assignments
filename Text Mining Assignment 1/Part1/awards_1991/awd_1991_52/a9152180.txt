Abstract    :
              A four-term undergraduate course sequence, with a focus on VLSI                
              design techniques, is being developed with laboratory exercises                
              to complement each course.  Standard cell techniques receive                   
              the major emphasis with other techniques also being stressed.                  
              IC fabrication (using MOSIS) of prototype ICs is being planned                 
              for incorporation in the laboratory  coursework.  Testability                  
              is introduced at an early stage of the sequence, and emphasized                
              through-out.  Equipment obtained includes five (5) Apollo                      
              workstations, using Mentor-Graphics software, plus eight (8)                   
              80386-based PCs using ORCAD.  The goal is for the students in                  
              the sequence to experience taking an IC design concept all the                 
              way through analysis, simulation, design, fabrication and                      
              testing.
