Abstract    :
              The establishment of a Computer Laboratory in the Geography                    
              Department at Mary Washington College is proposed. This                        
              laboratory will significantly enhance the 'instruction offered                 
              in several upper-level geography courses, as well as providing                 
              students with "hands-on" 'experience using equipment they 'will                
              encounter in graduate schools and professional careers.Specific                
              needs to be addressed include introducing geography majors to                  
              geographic information systems and the basics of automated                     
              mapping; acquiring imagery from orbiting weather satellites,                   
              and providing the means to demonstrate various computer                        
              applications and provide instruction on their use in classes of                
              up to forty students each.
