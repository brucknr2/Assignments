Abstract    :
              Clear, unambiguous, "real world" physics laboratory experiences                
              are crucial for the development of an appreciation and                         
              understanding of physics by the non-physics major.  Heidelberg                 
              College is addressing this need by developing laboratory                       
              experiences that utilize a "video system" (camcorder, jog and                  
              shuttle player, monitor and tripod).The equipment acquired with                
              this grant is being used to conduct experiments in the areas of                
              kinematics, dynamics, momentum, angular motion, and energy.                    
              These are areas which students have found difficult to                         
              visualize and understand.  The video equipment is providing                    
              students with tools to record the complex or short duration                    
              events common to these areas, and analyze the events step-by-                  
              step as the events progress in time.The power of the video                     
              system is that it aids students in observing and quantifying                   
              "real world" events that normally cannot be considered in the                  
              introductory laboratory because of size, spatial, and time                     
              limitations.  For non-physics majors, it is sometimes the first                
              time they discover that physics exists outside of the                          
              laboratory.NSF funds are being matched with funds from non-                    
              federal sources.
