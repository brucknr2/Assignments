Abstract    :
              Personal computers are being use in physics and astronomy                      
              courses to obtain data in real time, perform analysis, and                     
              construct models.  In the physics laboratories the data are                    
              used to illustrate and make extensive analysis of various                      
              phenomena.  In the elementary laboratories the focus is on                     
              analysis to enhance the skills of students and to provide hands                
              on experience with computers and modern data acquisition. In                   
              the advanced laboratories computers are being used, in addition                
              to the above, to provide more sophisticated analytical tools.                  
              In the astronomy laboratories available software is being used                 
              to help students visualize celestial motion, perform exercises                 
              using celestial coordinates, and provide background for                        
              observation sessions.NSF grant funds are being matched with                    
              funds from non-federal sources.
