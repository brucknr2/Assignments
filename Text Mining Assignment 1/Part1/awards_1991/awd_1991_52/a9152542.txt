Abstract    :
              A gradient High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system                
              with a multiple wavelength detector and a fraction collector                   
              will improve the undergraduate curriculum in chemistry.                        
              Instruction of chemistry, biology, and natural science majors                  
              will stress fundamentals of chromatography and the uses of HPLC                
              for qualitative and quantitative analysis of thermally labile                  
              compounds, and for separation and purification.  HPLC methods                  
              will be taught in Biochemistry, Instrumental Analysis, Organic                 
              Chemistry, Independent Study (undergraduate research), and                     
              Honors Thesis projects.  The grantee will match the NSF award                  
              from non-Federal sources.
