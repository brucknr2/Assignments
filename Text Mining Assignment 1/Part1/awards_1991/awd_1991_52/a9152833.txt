Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry is purchasing a Fourier transform                  
              infrared (FTIR) spectrometer, a computer workstation, and                      
              accessories for use in upper division courses.  The  instrument                
              is being used in number of new investigations in the areas of                  
              kinetics, photochemistry, and the quantitative analysis of                     
              hydrocarbon mixtures related to gasoline and associated                        
              products. Other applications include study of equilibrium                      
              values for H-D exchange reactions on solid catalyst surfaces.
