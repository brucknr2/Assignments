Abstract    :
              This project provides an integrated PC-VAX environment which                   
              will be used: 1) to implement an innovative Systems Analysis                   
              and Design course; 2) to make innovations in teaching                          
              Comparative Programming Languages; 3) to enhance the computer                  
              lab experience available to all the other computer science                     
              courses; and 4) to update and expand access to computing for                   
              improvement of the other science and math courses.  The                        
              equipment consists of a VAX 3300, ten IBM-AT compatible                        
              microcomputers, four MAC SE computers, assorted network                        
              hardware, and software for networking and for programming.                     
              This configuration prepares students for the kind of computing                 
              environments found among employers who are using distributed                   
              processing systems with centralized data bases.  In addition,                  
              the access to computing facilities will be vastly improved for                 
              all Navajo students attending this Tribal College on the Navajo                
              Reservation.
