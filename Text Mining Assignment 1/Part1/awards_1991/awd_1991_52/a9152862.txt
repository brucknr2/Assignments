Abstract    :
              This project improves instruction through use of modern                        
              instrumentation in upper- and lower-level chemistry courses.                   
              Experiments will be developed for use of an atomic absorption                  
              spectrometer in the analytical, advanced analytical, and                       
              general chemistry courses.  These will further develop the                     
              current emphasis on environmental chemistry in the sophomore-                  
              level analytical course.  The project will also strengthen                     
              student/faculty research in chemistry and in geology.  Three                   
              research projects will be significantly enhanced.  The grantee                 
              will match the NSF award from non-Federal funds.
