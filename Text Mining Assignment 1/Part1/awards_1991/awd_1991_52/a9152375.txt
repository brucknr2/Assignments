Abstract    :
              This project develops a digital signal processing laboratory to                
              support three courses within the Electrical Engineering                        
              Department at the Rochester Institute of Technology.  The                      
              proposed laboratory consists of a MacIntosh IIci host computer                 
              connected to a Motorola DSP56000 signal processing computer.                   
              The combination provides a system which is useful in                           
              demonstrating principles and techniques of real time digital                   
              signal processing. Two of the three courses are required                       
              courses within the EE program.  In these two courses, the                      
              laboratory is used mainly to permit the students to develop                    
              software and hardware to demonstrate DSP techniques and                        
              principles.  They are expected to simulate DSP using the C                     
              programming language and using MatLab.  The third supported                    
              course is an elective course and this laboratory permits                       
              students to design, test, and demonstrate real-time digital                    
              signal processing techniques and make full use of the Motorola                 
              DSP56000 computer.
