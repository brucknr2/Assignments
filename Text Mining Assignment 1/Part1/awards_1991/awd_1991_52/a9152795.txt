Abstract    :
              The Monochromator system is being used to introduce Smith                      
              College undergraduate physics students to an important area of                 
              contemporary experimental physics currently underrepresented in                
              the curriculum.   In laboratory work in introductory and                       
              intermediate courses, it provides an opportunity to make high                  
              precision measurements as well as exposure to basic quantum                    
              phenomena.   The students, all women, especially need                          
              experience with high quality modern instruments to enhance                     
              their experimental skills and encourage them to consider                       
              experimental rather than theoretical physics as a career.                      
              This equipment also provides an opportunity for senior theses                  
              on fundamental topics; the high-quality equipment makes                        
              possible interesting and significant experiments.
