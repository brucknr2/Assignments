Abstract    :
              The Chemical Engineering Department is expanding its curriculum                
              so that it exposes students to practical and theoretical                       
              applications in the area of Waste Management by developing a                   
              Waste Management Technologies Laboratory.  Students apply                      
              principles discussed in current technical electives in the area                
              of waste technologies through the hands on operation of a                      
              bioremediation system, a particulate characterization and                      
              removal system and an incineration system.  A workstation is                   
              used for sophisticated modeling, simulation and graphics                       
              ability.  Experiments and examples illustrating principles of                  
              these emerging technologies are also incorporated into existing                
              core courses.
