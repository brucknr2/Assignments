Abstract    :
              This project expands the existing undergraduate research                       
              program for Computer Science majors, and enhances certain                      
              advanced elective courses which prepare students to do                         
              research.  These courses are Computer Vision, Neural Networks,                 
              Graphics, and Artificial Intelligence.  Some of the students                   
              taking these courses have been motivated to continue with                      
              independent research projects, with at least three being                       
              supported by REU grants.  In addition, all seniors are required                
              to complete a senior research project, and a number of students                
              have presented papers on their research in national and                        
              regional conferences.  The addition of three Sun workstations                  
              and a scanner, together with the supporting software, will                     
              broaden the scope of projects that students can undertake, and                 
              also provide facilities for more undergraduates to participate                 
              in research projects.
