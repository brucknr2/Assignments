Abstract    :
              The Department is purchasing a 4.5 meter radio antenna and                     
              motors, to be used in an instructional radio telescope.                        
              Electronics and test equipment from a recently decommissioned                  
              radio telescope are being used to complete the system.  The                    
              telescope is capable of a wide variety of radiometric and                      
              spectrometric observations.  Projects include measurements of                  
              the flux density and spectra of extragalactic radio sources and                
              galactic H II regions, observations of neutral hydrogen in the                 
              galaxy, and study of the effects of the atmosphere on radio                    
              wave propagation.  This instrument benefits the education of a                 
              wide variety of undergraduate students.  It is used as a                       
              demonstration device in a large introductory course for                        
              nonscience students.  Students in the freshman course for                      
              physics and astronomy majors use the telescope in several                      
              laboratory experiments.  Finally, the radio telescope is the                   
              centerpiece of a laboratory for upper level undergraduate and                  
              graduate students in astronomy, physics, and engineering.  In                  
              this course students are taught the rudiments of                               
              instrumentation in radio astronomy and radiophysics.
