Abstract    :
              A laboratory for the development of computer interfaces is                     
              being established to educate undergraduate computer science                    
              majors in the design and experimental evaluation of human-                     
              computer interfaces.  The lab supports a new course in human-                  
              computer interface (HCI), covering topics that include HCI                     
              modelling, experimental evaluation of various forms of                         
              interfaces, tools for interface development and management, and                
              rapid prototyping.  A variety of computer models are used in                   
              the laboratory, including NeXT, SUN, DEC, APPLE, and IBM.                      
              Students design, develop, and implement prototype interfaces,                  
              and then experimentally evaluate their effectiveness.
