Abstract    :
              Incorporation of a 200 MHz C/H NMR spectrometer will upgrade                   
              the curriculum by allowing our students to experience powerful                 
              means of structure elucidation, and it will introduce computer-                
              controlled instrumentation.  The project will strengthen the                   
              curriculum at several levels.  The second-year organic                         
              chemistry sequence will be augmented to allow earlier and more                 
              frequent use of NMR in compound identification and structure                   
              analysis.  The course "Introduction to NMR", part of our                       
              research introduction sequence "Advanced Opportunities in                      
              Chemistry", will be expanded to give more students early                       
              technical skills and encouragement to pursue later                             
              undergraduate research.  Upper level courses will use FT-NMR as                
              an integral part of the problem-solving.  The undergraduate                    
              research program will be emphasized and greatly strengthened by                
              the acquisition.  The grantee will match the NSF award from                    
              non-Federal sources.
