Abstract    :
              This project models a computer-integrated manufacturing system                 
              around a typical business environment.  The laboratory                         
              integrates a plurality of disciplines from secretarial science,                
              business administration, electronics, mechanical design, and                   
              manufacturing. The laboratory provides an environment where all                
              areas of technology are able to experience the actual problems                 
              involved in bringing a new product into successful                             
              manufacturing.  The equipment provides the manufacturing                       
              terminus to the system.  Secretarial science students perform                  
              document design, order entry, and customer interface.                          
              Electronics students are involved in design, installation, and                 
              maintenance of the network subsystem.  Mechanical design                       
              students design both the basic product and the individual                      
              unique parts of each order.  Manufacturing students  perform                   
              the actual mechanical manufacturing, and business students                     
              perform the project administration and financial control.
