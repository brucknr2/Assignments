Abstract    :
              Computer-assisted videodisc technology will be used in the                     
              general chemistry course to incorporate the "Exploring                         
              Chemistry" software.  The primary purpose is to serve the                      
              expository and laboratory needs of impaired or disabled                        
              students.  It will focus secondarily on the needs of                           
              international students and those from non-Western ethnic                       
              backgrounds who have difficulty with scientific language.  The                 
              hardware needed for the learning laboratory of this prototype                  
              project includes three microcomputers and networking software.                 
              A three-year department plan has been established for this                     
              project, with implementation and evaluation of the course plan                 
              to take about two years.  The methods will be extended to the                  
              whole course and disseminated as appropriate.  The grantee will                
              match the NSF award from non-Federal sources.
