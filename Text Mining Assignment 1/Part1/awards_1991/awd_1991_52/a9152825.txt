Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is give freshman biology majors                       
              opportunities to apply analytical methods to data analysis,                    
              hypothesis testing, and prediction in a course emphasizing                     
              physiological adaptation.  MacIntosh computers, temperature                    
              measuring equipment, analytical balances, and treadmills and                   
              wet spirometers will be used in innovative experiments                         
              involving vertebrates and invertebrates to help students learn                 
              to evaluate experimental results, expect the unexpected, and                   
              become active participants in experimental biology at an early                 
              stage in their careers.
