Abstract    :
              The aim of this project is to provide the undergraduate                        
              students in mechanical engineering the highest quality                         
              laboratory experience by exposing them to the latest in non-                   
              contact laser transducer technology.  This will be accomplished                
              by the acquisition of a laser vibrometer (LV) system for use in                
              the existing vibrations laboratory.  This will directly support                
              the undergraduate engineering vibrations and laser engineering                 
              courses, as well as being used by undergraduate students in                    
              various design projects and other laboratories.
