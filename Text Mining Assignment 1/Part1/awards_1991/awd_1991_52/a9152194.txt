Abstract    :
              This project establishs a digital system design laboratory for                 
              undergraduate electrical engineering students at the FAMU/FSU                  
              College of Engineering.  This laboratory provides a unique                     
              "hands-on" experience for junior and senior level                              
              undergraduates through student projects which cover a variety                  
              of engineering fundamentals, ranging from the design and                       
              analysis of electronic and logic circuits, to their                            
              implementation using full and semi custom integrated circuit                   
              (IC) design techniques (i.e. MOSIS) or through the use of user-                
              programmable application-specified integrated circuits (ASICs)                 
              such as programmable-logic-devices (PLDs) and field-                           
              programmable-gate-arrays (FPGAs).  The emphasis of the program                 
              is to teach undergraduate students the computer-aided-design                   
              (CAD) methodologies of very-large-scale integration (VLSI)                     
              design utilizing low-cost high-performance personal computers                  
              and state-of-the-art CAD software design and analysis
