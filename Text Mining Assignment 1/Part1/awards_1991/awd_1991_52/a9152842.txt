Abstract    :
              Two computer laboratories are being used to support mathematics                
              instruction by implementing a wide variety of computer tools                   
              designed to make mathematics learning more of a "hands on"                     
              exploration of mathematics, much like a natural science laboratory.            
              While Mathematica will be one of the tools employed, it will be                
              used primarily as a calculation engine designed to serve other,                
              more course specific computer tools developed by the faculty and               
              tailored to the needs of the students. The NeXTSTEP development                
              environment is used to create computer-based
