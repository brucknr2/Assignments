Abstract    :
              Holy Cross has recently established a Psychobiology/                           
              Neuroscience concentration.  The goal of this program is to                    
              provide a structured approach towards studying brain (nervous                  
              system and behavior relationships).  The current proposal asks                 
              for equipment to establish a Neuroscience Lab course that would                
              focus on teaching neuroanatomy and cell physiology.  In                        
              addition to the Neuroscience course, this equipment would be                   
              used by students in research projects and would integrate into                 
              a number of related courses and labs in both the Biology and                   
              Psychology Departments.
