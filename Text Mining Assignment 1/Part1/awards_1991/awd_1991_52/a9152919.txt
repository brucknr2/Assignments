Abstract    :
              In order to integrate manufacturing-related courses into                       
              mechanical engineering, a comprehensive curriculum                             
              restructuring and laboratory development plan has been                         
              generated.  A crucial element of this plan is establishing an                  
              Advanced Manufacturing Laboratory, consisting of a turn-key GEM                
              cell, a SCARA robot, a machine vision system, and four CNC                     
              machines.
