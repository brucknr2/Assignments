Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry at Rensselaer Polytechnic                          
              Institute, in collaboration with the Department of Materials                   
              Engineering, is equipping a laboratory for a freshman chemistry                
              course that emphasizes materials chemistry. This innovative                    
              course uses materials-oriented laboratory experiments that are                 
              relevant to the 'real world' and show the beauty, the                          
              complexity, and the discovery aspect of science.                               
              The grantee is matching this award from non-Federal sources.
