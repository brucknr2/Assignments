Abstract    :
              The project's goal is to provide a networked engineering                       
              laboratory with unique computer-aided instruction (CAI) and CAD                
              capability.  The laboratory is expected to transform a                         
              traditional two-dimensional paper and pencil instructional                     
              environment to an integrated three-dimensional dynamic                         
              computer-aided instructional and design environment for                        
              teaching of the combination of traditional engineering graphics                
              instruction enhanced by computer-aided instruction and                         
              visualization and three-dimensional computer-aided design and                  
              drafting (CADD), in addition to computer-aided logistics (CALS)                
              techniques.  The laboratory also provides students and faculty                 
              with the tools to implement 3D CADD and solid modeling-based                   
              visualization techniques in an advanced, modern integrated                     
              engineering design graphics (EDG) curriculum.
