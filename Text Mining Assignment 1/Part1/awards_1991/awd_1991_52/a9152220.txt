Abstract    :
              Chemistry Department is purchasing two double beam recording                   
              spectrophotometers for use in several upper division courses.                  
              Students in biochemistry are using the instruments to study the                
              effects of varying the reaction conditions of the rates of                     
              enzymatic reactions and in characterization of DNA                             
              preparations. The spectrophotometers are also being used to                    
              analyze hydrocarbon mixtures in advanced instrumental analysis                 
              laboratories. Additionally, undergraduate research participants                
              are making extensive use of the instruments in their                           
              investigations.
