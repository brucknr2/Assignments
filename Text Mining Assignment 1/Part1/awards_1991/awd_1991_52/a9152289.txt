Abstract    :
              This project is expanding the instructional equipment                          
              associated with an intermediate optics laboratory for junior                   
              and senior physics majors at Pennsylvania State University. New                
              experiments are being introduced that employ modern optical                    
              tools for quantitative measurement, replacing a number of the                  
              more traditional experiments which have relied on visual                       
              observation of interference/diffraction patterns. For the most                 
              part, the experiments apply multichannel detection to perform                  
              unique experiments in polarimetry and spectroscopy, with the                   
              intent to demonstrate the fundamental principles of optics and                 
              to convey the excitement of research at the forefront of                       
              optical physics. The principles and concepts demonstrated in                   
              the laboratory include the interaction of light with matter:                   
              the Fresnel equations, reflectance, transmittance, dispersion,                 
              absorption, dieletric functions, birefringence, optical                        
              activity, thin film interference, multilayer films, and                        
              diffraction gratings. The laboratories are teaching one- and                   
              two-dimensional Fourier analysis, coordinate transformations,                  
              matrix manipulations, Jones and Stokes vector treatments of                    
              polarized light, and Muller and Jones matrix representation of                 
              optical elements, including polarizers and retarders.  This                    
              complements selected traditional experiments which are retained                
              in interference and diffraction.NSF grant funds are being                      
              matched with funds from non-federal sources.
