Abstract    :
              Physical chemistry students will be introduced to atomic and                   
              molecular spectroscopy through a series of experiments                         
              involving rotational, vibrational, and electronic transitions.                 
              The major components of the requested equipment are an FTIR                    
              spectrophotometer with resolution of 0.5 wavenumbers sufficient                
              for gas-phase rotation-vibration spectroscopy, and a laser-                    
              Raman or laser-fluorescence set up for Raman spectroscopy and                  
              spectroscopy of iodine.  Laser-fluorescence experiments will                   
              also be performed in the Advanced Analytical lab course to                     
              teach students the analytical uses of fluorimetry.  The grantee                
              will overmatch the NSF award from non-Federal sources.
