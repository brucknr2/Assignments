Abstract    :
              Mankato State University's (MSU) Department of Biological                      
              Sciences includes quantitative training of undergraduates to                   
              develop skills necessary for biologists and environmental                      
              scientists in the next decade.  A Hewlett Packard gas                          
              chromatograph (GC) and high performance liquid chromatography                  
              system (HPLC) are to be purchased to facilitate instruction in                 
              Biology programs, including Environmental Sciences, Toxicology,                
              and Microbiology, as well as encourage development of more                     
              interdisciplinary undergraduate courses and projects at MSU.                   
              The GC and HPLC are essential tools for the detection and                      
              quantification organic chemicals in a variety of matrices.                     
              Laboratory exercises and class projects have been designed in                  
              seven courses to instruct students in the theory, advantages,                  
              limitations, and proper use of each instrument.  Course                        
              projects will involve use of these instruments to determine                    
              anthropogenic organic compounds in water, soil/sediments,                      
              biological fluids/tissues and air. Instrumental uses will                      
              include measurement of the accumulation of organic compounds in                
              organisms and associated biomarker enzyme levels, natural                      
              products and the transformation of pesticides. Undergraduate                   
              students will also have access to these instruments for their                  
              independent study research projects.
