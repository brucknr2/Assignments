Abstract    :
              The current CAD laboratory is upgraded to include a network of                 
              computer workstations which support solids modeling and                        
              analysis software.  Students in the mechanical engineering                     
              technology and manufacturing and design technology programs                    
              study the concepts and techniques of interactive solids                        
              modeling.  Utilizing the solids software students complete                     
              assignments that include solid renderings and the support                      
              calculations of the mechanical properties of their designs.                    
              Also, software related to finite element analysis,                             
              manufacturing systems, machining centers, and HVAC design is                   
              used to support the design and analysis components of the                      
              curriculum.
