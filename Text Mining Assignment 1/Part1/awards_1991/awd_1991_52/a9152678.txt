Abstract    :
              Although lasers have revolutionized many areas of experimental                 
              physical chemistry, the undergraduate physical chemistry                       
              laboratory is essentially unchanged.  This project introduces                  
              lasers and laser spectroscopy to the undergraduate physical                    
              chemistry laboratory.  Flexible equipment including an argon                   
              ion pumped dye laser and a spectrometer for the undergraduate                  
              physical chemistry laboratory will make possible a Raman                       
              experiment, a laser induced fluorescence experiment, a laser-                  
              excitation/molecular absorption experiment, and a laser                        
              refractometry experiment.  These experiments have been                         
              described by various authors.  Other laser spectroscopy                        
              experiments may be developed and incorporated into the                         
              curriculum.  The grantee will match the NSF contribution to                    
              this project from non-Federal sources.
