Abstract    :
              The Boston University Solar Telescope has been used for over                   
              ten years to allow students to observe sunspots, flares, and                   
              high-resolution optical spectra of the sun.  New technology                    
              allows the renovation of this telescope with CCD detectors and                 
              cameras, a new optical bench and driving motor, and personal-                  
              computer based driving, recording, and plotting system.  With                  
              a refurbished telescope, students can make, record, and take                   
              away hard copies of observations of sunspots, chromospheric                    
              emission, flares, and spectra.  The spectral resolution is high                
              enough to see first-hand the doppler shifts of the Fraunhofer                  
              lines, at the eastern and western limbs, relative to reference                 
              lines arising in Earth's atmosphere.  Measurements of the                      
              doppler shifts plus angular motions of sunspots allow students                 
              to measure the distance to the Sun.  Observations of the phases                
              and angular size changes of Venus with the telescope (which can                
              be done in the daytime since Venus is so bright) then allow a                  
              determination of the size of its orbit as well.  Setting the                   
              spectral resolution to a lower level allows first-hand                         
              spectroscopy of stars, planets, and the moon.
