Abstract    :
              This Communications Laboratory improvement project upgrades                    
              current facilities by incorporating real-time simulation of                    
              communications systems and networks.  The real-time end to end                 
              simulation capability provides students with the hardware and                  
              software tools necessary to support subsystem level design                     
              (e.g., channel equalization digital filters); additionally,                    
              system performance evaluation (e g., bit error rate                            
              measurement) may be accomplished via a protocol analyzer in                    
              conjunction with workstation interaction.  The simulation                      
              capability allows evaluation of designs at baseband and RF/IF                  
              frequencies.  Complete student team projects include data                      
              generation (e.g., source coding), transmission modulation                      
              selection/channel coding, and demodulation.  Students gain the                 
              theoretical knowledge and hands-on laboratory experience to                    
              enter the technology work force in the communications industry                 
              as a systems engineer and/or a network analyst.
