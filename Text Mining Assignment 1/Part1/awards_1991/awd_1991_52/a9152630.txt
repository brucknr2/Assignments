Abstract    :
              Industrial applications of digital and computer controlled                     
              small, large and fractional horsepower electronic motors have                  
              dramatically increased in the past decade.  Therefore, the need                
              for well-trained technicians to implement and maintain these                   
              high tech motor schemes is increasing dramatically.  This                      
              project will enable John Tyler Community College to purchase                   
              the laboratory equipment necessary to implement successful                     
              training in industrial digital and computer control of motors,                 
              the work horses of modern industry.  The equipment requested                   
              provides the students with a firm foundation in AC and DC motor                
              theory, operating characteristics, and control theory.                         
              Training in power semiconductor control builds on this                         
              foundation.  Modules equip the students with computer control                  
              experience using programmable logic controllers and direct                     
              digital computer control.  This educational opportunity will                   
              enable graduates from the Electronics and Instrumentation                      
              programs to make a significant contribution to the industrial                  
              community.
