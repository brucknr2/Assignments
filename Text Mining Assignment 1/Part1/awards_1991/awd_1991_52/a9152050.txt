Abstract    :
              This project will give undergraduate students in the field of                  
              communicative disorders an opportunity for hands-on experience                 
              with the most modern scientific equipment used in the                          
              investigation of normal and disordered speech production The                   
              acquisition of the following equipment allows the project to                   
              achieve this goal: the MacSpeech Lab II allows analysis of the                 
              complex acoustic information in speech, clarifying the speech                  
              production and perception theories presented in lectures.                      
              Linearized magnetometers provide the students with information                 
              concerning the coordinated movements of the respiratory system.                
              A pneumotachograph setup allows measurements of airflow                        
              patterns within the vocal tract, and when combined with input                  
              from an electroglottograph, yields valuable information about                  
              the activity of the vocal folds during voicing. Laboratory                     
              courses accompanying each of the undergraduate speech science                  
              lecture sections will employ the new equipment both in                         
              demonstrations and in student experiments.  By bringing                        
              students into a scientific environment where they become active                
              participants, this project opens the door to a greater                         
              appreciation for the role of science in the service of                         
              individuals with communicative disorders.
