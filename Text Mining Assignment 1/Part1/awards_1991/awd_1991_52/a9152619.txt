Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to expand and enhance the                          
              curriculum in animal physiology by (1) creating a new                          
              laboratory course in Neurobiology, (2) modernizing and                         
              expanding the exercises in an existing course, Laboratory in                   
              Physiology, and (3) enhancing exercises and demonstrations in                  
              Contemporary Issues in Biology, a large introductory course for                
              non-science majors.  The purchase of computerized data                         
              acquisition systems and software as well as scientific                         
              instruments used for neurobiological and physiological                         
              techniques, such as transducers, electrodes, stimulators,                      
              amplifiers, micromanipulators, fiber optic illuminators, and a                 
              microelectrode puller, provides students with hands-on, working                
              knowledge of current methods used in neurobiological research.                 
              Examples include: (1) intracellular and extracellular                          
              electrophysiological recording techniques; (2) neuroanatomical                 
              techniques; and (3) basic biochemical techniques used in the                   
              isolation of neuroactive substances.
