Abstract    :
              This project develops a laboratory to accompany a senior                       
              lecture course, Natural Gas Engineering.  The lecture course                   
              contains information on gas properties, flow measurements, and                 
              gas processing.  The laboratory course contains eight                          
              experiments designed to help students have a better                            
              understanding of the natural gas properties and operations: (1)                
              diaphragm meter, (2) gas gavity determination, (3) gas                         
              viscosity, (4) gas chromatograph, (5) retrograde condensation,                 
              (6) equillibrium constants, (7) hydrates formation, and (8)                    
              permeability reduction due to retrogade condensates.  The new                  
              equipment obtained includes a gas chromatograph, sampling                      
              valve, Ruska pump and a reactor.
