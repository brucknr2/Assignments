Abstract    :
              An Engineering Optics Laboratory for undergraduate students in                 
              the areas of physical optics, optical communications,                          
              integrated optics, lasers and optoelectronics is being                         
              developed.  The laboratory complements the theoretical courses                 
              being taught in the department at the undergraduate level.  Six                
              reconfigurable work stations are used for setting up various                   
              experiments to demonstrate the fundamental concepts of optics                  
              and provide knowledge of the basic optical phenomena and usage                 
              of optical elements, sources, detectors and instrumentation.                   
              Students perform specific experiments as suggested by the                      
              instructor as well as explore the world of optics on their own.
