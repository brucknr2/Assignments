Abstract    :
              The Faculty Scholars Program (FSP) Network is a network of                     
              computing systems set up in order to provide electronic mail                   
              and file transfer facilities for faculty at a number of                        
              Appalachian Colleges, as a means of helping them to maintain                   
              contacts with the University of Kentucky and other major                       
              research institutions.This NSF-funded project provides                         
              equipment which allows computers in the FSP Network to be used                 
              in five Appalachian colleges' instructional programs,                          
              especially in computer science and mathematics. The grant is                   
              managed by the Faculty Scholars Program at the University of                   
              Kentucky, and provides terminals and printers to member schools                
              for use with the FSP Network equipment for specific                            
              instructional projects.  Results of these projects are                         
              disseminated by means of the network; projects done at one                     
              school are typically applicable at the other schools.By taking                 
              advantage of an existing network and already existing computer                 
              systems with an established means of software support, it is                   
              possible with a limited budget to add multi-user state-of-the-                 
              art computing systems to the instructional programs of several                 
              colleges.  Each school benefits substantially from the efforts                 
              of the other schools in the network.NSF grant funds for                        
              equipment are being matched with funds from non-federal                        
              sources.
