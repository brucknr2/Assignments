Abstract    :
              This project improves the existing Robotics and Intelligent                    
              Systems Laboratory (RISL), currently consisting of a PUMA 562                  
              manipulator, two RTX educational robots and extensive VME-based                
              hardware.  The lab is used for class demonstrations,                           
              programming assignments, term projects, and research in                        
              undergraduate courses which cover robotics, artificial                         
              intelligence, computer control, neural computing and computer                  
              architectures.  Improvement of the RISL is provided by a robot                 
              vision system with the following major components:  frame                      
              grabber (DIGIMAX and FRAMESTORE boards), video convolution                     
              module (VFIR board), feature extraction and histogramming                      
              module (FEATUREMAX board) and supporting video software library                
              (IMAGEFLOW).  All these components are a set of Datacube's                     
              compatible boards which are be plugged into existing MPC-200                   
              workstation.  New equipment consisting of a standard CCD                       
              cameras with lenses, stands and monochrome monitor is being                    
              used in a sequence of pilot projects which starts with 2D                      
              recognition and locating simple known objects, and continues                   
              with 3D vision.  These projects provide basic tools for further                
              undergraduate research in robotics (path planning, object                      
              handling, simple assembly tasks, etc.) and artificial                          
              intelligence (image understanding, representation and planning                 
              in blocks world).  This project expands the application areas                  
              of existing robots, especially in the area of artificial                       
              intelligence, and makes undergraduate courses in robotics and                  
              AI more modern and  attractive to students seeking practical                   
              experience with high-tech instruments, such as robots and                      
              machine vision systems.
