Abstract    :
              A first step in the implementation of a common core curriculum                 
              is the establishment of a single Introduction to Engineering                   
              Design course in the freshman year and its associated 30-                      
              station computer laboratory.  The course emphasizes the                        
              solution of open-ended design problems in each of the                          
              engineering disciplines offered and involves the student in the                
              design process within each engineering discipline so that the                  
              individual can make informed career decisions while learning                   
              the importance of upcoming foundation courses and basic                        
              computer skills.  The design problems are multi-faceted                        
              requiring the access and usage of files in word processing,                    
              spreadsheet, CAD and problem solver software programs.  The                    
              design problems are created by an inter-disciplinary faculty                   
              team.  Problem solving skills that utilize the computer and                    
              computer software are developed during the first half of the                   
              course.  The course is four credit hours with three hours of                   
              lecture and a three hour lab.  The course replaces five                        
              discipline-specific introductory courses.
