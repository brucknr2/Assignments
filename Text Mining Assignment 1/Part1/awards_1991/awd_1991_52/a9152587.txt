Abstract    :
              An Argon ion laser, optical table and laser accessories are                    
              being used as part of an ongoing effort to create instructional                
              labs for three newly developed courses in the area of Lasers                   
              and Modern Optics, and improve two recently initiated major                    
              student projects: construction of a photoacoustic microscope                   
              and a diffusion measurement apparatus. A significant ingredient                
              of the project is the use of materials of high technological                   
              importance, such as liquid crystals, polymer dispersed liquid                  
              crystals, micellar systems, and colloidal particles, which                     
              provide new ways of performing laboratory experiments, and                     
              exposure to novel materials and their applications.  The                       
              acquired equipment is being used to achieve the following                      
              goals: a. create new experiments in the area of modern optics,                 
              b. significantly improve instruction on lasers and their                       
              applications, c. provide unique laboratory experiments and ways                
              of introducing nonlinear optics to the undergraduate                           
              curriculum, and d. strengthen student research in an                           
              undergraduate environment.  The versatility of the requested                   
              equipment assures its continued impact on future instructional                 
              and student research activities.NSF grant funds are being                      
              matched with funds from non-federal sources.
