Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to develop an optics laboratory to                 
              provide undergraduate students the opportunity for broader                     
              exposure to both traditional and modern optics.  A number of                   
              new optics experiments are being added to an existing optics                   
              laboratory.  A set of new experiments in traditional and                       
              contemporary optics are being developed: Michelson                             
              Interferometry, polarization, birefringence, measurements on                   
              optical fibers,  optical properties of solids.  The equipment                  
              is also improving an existing laser spectroscopy laboratory                    
              suitable for physics seniors.  The new capabilities allow                      
              students to investigate a broad range of optics and thus help                  
              build a broader physics curriculum.
