Abstract    :
              This proposal seeks to establish an undergraduate instructional                
              laboratory for programmable logic controllers (PLCs).  The                     
              laboratory trains students in the specification, installation                  
              and use of PLCs and thus better equips the students to be                      
              productive in the present day environment of industrial                        
              automation.  The laboratory is interdisciplinary in nature,                    
              serving the needs of both industrial and mechanical engineering                
              students.  The equipment consists of five PLC trainer modules                  
              called simulators, a sixth PLC for actual control of cell                      
              simulation modules, manufacturing cell simulation modules, and                 
              a microcomputer to act as a dedicated server to the PLC                        
              network.  Students are taught the basics of PLC programming,                   
              the programs checked out in the simulation mode by downloading                 
              the programs to the 5 PLC simulators through the network                       
              server, and finally downloaded into the sixth PLC, which will                  
              be in control of the manufacturing cell simulation modules.
