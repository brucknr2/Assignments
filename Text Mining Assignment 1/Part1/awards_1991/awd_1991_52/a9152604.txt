Abstract    :
              The addition of a multichannel seismograph to the Department of                
              Geological Sciences allows undergraduate students to acquire                   
              high quality, high resolution seismic reflection and refraction                
              data. Subsequent data reduction and analysis gives students the                
              ability to determine subsurface earth structure. The resulting                 
              high resolution subsurface images are used in water resource,
