Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to provide a learning environment                  
              that draws upon students' natural curiosity to explore and                     
              observe.  The stereoscopic brightfield microscopes, phase                      
              contrast microscope with video attachments for demonstrations,                 
              an IBM Info window Computer system with Laser Disk playback for                
              tutorials, and anatomical models, physiogrips and                              
              spectrophotometers allow the overwhelmingly minority and female                
              students served by the institution to obtain hands-on                          
              experience that influences their decision to consider careers                  
              in science and technology.
