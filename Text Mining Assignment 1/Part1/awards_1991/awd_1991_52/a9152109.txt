Abstract    :
              Queensborough Community College is upgrading the laboratory                    
              modern optics component of its technology courses by                           
              introducing current instrumentation for the study of the                       
              lasers.  Through laboratory experiments students gain an                       
              understanding of the principles and measurement techniques                     
              involved in the study and use of high power lasers.  The                       
              centerpiece of the laboratory is a mode-locked Nd-YAG laser.                   
              With the additional of a Q-switch and second harmonic                          
              generator, a number of experiments cover the principles of                     
              thermal lensing, acousto-optic modulation and mode-locking, Q-                 
              switching and non-linear optics (second harmonic generation).                  
              Along with aligning the lasers and beam profile measurements,                  
              these experiments provide a practical application of many of                   
              the principles discussed in optics courses.  By using sampling                 
              Oscilloscopes and fast photodetectors, students not only                       
              observe phenomena normally outside the range of observation but                
              also gain experience with valuable research tools.  The                        
              experience provides students who are uniquely equipped to                      
              either become laser technicians or continue in a four year                     
              degree program.
