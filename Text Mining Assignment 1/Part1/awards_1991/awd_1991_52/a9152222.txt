Abstract    :
              The Department of Physics at Morgan State University is                        
              modernizing its Electrical and Electronics Laboratory with                     
              instrumentation capable of being directly controlled by the                    
              students or by a personal computer or a combination of the two.                
              This permits tutorial exercises and also allows students to                    
              observe physical phenomenon to reinforce and provide meaning to                
              concepts presented in the classroom.  In cooperation with the                  
              Electrical Engineering Department, a laboratory is being                       
              developed in which a personal computer controls and rapidly                    
              gathers data from a variety of experiments.  Students are able                 
              also to use the personal computer to analyze and plot data and                 
              quickly experiment with various formulas to attempt to                         
              characterize their data.  Students may obtain high quality                     
              plots using printers attached to the PCs.
