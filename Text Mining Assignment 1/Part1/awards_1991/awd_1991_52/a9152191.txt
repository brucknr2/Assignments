Abstract    :
              The purpose of this project is to develop and enhance the                      
              quality of the Natural Sciences courses through realistic and                  
              engaging field labs which provide students a more comprehensive                
              and in-depth experience.  It uses the Payne's Prairie State                    
              Preserve as a field site for gathering a variety of data in the                
              four related disciplines (biology, ecology, chemistry and                      
              geology) and uses the interdisciplinary data base to generate                  
              realistic and engaging lab exercises in 15 courses with an                     
              annual enrollment of 5,930.  The Payne's Prairie State Preserve                
              is a 12,000 acre, natural, protected site, ten miles from the                  
              College which is a sanctuary for thousands of species of flora                 
              and fauna unique to north central Florida.  The College has                    
              been given access to remote areas of this protected land.The                   
              major equipment request falls into three groups: 1. Computers                  
              and peripherals to establish and maintain a data base to be                    
              shared by the four discipline groups.  2. Equipment necessary                  
              to establish permanent meteorological sites.  3. Video                         
              equipment with a display board to link images with                             
              computers.NSF grant funds are being matched with funds from                    
              non-federal sources.
