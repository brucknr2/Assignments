Abstract    :
              A 200 MHz proton/carbon-l3 Fourier transform nuclear magnetic                  
              resonance spectrometer will be incorporated in the chemistry                   
              curriculum from the first through fourth year levels.  Students                
              will use the equipment to determine the barriers of rotation                   
              around a chemical bond, to calculate the thermodynamic and                     
              kinetic functions for various chemical reactions, and to                       
              analyze the magnetic susceptibility of paramagnetic compounds.                 
              Students will determine structures of complex molecules using                  
              multi-pulse sequence and two-dimensional techniques.  The                      
              instrument will greatly improve the quality of our courses and                 
              our undergraduate research program.  The grantee will match the                
              NSf award from non-Federal sources.
