Abstract    :
              The project proposes equipping the psychology department's                     
              laboratories with 14 Macintosh computers and related hardware                  
              as a practical and flexible way to support our experimentally                  
              oriented courses.  With emphasis on teaching, providing a solid                
              foundation in traditional areas of the discipline, and                         
              involving undergraduate majors in significant research                         
              experiences, psychology is a relatively strong undergraduate                   
              department.  At the center of our curriculum is a core of three                
              courses in experimental areas that lead majors through content                 
              and methodological issues to a final senior research project.                  
              A deficit of equipment places a severe constraint on our                       
              ability to provide laboratory support for these core courses.                  
              Macintosh computers with HyperCard software would permit us to                 
              include laboratory experiments in perception, learning, memory,                
              and cognition along with opportunities for undergraduates to                   
              design their own programs for use in senior research projects.                 
              A computer-based laboratory would be the most practical and                    
              effective way to meet our most pressing need.
