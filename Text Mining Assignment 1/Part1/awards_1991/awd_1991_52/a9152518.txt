Abstract    :
              The Department of Geography and Planning is establishing a                     
              microcomputer laboratory to support the teaching of                            
              cartography, and spatial analysis by integrating microcomputer                 
              program modules into currently existing courses. The laboratory                
              is improving the student's spatial analysis skills in                          
              cartography, quantitative methods and decision-making. The                     
              project is producing teaching
