Abstract    :
              A Unified System Design Laboratory (USDL) to support an                        
              innovative approach to the upper level systems courses in                      
              computer science is being developed at University of North                     
              Carolina Asheville.  The current operating systems course                      
              sequence is based upon a paradigm that includes formal                         
              laboratory sections in the core classes and project oriented                   
              laboratory work in the elective classes.  The new laboratory                   
              allows the  extension of this paradigm to all of our upper                     
              level systems classes: Operating Systems, Networking, and VLSI                 
              Design.  Entry level color Sun workstations and a file server                  
              are used.  The USDL permits building upon the faculty's special                
              expertise in each of these areas.  Wayne Lang has taught a well                
              attended VLSI Design class at UNCA for four years.  Dean Brock                 
              developed a popular networking class taken by most of the                      
              graduate students at UNC-Chapel Hill.  Mark Boyd created UNCA's                
              unique Operating Systems sequence and has worked with formal                   
              laboratories for the past six years.  UNCA has a rich history                  
              of support for undergraduate research, and a high percentage of                
              graduates are attending graduate school.  The USDL provides                    
              experience for the students that will enhance their                            
              undergraduate research opportunities and encourage them to                     
              pursue further research upon graduation.
