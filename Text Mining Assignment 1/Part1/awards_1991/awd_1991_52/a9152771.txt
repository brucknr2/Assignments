Abstract    :
              The Chemistry Department is equipping a laboratory for polymer                 
              studies to introduce mechanical testing, surface analysis and                  
              elementary processing techniques into the curriculum. The new                  
              instruments are increasing the hands-on experience by                          
              undergraduate students with state-of-the-art instrumentation                   
              and increasing the diversity of the polymer-related experiments                
              performed. Chemistry majors taking analytical and physical                     
              chemistry laboratories are also benefitting from exposure to                   
              experiments involving polymers which utilize the equipment.
