Abstract    :
              This project is upgrading and modernizing an undergraduate                     
              laboratory in optics at the University of Arkansas.  The                       
              revised undergraduate laboratory in optics includes concepts of                
              classical and modern optics.  It uses a novel approach to the                  
              teaching of optics in that it allows students to explore                       
              experimentally almost all the concepts that they learn in                      
              lecture, and it emphasizes both qualitative and quantitative                   
              understanding of concepts.  The upgraded laboratory                            
              incorporates modern instruments and modern developments in                     
              optics.NSF grant funds are being matched with funds from non-                  
              federal sources.
