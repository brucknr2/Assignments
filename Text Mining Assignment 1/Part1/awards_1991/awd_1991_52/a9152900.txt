Abstract    :
              FTIR will be incorporated into general chemistry, organic and                  
              advanced organic chemistry, physical chemistry, inorganic                      
              chemistry, and independent study (directed research).  The                     
              instrument will be used in general chemistry to analyze gases                  
              in Los Angeles smog.  In the organic and advanced organic                      
              chemistry laboratories, the instrument will be used to                         
              characterize products from various experiments, including                      
              multistep synthetic sequences.  In physical chemistry the                      
              instrument will measure the fundamental absorption bands of HCl                
              while the inorganic laboratory will study CO stretching bands                  
              on various carbonyl compounds.  The instrument will also see                   
              considerable use in our heavily enrolled undergraduate research                
              courses (independent study).  The grantee will match tne NSF                   
              award from non-Federal sources.
