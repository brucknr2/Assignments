Abstract    :
              The purpose of the above course is to introduce students to                    
              state-of-the-art procedures and instrumentation relating to the                
              use and synthesis of oligonucleotides as probes, primers and                   
              instruments of mutagenesis.  The instrumentation, which                        
              includes a DNA synthesizers, high pressure liquid                              
              chromatographic systems and DNA tempcyclers, is used in the                    
              synthesis of oligonucleotides, the isolation of                                
              oligonucleotides, plasmids and PCR-generated DNA fragments                     
              using HPLC, and to introduce mutations using oligonucleotides.
