Abstract    :
              Liberal arts students and potential chemistry majors in the                    
              second semester of general chemistry laboratory will carry out                 
              modern instrument-based analyses of natural water samples.                     
              Results will form an annually updated data base for local                      
              environmental monitoring.  Concentrations of ammonia, oxygen,                  
              fluoride, chloride, hydronium, nitrate, nitrite, and                           
              hypochlorite ions, and total hardness will be determined.                      
              Students will learn concepts of sample collection and                          
              preservation, the chemical complexity of natural samples, and                  
              standard (EPA) analytical methods.  The instruments to be used                 
              are spectrophotometers and pH/ISE meters with ion selective                    
              electrodes.  A high school chemistry class will also perform                   
              these exercises.  The grantee will match the NSF award from                    
              non-Federal sources.
