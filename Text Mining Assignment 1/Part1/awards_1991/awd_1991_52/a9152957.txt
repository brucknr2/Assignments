Abstract    :
              Acquisition of laboratory instructional instrumentation allows                 
              a quantum improvement to be made in the quality of applied                     
              optics instruction offered to Cornell engineering students by                  
              the Engineering Physics program at Cornell.  The equipment                     
              yeilds substantial and material improvement in the                             
              instructional and laboratory content of an existing, and                       
              already quite successful, laboratory course on "The Laser and                  
              Its Applications in Science, Technology and Medicine", a course                
              which is currently taken by 25% of all Cornell engineering                     
              students. It is our contention that students more easily grasp                 
              difficult concepts in modern optics if they have hands-on                      
              experience with these tools and are exposed to experiments that                
              vividly illustrate particular principles.  Experiments are                     
              being developed that demonstrate short optical pulse and low                   
              light level detection, dye laser tuning, Raman scattering, and                 
              spectroscopic "finger printing".The motivation behind our                      
              objective is simple; the extensive use of advanced optics, and                 
              lasers in particular, is pervasive in almost all scientific and                
              engineering disciplines and is rapidly growing. Despite this                   
              fact and the widely published forecasts of the coming photonics                
              revolution in the next century, minimal attention is generally                 
              given to the adequate education of significant number of U.S.                  
              engineering undergraduates in the principles underlying applied                
              optics, and in the practical use of these optical tools.
