Abstract    :
              A 60 MHz FT-NMR spectrometer will be used in laboratory courses                
              and for undergraduate student research, including the summer                   
              research program.  The organic chemistry laboratories will see                 
              four new experiments and three revised ones that deal with                     
              regiochemistry and stereochemistry of reactions and with the                   
              identification of unknowns.  New experiments in physical                       
              chemistry will deal with the effect of solvent on equilibrium                  
              constants and the effects of electronegativity on chemical                     
              shift.  The instrumental methods experiment will use NMR to                    
              determine the molecular weight of samples.  Instruction in FT                  
              methodology will occur in several classes.  Undergraduate                      
              research students will pursue projects in organic synthesis and                
              catalytic chemistry that were not available before.  The                       
              grantee will match the NSF award from non-Federal sources.
