Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to consolidate the present                    
              departmentally diffused programs in control systems into a                     
              common program emphasizing basic control theory; modeling,                     
              simulation and optimization issues; computer-aided control                     
              system design methodology; laboratory techniques; and computer-                
              aided visualization.  In order to accomplish this objective a                  
              number of laboratory experimental stations are developed which                 
              directly support the revised classroom/workstation course                      
              materials; characterize typical computer-in-the-loop control                   
              systems design problems a variety of disciplines; can be                       
              expanded and integrated with the full spectrum of control                      
              systems design and analysis tools; introduce the student to                    
              modern measurement and actuation techniques;  and are readily                  
              modified to respond to the needs and development of future                     
              controls technology.
