Abstract    :
              The Department of chemistry is purchasing a high field NMR for                 
              use in undergraduate laboratory courses and research.  The                     
              instrument is providing undergraduates with hands-on experience                
              in spectroscopic measurements and interpretation of data                       
              through a policy of open-access to modern instrumentation.                     
              Students are performing 1 dimensional multi-pulse experiments,                 
              2 dimensional spectroscopy, and examining hetero nuclear                       
              compounds. The purchase of the instrument is being jointly                     
              funded by the Division of Undergraduate Science, Engineering                   
              and Mathematics Education, and The Division of Chemistry.
