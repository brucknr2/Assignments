Abstract    :
              The intent of this project is to integrate the use of computers                
              and associated technology into the introductory physics courses                
              in order to 1) assist students in becoming more competent in                   
              the use of these powerful tools in the laboratory and their                    
              homework, 2) improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the                   
              teaching of physics and 3) to increase the insights into and                   
              understanding of physics by students by involving them in the                  
              more computational and model building/simulation aspects of                    
              physics.The goals are being accomplished through the                           
              establishment of a network of laboratory workstations connected                
              to a file/print server and printers. This network is also                      
              connected to a lecture teaching station, instructor stations,                  
              and an existing local area network. The laboratory stations are                
              supplied with hardware and software to support data and                        
              graphical analysis, analog and image data acquisition, report                  
              generation, tutorials and a problem/question database. The                     
              students do experiments designed to teach them competency in                   
              the use of these tools for analysis and increase their                         
              understanding of physics concepts. The teaching station                        
              supports the display of large static images, high resolution                   
              dynamic images, interactive videodisc and videotape as well as                 
              conversion of computer images to videotape.
