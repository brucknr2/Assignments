Abstract    :
              The Department of Geography is purchasing computer-based data-                 
              acquisition systems including albedometers and pyrradiometers                  
              that will allow quantification and analysis of radiation                       
              balance terms.  Sensor systems are deployed by students at                     
              various sites with differing surface characteristics (e.g.,                    
              grass, concrete, gravel) to determine shortwave and longwave                   
              energy-flux densities. The results are compared to various                     
              theoretical models  for atmospheric energy balance. These                      
              studies are are expected to lead to a greater understanding of
