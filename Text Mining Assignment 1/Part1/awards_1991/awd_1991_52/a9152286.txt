Abstract    :
              The teaching/learning environment in undergraduate physics                     
              laboratories inhibits critical thinking about the experiment,                  
              the data, and the physics by a lack of time to do detailed                     
              analysis of the data during the laboratory period. This                        
              situation can be corrected significantly by the use of                         
              microcomputers in the laboratory with data acquisition hardware                
              and software to speed data collection.  A spread sheet program                 
              and a graphical package allow real-time data manipulation                      
              leading toward increased confidence in the quality of the data                 
              and into insights into the physics the data portray.  Student                  
              or instructor written programs provide special analysis                        
              tools.This new environment, common to the physics researcher,                  
              now can be the domain of the physics student.  Modest prices                   
              for powerful desk-top computers makes it possible to install                   
              one work station for every two students with data acquisition                  
              hardware and software.  Given these tools and guided in their                  
              constructive use, students can investigate the "what if"                       
              questions prompted by a critical analysis of the experiment.                   
              A greater appreciation of the real methodologies of                            
              experimental physics can emerge and develop.
