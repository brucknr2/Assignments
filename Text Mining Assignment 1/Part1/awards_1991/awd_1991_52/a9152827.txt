Abstract    :
              A laboratory experience is being integrated into the three-                    
              semester calculus sequence for students of engineering and the                 
              sciences.  Meeting in weekly laboratory sessions and working on                
              out-of-class assignments, students are using the symbolic,                     
              numerical and graphical capabilities of Mathematica, a powerful                
              computer algebra system, to both reinforce and anticipate ideas                
              being developed in the classroom.
