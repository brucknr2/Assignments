Abstract    :
              This project provides undergraduates with the opportunity to                   
              develop their skills and expertise in experimental Behavioral                  
              Biology through a series of laboratory experiments with weakly                 
              electric fish.  The major items of equipment requested include                 
              six identical sets of equipment composed of a digital storage                  
              oscilloscope, a microelectrode amplifier, a frequency counter,                 
              and a function generator.  This equipment is used by the                       
              students to carry out Animal Behavior Laboratory experiments                   
              in communication, electrolocation, receptor physiology, and                    
              physiological behavior.  The students' active participation                    
              in the design and conduct of such experiments, rather than                     
              observing a demonstration, enhances their understanding of                     
              the concepts involved and research methodology, and provides                   
              an opportunity to become familiar with the type of equipment                   
              used in modern Behavioral Biology research.
