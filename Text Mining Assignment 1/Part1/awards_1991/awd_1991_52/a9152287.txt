Abstract    :
              This project complements the quantitative measurements made in                 
              a subsonic wind tunnel by visible correlation of actual fluid                  
              behavior.  This is made possible by a bubble generator which                   
              produces neutrally buoyant helium bubbles that trace the air                   
              flow over the model.
