Abstract    :
              Funds are requested to replace an outdated psychology                          
              laboratory with a local area network of computers for                          
              psychological research.  Funds are also requested for software                 
              that will significantly increase the ability of undergraduates                 
              to program their own experiments, facilitate the ability of                    
              faculty advisors to monitor and assist students with the                       
              implementation of experiments on computers, and allow the                      
              department to develop a repository of psychological experiments                
              that are easy to modify for use by students for independent                    
              research and for laboratory exercises in a number of courses.                  
              The project is designed to increase the availability of                        
              sophisticated computer-controlled experiments to undergraduates                
              who are typically not prepared to program or execute such                      
              experiments.
