Abstract    :
              The Department of Geological Sciences is purchasing a variety                  
              of optical equipment for use in a three-tiered approach to                     
              undergraduate education. The first tier is use of video-                       
              integrated microscopes in the introductory-level laboratories                  
              to increase student comprehension and laboratory productivity.                 
              The second level is the introduction of video technology into                  
              the upper-division undergraduate laboratories studying texture,                
              composition and optical propoerties of minerals and rocks.  The                
              third level is the establishment of an undergraduate research                  
              microscopy laboratory.
