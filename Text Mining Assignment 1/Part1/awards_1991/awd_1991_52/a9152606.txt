Abstract    :
              The purpose of this project is to improve the undergraduate                    
              laboratory courses in civil engineering by integrating state of                
              the art interactive graphics computer hardware and software                    
              with the experimental program. The addition of this capability                 
              allows upgrading of the undergraduate laboratory course through                
              the use of more sophisticated experiments which can now easily                 
              be related to theoretical analyses.  The equipment also permits                
              the laboratory courses to be more closely related to the                       
              comprehensive design project now underway in the department.
