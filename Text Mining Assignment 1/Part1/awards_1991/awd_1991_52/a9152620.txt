Abstract    :
              The department is developing a program designed to attract more                
              students, especially females and minorities, into professional                 
              careers in Neurobiology, modeled after programs we are just                    
              implementing in Molecular and Environmental Biology. It begins                 
              with our introductory course in Biology (taken by biology and                  
              science majors and premedical students) by offering optional                   
              laboratories (taken anyplace of the regular laboratories) for                  
              the more motivated and talented students. These special                        
              laboratories will involve the students in fascinating, advanced                
              experiments that more accurately represent the opportunities                   
              and challenges in Neurobiology. Advanced undergraduate courses                 
              in Animal Physiology and Neurobiology will attract students                    
              where they will learn the major ideas, procedures and may                      
              "catch" the excitement of a career in Neurobiology. The                        
              Neurobiology course will involve both structured labs, and                     
              independently planned and executed projects by the students.                   
              This will serve as a gateway for some into at least one year of                
              research, working with our neurobiology research group.
