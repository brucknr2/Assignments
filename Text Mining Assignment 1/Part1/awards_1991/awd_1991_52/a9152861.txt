Abstract    :
              This project is to improve the accessibility of the Novell                     
              microcomputer network's "'Virtual Social Science Laboratory" to                
              Sociology majors.  The lab can only be accessed in one building                
              on campus, Evans Hall.  Sociology classrooms, graduate                         
              assistants and professors' offices are all in Arkansas Hall.                   
              Upgrading the display capabilities in the proposed Arkansas                    
              Hall node of the lab will include color, and classroom pedagogy                
              will improve by providing professors the ability to demonstrate                
              laboratory findings "live"' in the classroom with the use of an                
              overhead display.  The three required core classes of                          
              Statistics, Research Methods, and Theory will become better                    
              integrated by using a networked common body of databases,                      
              research simulations, computer conferencing and expert systems.                
              Students will gain hands-on experience in creating, storing,                   
              and manipulating data files.  With the electronic mail                         
              capabilities students can gain valuable experience in                          
              scientific collaboration by communicating with sociology majors                
              at other institutions in the state over ARKnet.
