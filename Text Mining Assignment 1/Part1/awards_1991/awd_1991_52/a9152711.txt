Abstract    :
              The introductory general physics laboratories are ideal                        
              environments in which to introduce modern, automated (computer                 
              interfaced) instrumentation and the analysis of uncertainty in                 
              experimental and theoretical results.  The results to be                       
              measured and calculated in this project are angular                            
              accelerations of metal disks rotating on air cushions.  Having                 
              purchased one complete instructional unit with funds raised by                 
              pre-engineering students, faculty have determined that                         
              experimental measurements and theoretical predictions of                       
              angular accelerations agree to within about 0.4%.This project                  
              is resulting in the acquisition of five additional                             
              instructional units to be used in all general physics                          
              laboratories at the University of St. Thomas and the                           
              introduction of automated instrumentation and computerized data                
              analysis in these laboratories.  Computer results of the data                  
              analysis supplement (not replace) the students' own                            
              calculations.NSF grant funds are being matched with funds from                 
              non-federal sources.
