Abstract    :
              This project is expanding the Oberlin College physics                          
              department's existing network of two UNIX work-stations                        
              (currently used solely for research) to nine machines.  These                  
              computers are being used for student/faculty research and for                  
              assignments and projects in existing courses, but most                         
              importantly they are making possible a new course entitled                     
              "Introduction to Computational Physics". This course takes                     
              advantage of the many cases in which the physical question and                 
              its algorithmic solution are intimately linked, so the physics                 
              and the algorithm illuminate each other.  Because it exploits                  
              this link to the fullest, the course has only one prerequisite                 
              physics course, and thus is taken by students as early as their                
              freshman year.  The course 1) excites and attracts students at                 
              an early stage in their college careers, 2) allows appropriate                 
              use of computation throughout the physics curriculum, and 3)                   
              develops the student's physical insight.NSF grant funds are                    
              being matched with funds from non-federal sources.
