Abstract    :
              A local area network of graphic-oriented microcomputers, a                     
              database server machine, document scanning and printing                        
              devices, and software is being configured as a laboratory model                
              of a small office system together with capabilities for                        
              software development.  The laboratory supports instruction of                  
              computer science in three areas: (i) office system development:                
              hands-on experience using and developing systems for a "real"                  
              office environment; (ii) software engineering: use of graphic                  
              CASE (Computer Aided Software Engineering) tools including                     
              prototyping tools; and (iii) human-machine interaction:                        
              development of software using visual forms and direct-                         
              manipulation, input and processing of forms, pictures, and                     
              voice data, and use and development of systems for                             
              collaborative work.  The laboratory supports junior and senior                 
              level laboratory-oriented courses in the three subject areas                   
              for majors in computing and information sciences, and                          
              electrical and computer engineering.  Students in the office                   
              automation laboratory serve as "users" of software for the                     
              software development laboratories.  Office software includes                   
              desktop publishing, electronic messaging, and a shared                         
              information system for personnel and accounting data.  This                    
              laboratory provides undergraduate computing science experience                 
              from program development to information systems development.
