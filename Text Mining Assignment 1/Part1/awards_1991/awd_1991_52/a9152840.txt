Abstract    :
              A laboratory based on "Networked Engineering Workstations" is                  
              being developed to provide an environment which encourages                     
              students to focus on concepts and material, equipment which                    
              actively assists in learning, and which eliminates                             
              computational impediments in the laboratory.  This environment                 
              provides an opportunity to learn practical and theoretical                     
              control, instrumentation and data collection/analysis by                       
              providing computer (Dell 386SX) based instruments (IEEE-488                    
              oscilloscopes, spectrum analyzers and microprogrammer                          
              emulators).  In this environment students write to learn,                      
              integrate theory and practice at a high level using software                   
              packages (Lotus spreadsheet, Matlab).  They implement complex                  
              designs in signal processing, control systems, electronics,                    
              linear systems and instrumentation courses using the control                   
              system simulation and design package (Tutsim).The equipment is                 
              used throughout the Electrical Engineering curriculum, and                     
              throughout Bucknell in all courses offered in control systems,                 
              instrumentation, and courses in digital design and introductory                
              engineering.
