Abstract    :
               The goal of this project is to involve advanced biology                       
              students at this historically black institution in modern                      
              methods for purifying and analyzing biomolecules.  A low speed                 
              preparative centrifuge and an ultracentrifuge are requested to                 
              introduce students to modern methods in molecular separation,                  
              as well as experience in a wide range of traditional                           
              techniques.
