Abstract    :
              A major expansion of an Undergraduate Scientific and                           
              Engineering Visualization Laboratory (USEVL) to be directed by                 
              Professor Norman I. Badler.  Based on the Director's existing                  
              nationally and internationally recognized Computer Graphics                    
              effort, the USEVL brings modern high-performance workstations                  
              for visualization into the Undergraduate curriculum and                        
              experience.  Visualization provides the most direct and                        
              exciting pathway into modern high-performance computing.  Not                  
              only does the Computer Science student learn the principles and                
              use of high-speed workstations, but the experience carries over                
              into many other aspects of scientific and technological                        
              education.  Conversely, non-Computer Science majors (that is,                  
              other Engineering and Science majors), discover that the power                 
              of visualization can be applied to the fundamental concepts and                
              applications of their own disciplines.  The development expands                
              the existing educational graphics nucleus of four Silicon                      
              Graphics Iris 4D workstations by adding five workstations plus                 
              a fast fileserver.  Existing in-house and no-cost commercial                   
              software will be used to provide instant usability for the                     
              USEVL facility.
