Abstract    :
              The primary objective of the proposed project is to enhance the                
              laboratory experience of undergraduate engineering students,                   
              especially mechanical engineering students, studying fluid                     
              mechanics and general laboratory instrumentation by introducing                
              them to a state-of-the-art subsonic wind tunnel with ancillary                 
              pressure, flow and force transducers. A second objective is to                 
              acquaint non-science majors with fundamental principles of                     
              fluid mechanics via experimentation as a component of two newly                
              developed introductory courses. In addition, the strong appeal                 
              of model aircraft aerodynamic testing will be exploited to                     
              attract local minority junior and senior high school students                  
              to engineering via a special minority engineering program.
