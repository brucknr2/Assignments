Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry is purchasing equipment to enable                  
              undergraduate students to study solids in a general chemistry                  
              course. The laboratory experiments include the synthesis of                    
              superconducting oxides and their subsequent analysis using x-                  
              ray powder diffractometry. This solid state laboratory is also                 
              used by advanced undergraduate students in studies of crystal                  
              structure and phase analysis.
