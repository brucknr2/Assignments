Abstract    :
              This project is developing contemporary physics activities,                    
              including a laboratory component, in two courses for future                    
              teachers.  In the laboratory the future teachers complete in                   
              depth a variety of experiments in atomic, nuclear and condensed                
              matter physics.  Parallel to the experiments the future                        
              teachers study methods of teaching by exploring the use of                     
              simple equipment, analogies, computer simulations and                          
              interactive video. The parallel approach of an in-depth study                  
              coupled to methods of teaching the same material prepare future                
              teachers to teach modern physics.
