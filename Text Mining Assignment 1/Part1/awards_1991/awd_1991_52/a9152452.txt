Abstract    :
              The goal of the project is the improvement of the undergraduate                
              environmental engineering education through an increased                       
              emphasis on the theory, design and modeling of environmental                   
              treatment systems.  This results in an increase of required                    
              course work and laboratory exercises in the environmental                      
              engineering area.  Major pieces of equipment purchased include                 
              total organic carbon analyzer, spectrophotometer,                              
              electrophoresis unit, and several physical and chemical unit                   
              processes (activated carbon column, sand filtration apparatus,                 
              settling tank/column) The analytical and process equipment are                 
              used in a laboratory setting to teach students the importance                  
              of water/wastewater characterization, reinforce the theory                     
              behind each unit process, and introduce the role of laboratory                 
              treatment studies in design and operation of full-scale                        
              physical, chemical, and biological water/wastewater treatment                  
              systems.
