Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to increase understanding and                      
              awareness of recombinant DNA technology so that non-science                    
              majors are better prepared to make relevant connections between                
              science and their everyday experience.  Gel electrophoresis                    
              equipment and computer workstations provide undergraduate women                
              served by this institution with experience in DNA analysis and                 
              a practical working knowledge of genetic engineering, and allow                
              students to visualize the laboratory techniques and to                         
              experience more complex laboratories without the expense of                    
              additional equipment or knowledge of more difficult laboratory                 
              methods.
