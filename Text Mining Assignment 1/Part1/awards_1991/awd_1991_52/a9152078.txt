Abstract    :
              This project focuses on the introduction of Fourier transform                  
              infrared (FTIR) microscopy in the undergraduate materials                      
              engineering curriculum.  The FTIR Spectrometer and FTIR                        
              microscope have proven value as analytical tools in a wide                     
              range of applications; however, the utility of the technique                   
              for materials analysis and characterization has received little                
              attention from engineers.  Several experiments have been                       
              developed to highlight basic principles such as adsorption and                 
              corrosion on metal surfaces, covalent metallic bonding,                        
              characterization of thin oxide films deposited on semiconductor                
              metal surfaces, characterization of integrated circuits, and                   
              characterization of polymers and coatings.
