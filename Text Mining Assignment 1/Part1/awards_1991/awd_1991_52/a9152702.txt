Abstract    :
              The calculus curriculum is being reformed by adapting the                      
              materials produced by Duke University's ProjectCALC.  Duke's                   
              materials embody a radical revision of the calculus curriculum,                
              building the course around (I) selected problem areas in the                   
              sciences that motivate the introduction of calculus techniques,                
              (2) a discovery-based computer laboratory, conducted in much                   
              the same way as a laboratory for a science course, and (3)                     
              writing assignments which place the major emphasis of the                      
              course on conceptual understanding not solely computational                    
              skills.
