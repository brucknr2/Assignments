Abstract    :
              The proposed multidisciplinary graphics design laboratory                      
              (MGDL), provides terminal-based, interactive instruction in                    
              courses of five academic departments: Industrial, Electrical,                  
              Mechanical, Biomedical and Engineering Core.  The facility                     
              includes ten high-resolution workstations, and twenty-five                     
              medium-resolution terminals, networked to a Digital Equipment                  
              Corporation, VAX 4000 central computer, with its supporting                    
              disc memory and interconnect peripherals. The applications                     
              software chosen for the MGDL provides advanced analysis,                       
              design, and graphic visualization capability and has the                       
              greatest impact on the upper level, design course instruction,                 
              and on the special senior research/design program.  The MGDL's                 
              capabilities are also used to assist high school teachers in                   
              upgrading their technical skills and knowledge of modern                       
              engineering laboratories and educational methods.
