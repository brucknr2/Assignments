Abstract    :
              The mechanical systems laboratory is required for all                          
              undergraduates choosing the mechanical systems stem.  The                      
              objectives of the laboratory are to reinforce the mechanical                   
              disciplines taught in courses;  to expose the students to                      
              selected mechanical technologies, beyond those taught in the                   
              class room, thought to be particularly revealing of                            
              technologies that will be important in their professional                      
              careers;  and to convince the students that they can learn                     
              material that is not presented in class and to prepare them to                 
              do so.  Four of the six experiments are conducted at flexible                  
              laboratory stations and set up by the students using checked-                  
              out equipment. Two are dedicated experimental centers that are                 
              on-line so that students can acquire the experiment data,                      
              experimental set-up, and analysis tools thru the campus                        
              communications network. One of these allows direct student                     
              control of the experiment on-line.  The major pieces of                        
              equipment include a milling machine, equipment for six flexible                
              stations (digital scopes, micro-computers, etc.), vibratory                    
              motion, force, and acoustic transducers, and a computer                        
              workstation.
