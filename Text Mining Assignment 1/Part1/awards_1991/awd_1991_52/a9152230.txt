Abstract    :
              Six workstations plus associated software are being used to                    
              develop courses in software development, artificial                            
              intelligence, and mathematical foundations of computer                         
              graphics.  Students use CASE tools, tools for studying                         
              artificial intelligence and developing expert systems including                
              LISP and PROLOG, and graphics software in the three upper                      
              division courses.  A graphics printer/plotter also facilitates                 
              student learning.
