Abstract    :
              A parallel computing laboratory facility is being established                  
              for developing a distinct course in parallel computing and                     
              upgrading the instructional content of other undergraduate                     
              computer science courses that make use of parallel concepts.                   
              This includes, but is not limited to, analysis of algorithms,                  
              operating systems, programming languages, artificial                           
              intelligence, senior projects, data base systems, and numerical                
              analysis.  The project utilizes an existing network host-server                
              that will be connected to a multiple-processor parallel                        
              computer system using Transputers.  The Transputer system and                  
              related software for parallel programming is being purchased as                
              part of the grant.  Course modules are being developed                         
              initially as part of special topics courses and then are being                 
              allowed to migrate as appropriate to other courses in the                      
              curriculum, including a separate course on parallel computing                  
              that is to be developed.  As parallel computing takes on more                  
              significance in the real world of computer systems the project                 
              will be used to strengthen the related foundations of computer                 
              science education and give students experience in a variety of                 
              parallel computing applications.
