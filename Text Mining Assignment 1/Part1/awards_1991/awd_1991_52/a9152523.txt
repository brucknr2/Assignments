Abstract    :
              A rasterbased graphics workstation environment is being                        
              established to provide laboratory support for teaching computer                
              graphics effectively and for developing a new curriculum for                   
              the subject area.  The environment consists of one 24-bit                      
              workstation, fourteen 8-bit workstations, and two color                        
              printers.  It enables teaching a full spectrum of material                     
              ranging from illumination models to graphical user interfaces,                 
              with selected topics covered in an introductory graphics course                
              at the senior level and more advanced topics in honors                         
              problems.  It also gives the opportunity to experiment with                    
              restructuring the traditional vector-oriented curriculum by                    
              incorporating several state-of-the-art theories and techniques,                
              thus providing the students with a coherent and well-balanced                  
              exposure to both the fundamental principles and the engineering                
              aspects of computer graphics.
