Abstract    :
               The undergraduate field and laboratory courses in archaeology                 
              and physical anthropology within the Anthropology Program at                   
              Kansas State University are being up-graded.  It is proposed to                
              purchase a microscope video recorder and monitor to be used                    
              with an existing binocular microscope as an innovative method                  
              for teaching students edge-wear analysis of stone and bone                     
              tools in archaeology. Additionally, it is requested that both                  
              a binocular microscope with camera mount, a video-recorder/                    
              monitor  and a VCR/player be purchased for teaching students to                
              analyze bone wear and breakage as well as bone damage                          
              associated with forensic analyses in physical anthropology.
