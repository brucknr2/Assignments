Abstract    :
              A Transputer-based undergraduate parallel processing laboratory                
              is being established with IBM-PC-compatible MS-DOS machines                    
              equipped with INMOS transputer boards and the Transputer                       
              Development System (TDS) environment using the parallel                        
              programming language OCCAM2.  The purpose of this laboratory is                
              to support instruction in parallel programming and                             
              architectures, using the Occam/TDS environment, for                            
              undergraduate computer science and mathematics majors.  Target                 
              courses are Algorithms, Computer Organization, Computer                        
              Graphics and Numerical Analysis, ranging from sophomore to                     
              senior level.  Selected projects provide the students with                     
              hands-on experience for reinforcing the conceptual                             
              understanding of parallel design issues, including parallel                    
              architectures, systematic mapping of systolic arrays on                        
              transputer networks, process farming, pipelining, buffering,                   
              message-passing, inter-connection topologies and speed-up                      
              analysis of common algorithms.  After an introduction, the                     
              students are expected to program variations of these developed                 
              projects.
