Abstract    :
              A coherent set of laboratory experiments is developed that                     
              demonstrates the application of chemical engineering principles                
              in biotechnology. This program is used in the undergraduate                    
              Chemical Engineering laboratory course to provide a core set of                
              experiments that introduces Chemical Engineering students to                   
              biotechnology, and provides in-depth exposure for students in                  
              the newly instituted Engineering Biology Certificate Program.                  
              The laboratory experiments center around the production,                       
              isolation and purification of alkaline phosphatases from                       
              bacterial fermentations using either E. coli or Bacillus                       
              subtilis. The experiments follow the processes that would be                   
              used in the commercial production of the enzyme. They include:                 
              1) a fermentation experiment, demonstrating microbial growth                   
              and product formation as well as O2 mass transfer; 2) an                       
              extraction experiment, demonstrating cell lysis and membrane                   
              permeabilization; 3) a cell harvesting experiment, comparing                   
              ultrafiltration and centrifugation and emphasizing scale-up                    
              considerations; 4) a purification experiment, demonstrating                    
              chromatographic and electrophoretic methods for isolation and                  
              characterization of proteins; and 5) an enzyme kinetics                        
              experiment, demonstrating methods for testing enzyme mechanisms                
              by analysis of the kinetics of product inhibition.
