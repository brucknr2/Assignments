Abstract    :
              This project establishes an undergraduate lab for materials                    
              processing. It involves advanced materials processing,                         
              specifically for ceramic powder synthesis, characterization,                   
              and densification analysis. The instruments are associated with                
              precise quantification of particle size distribution and                       
              surface area with computer-based data analysis. Equipment for                  
              controlled chemistry densification studies is also involved.                   
              Laboratory exercises illustrating fundamental principles of                    
              intermolecular forces, mass transport mechanisms, chemical                     
              stability and solid solution formation, and solidification                     
              theory of glass are incorporated into appropriate places of                    
              several courses.
