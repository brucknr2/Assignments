Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Arkansas                 
              at Fayetteville, is using a differential scanning calorimeter                  
              to establish the first material science experiments in two                     
              undergraduate lab courses and to create a laboratory component                 
              in a polymers lecture course.  Currently, the curriculum is                    
              deficient in materials science offerings relative to the                       
              importance of this area and the establishment of these                         
              experiments is an integral part of the department's current                    
              plans for expansion into material science education.  It is                    
              intended to introduce students to this pervasive area so that                  
              they may be aware of their opportunities in related fields such                
              as polymers, microelectronics, catalysis and other solid-state                 
              subdisciplines.  The differential scanning calorimeter was                     
              selected because it provides the largest number of useful                      
              experiments in the general area of materials science available                 
              in a single, expandable system.  All undergraduates are exposed                
              to it in the sophomore and senior level lab courses, and it is                 
              also used in a polymers course.
