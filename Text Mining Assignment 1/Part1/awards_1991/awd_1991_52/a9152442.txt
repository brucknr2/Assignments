Abstract    :
              This project is central to development of a new                                
              interdisciplinary course in global change for non-science                      
              students at Rhodes College.  The course is providing students                  
              with an understanding of the changes that are occurring that                   
              affect the Earth's environment, illustrating that the                          
              biosphere, atmosphere, hydrosphere and lithosphere all                         
              interact, on a global scale, to define this environment.                       
              Students are examining models, interpretations, measurements                   
              and physical principles used by scientists to study these                      
              global, interrelated problems.  This course and approach had                   
              been defined, over the last two years, by a group of university                
              and college scientists and educators who were selected and                     
              sponsored by the National Center for Atmospheric Research.                     
              Rhodes is the liberal arts college test-case for the concept.A                 
              major emphasis of the project involves the use of system                       
              modeling software, a powerful pedagogical technique, to aid                    
              students in understanding complex systems. Since the students                  
              are mainly non-science majors, time is spent during the first                  
              weeks of the course teaching use of the computers and modeling                 
              software.NSF grant funds are being matched with funds from non-                
              federal sources.
