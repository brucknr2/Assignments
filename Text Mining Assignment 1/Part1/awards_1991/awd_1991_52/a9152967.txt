Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to enhance the laboratory                          
              experiences available to advanced biology and psychology                       
              undergraduates participating in an interdisciplinary                           
              neuroscience program.  Laboratory exercises ranging from human                 
              electrophysiology to cellular neurochemistry will be possible                  
              with the acquisition of preamplifier isolation units coupled to                
              previously acquired MacLab data acquisition systems, a                         
              micropipette puller, micromanipulators and stimulus isolation                  
              units, chambers to hold brain slices, an electrochemical                       
              detector coupled to a previously acquired HPLC system, and a                   
              liquid scintillation counter.  The project also has                            
              implications for involving undergraduates in independent                       
              research.
