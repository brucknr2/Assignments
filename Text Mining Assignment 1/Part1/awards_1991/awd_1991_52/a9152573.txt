Abstract    :
              The project enables a major upgrade to the laboratory component                
              of the course Techniques of Radio Astronomy taken by junior and                
              senior undergraduates in the Five College Astronomy Department.                
              This effort is centered around the 21-cm horn antenna                          
              constructed for this laboratory some years ago; the present                    
              project allows the addition of a high resolution                               
              autocorrelation spectrometer for use in spectroscopic                          
              observations of hydrogen in the Milky Way.  This instrument has                
              replaced a low resolution filter spectrometer that had been on                 
              loan to this laboratory, but which was far from ideal and is no                
              longer available.  The autocorrelator is based on a 80386-                     
              personal computer, which takes the data and performs Fourier                   
              Transforms to obtain the spectral power distribution, as well                  
              as basic tasks such as calculating the direction in which the                  
              (manually operated) telescope is to be pointed.  The computer                  
              also runs the spectral line reduction software package                         
              developed at the Five College Radio Astronomy Observatory.                     
              After the period during which data are taken, the computer and                 
              software are available to students on an unscheduled basis,                    
              with several sets of laboratory exercises to be completed.                     
              These get students to go through the process of reducing their                 
              data after taking it.  Examples include determination of peak                  
              velocities at different Galactic longitudes to study Galactic                  
              rotation, and measurement of the basic form of the Galactic                    
              disk.  These projects greatly enhance the laboratory component                 
              of the course and thus the value of the course as a whole.
