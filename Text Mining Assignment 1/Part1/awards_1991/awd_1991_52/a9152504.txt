Abstract    :
              A revised bioengineering curriculum has been adopted that                      
              emphasizes the integration of introductory science with early                  
              engineering studies. An essential component of this curriculum                 
              is that each semester includes a laboratory course that will                   
              serve to integrate all aspects of the program.  The                            
              "workstation library" includes the necessary computational,                    
              data acquisition and data handling infrastructure needed to                    
              make operation of the new curriculum and laboratories feasible.                
              It includes hardware, in the form of 20 Unix-based workstations                
              integrated with the laboratory, the server that networks the                   
              workstations, and software for mathematical manipulation,                      
              simulation, and symbolic manipulation, as well as report                       
              preparation and presentation. The workstation network is                       
              accessible through the existing university computer network,                   
              allowing off-site access to the workstations. Laboratory                       
              instruments will also be accessed through the workstation                      
              network. The aim is to make the laboratory as essential and                    
              important a component of each student's learning and                           
              educational experience as are other information sources such as                
              libraries and texts.
