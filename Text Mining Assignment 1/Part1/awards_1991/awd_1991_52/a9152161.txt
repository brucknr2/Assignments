Abstract    :
              To prepare telecommunications technicians in the 1990's that                   
              have exposure to a wide variety of telecommunication and                       
              telecomputing techniques involving different types of                          
              transmission equipment, analog and digital instrumentation has                 
              been obtained to develop a telecommunications laboratory for                   
              the Telecommunications Technology program at Texas State                       
              Technical Institute - Sweetwater.   The three workstations in                  
              the laboratory provide training in noise measurement,                          
              multiplexing, signal analysis, signal encoding and decoding,                   
              frequency modulation technologies, and other technical                         
              applications.
