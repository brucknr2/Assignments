Abstract    :
              An electroanalyzer will give students experience in the use of                 
              modern electrochemical instrumentation.  Students in analytical                
              chemistry courses will use the instrument to perform a                         
              polarography experiment, a cyclic voltammetry experiment, and                  
              a coulometry experiment.  Students in an instrumentation course                
              will perform experiments in differential pulse polarography and                
              differential pulse anodic stripping voltammetry.  The grantee                  
              will match the NSF award from non-Federal sources.
