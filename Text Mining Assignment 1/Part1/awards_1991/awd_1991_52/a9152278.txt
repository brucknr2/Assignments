Abstract    :
              The focus of the proposed project is enhancement of the                        
              laboratory component of our Animal Physiology course (BIOL                     
              342), whose student clientele comprises juniors and seniors                    
              majoring in biology and/or seeking to fulfill entrance                         
              requirements for health-professional schools. The objectives of                
              this laboratory are: reinforcement of the classical                            
              physiological principles presented in lecture with hands-on                    
              experience; the practice of general, broadly applicable                        
              investigative skills; and the development of skill in the use                  
              of physiological methods and instruments. The aim of the                       
              project is to enhance our effectiveness in pursuing these                      
              objectives by exposing students to a greater variety of                        
              authentic investigative techniques and strategies, utilizing a                 
              greater variety of animal models and more sophisticated                        
              instrumentation. The major instruments we seek to purchase                     
              include oscilloscopes and digital storage modules for                          
              electrophysiological recordings from nerves; electrolyte and                   
              blood-gas analyzers for evaluation of renal and respiratory                    
              function; and an environmental chamber, oxygen analyzer, and                   
              temperature telemetry equipment for measuring metabolic                        
              responses to changes in temperature. We expect this project to                 
              intensely the interest of our students in organismal biology                   
              generally, to prepare them for subsequent independent                          
              investigative efforts, and to improve recruitment and retention                
              of majors in this curricular area.
