Abstract    :
              The Department of Geography is purchasing an X-ray sysyem and                  
              seismograph for use in a series of physical geography courses                  
              which emphasize the collection and analysis of data in both the                
              field and laboratory.  Activities include: mapping of bedrock                  
              river channel and an associated set of river terraces; mapping                 
              a delta island and collection of subsurface samples for soil                   
              and sediment stratigraphic analysis in the field; laboratory                   
              analysis of sediment, soil and microfaunal characteristics of                  
              a core sample from local wetlands.  The students are gaining an                
              appreciation for the rigors of field work and the importance of                
              accurate laboratory analysis while also developing confidence                  
              in their ability to pose and answer pertinent problems.
