Abstract    :
              The Department of Geology is purchasing microcomputers to                      
              integrate graphics information into geology.  The students are                 
              using the equipment with autotracing techniques to create and                  
              enhance contour maps and model subsurface geology in three                     
              dimensions. Undergraduate research students are utilizing the                  
              techniques to present graphical interpretations of geochemical
