Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is the improvement of the                             
              undergraduate biochemistry laboratories by providing                           
              opportunities for biochemistry majors, and majors in other life                
              sciences and secondary education to gain experience in the                     
              acquisition, analysis, and interpretation of data generated by                 
              modern methodologies.  UV-visible spectrophotometers interfaced                
              with computer systems are used for the analysis of                             
              thermodynamic and kinetic parameters of enzyme reactions.  The                 
              computers are also interfaced with HPLC systems for analysis of                
              peptide sequences and enzyme purification.  A centrifuge and                   
              microfuges are used in the preparation of membrane proteins,                   
              subcellular fractionation of tissues, metabolic regulation                     
              experiments, and in purification of RNA/DNA.  Fraction                         
              collectors are used in peptide sequencing and enzyme                           
              purification, and a vacuum concentrator is employed for peptide                
              analysis, protein characterization, and isolation of RNA/DNA.                  
              Gel electrophoresis equipment is used in the analysis of                       
              membrane proteins, in enzyme purification, in Western blotting,                
              and in Northern blotting of mRNA.
