Abstract    :
              The Department of Science is purchasing a 300 MHz FT-NMR with                  
              proton and carbon-13 capability and a variable temperature                     
              probe for use in a unified science program.  The instrument is                 
              permitting the completion of the implementation of a unique                    
              ultra-microscale organic laboratory.  Students are using l-D                   
              and 2-D 1H and 13C methods in the analysis of drugs in                         
              biochemistry, toxicology and criminalistics courses.  The                      
              instrument is also being used extensively in undergraduate                     
              research.
