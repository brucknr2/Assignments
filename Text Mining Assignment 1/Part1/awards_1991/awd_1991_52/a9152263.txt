Abstract    :
              The purpose of this project is to incorporate high technology                  
              surveying equipment into the civil engineering technology                      
              surveying classes and labs.  Acquisition of this equipment                     
              enables students to perform all surveying functions and hand                   
              calculations electronically.  Data is recorded by a data                       
              collector and students supply all field information to a                       
              computer, process all information, and develop a final drawing                 
              using CADD software.
