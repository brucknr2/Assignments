Abstract    :
              This project is intended to improve the quality of                             
              undergraduate instruction and research at all levels within our                
              program in Physiological Psychology.  Modernization of an                      
              existing advanced laboratory course in Physiological Psychology                
              is proposed which would provide students with invaluable "hands                
              on" experience with important concepts and methodologies                       
              through a series of demonstrations, interactive computer                       
              simulations and structured experiments.  Most laboratory                       
              exercises are designed around two "work-stations" composed of                  
              a microcomputer, interface and electrophysiological amplifiers.                
              This equipment, when combined with the other standard                          
              scientific apparatus detailed in the proposal, provide a modern                
              and highly flexible resource for laboratory instruction.                       
              Selected demonstrations and computer simulations developed in                  
              this context will be used to help students in lower-division                   
              Physiological Psychology courses better understand some of the                 
              dynamic aspects of physiology and behavior.  The resources                     
              requested would also dramatically improve the ability of                       
              undergraduates to gain meaningful independent research                         
              experience in Physiological Psychology.
