Abstract    :
              The purpose of this project is to provide undergraduate                        
              students With opportunities to work with a major and                           
              increasingly important scientific instrument and to explore the                
              methods of investigation and analysis that this instrument can                 
              support.  The instrument that will be purchased is a Bruker                    
              High Resolution Fourier transform 1H/13C & nuclear magnetic                    
              resonance spectrometer system.  This instrument will be used to                
              create contemporary examples of proton and carbon NMR spectra                  
              for use in the classroom teaching of organic chemistry, to                     
              analyze intermediates, products and unknowns in the                            
              undergraduate instructional organic laboratory, to present                     
              contemporary methods for the determination of molecular                        
              structure in the advanced organic chemistry course, to                         
              investigate enzyme-catalyzed reaction in biochemistry, and to                  
              provide opportunities for sophisticated experiments in the                     
              areas of structure determination, reaction mechanisms and                      
              kinetics for group projects and in student/faculty research.                   
              The project includes plans to make data, spectra, and other                    
              materials obtained with this instrument available to others who                
              do not have access to this type of equipment.
