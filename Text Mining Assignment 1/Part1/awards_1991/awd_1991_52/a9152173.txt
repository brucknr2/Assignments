Abstract    :
              The computer science program at Goucher College is implementing                
              a research component in the undergraduate curriculum.  An                      
              independent project is carried out with a faculty member in the                
              student's senior year.  The purpose of this project is to                      
              introduce our students to advanced computer science topics and                 
              to stimulate interest in research.  This project creates a                     
              multifunctional workstation laboratory which allow research                    
              activities in programming languages, artificial intelligence,                  
              computer graphics, and interdisciplinary work.  The laboratory                 
              is used for upper level computer science courses in these                      
              areas, and by seniors to carry out their research projects.
