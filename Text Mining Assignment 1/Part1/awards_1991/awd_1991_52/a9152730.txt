Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry is purchasing a gas chromatograph                  
              and a high-performance liquid chromatograph for use in both                    
              introductory and upper division courses. Students in the                       
              introductory courses are using the instruments to analyze                      
              commericial products such as over-the-counter analgesics,                      
              beverages, and plasticizers contained in PVC samples. Upper                    
              division students are investigating the sesquiterpene lactones                 
              found on plant leaf surfaces, herbicides in soil and tissue,                   
              and
