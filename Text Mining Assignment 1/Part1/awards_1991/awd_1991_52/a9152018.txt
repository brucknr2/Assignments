Abstract    :
              The project aims to improve the quality of undergraduate                       
              education in statistical methods, experimental psychology, and                 
              honors research by providing high-quality research and analysis                
              tools for student lab exercises and projects.  Nine                            
              microcomputers, one laser printer, 12 copies of a statistical                  
              software package, 10 copies of a run version of experimental                   
              psychology software, and three copies of a meta-analysis                       
              software package will be added to existing equipment and                       
              organized into four types of units: (a) 12 statistical analysis                
              stations for sophisticated univariate and multivariate                         
              analyses; (b) one experiment development unit with 26 prepared                 
              experiments and the capacity to create a wide range of                         
              experiments; (c) 12 experiment run stations for collecting data                
              from experiments created on the development unit; and (d) three                
              meta-analysis units for quantitative literature reviews.  The                  
              equipment would raise the quality of student activity in                       
              several courses, improve students' graduate training prospects,                
              and compensate for meager institutional computing resources.                   
              The department's success in attracting a large number of majors                
              (9%) and preparing almost half of them for graduate school                     
              (45%), in addition to the university's substantial percentages                 
              of women (64%) and minorities (30%; hispanics 17%), make this                  
              project very valuable.
