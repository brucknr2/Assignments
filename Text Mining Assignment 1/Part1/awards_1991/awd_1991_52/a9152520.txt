Abstract    :
              A multi-tool adaptor assembly for an existing commercial CGA                   
              robot and an additional small commercial high-speed robot are                  
              incorporated into the current robotic curriculum of the                        
              Engineering Technology Department.  These items of equipment                   
              are used in the laboratory experiments for courses in Robotic                  
              Fundamentals, Computer-Aided Manufacturing, Sensors and Vision                 
              Systems, Computer Integrated Manufacturing, and, on occasion,                  
              Special Problems.
