Abstract    :
              This project reshapes the curriculum and laboratory structure                  
              for the two-semester Introduction to Computer Science sequence.                
              Students explore the role of abstraction in both program                       
              development and reasoning about computation.  This change                      
              allows the course to play an important general-education role,                 
              letting non-computer-scientists sample the computer-science                    
              world view.  It also allows the prospective majors to gain an                  
              early perspective on the field.  To accomplish this change, the                
              Scheme dialect of Lisp, which better supports abstraction and                  
              exploratory  programming, is used which necessitates switching                 
              from personal computers to more powerful workstations.  To                     
              support this means of delivery, allow exploration of                           
              abstraction mechanisms, and allow empirical study of                           
              computational phenomena, the project uses 17 NeXTstation                       
              computer workstations and supporting file servers, printer, and                
              system software.  In order that the students have a positive,                  
              fruitful laboratory experience, the project also includes a                    
              switch to scheduled, structured, supervised lab sessions,                      
              rather than a drop-in computer room.
