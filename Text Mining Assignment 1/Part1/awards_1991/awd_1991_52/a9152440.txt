Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to create a learning environment in                
              which computers are used both as experimental and as                           
              instructional tools.  The laboratory experiments developed 1)                  
              permit students to run virtual experiments through the use of                  
              interactive animation, 2) learn to manage and control data                     
              acquisition systems, and 3) run simulations of biological,                     
              biochemical, and biophysical events.  Using Macintosh IIci                     
              computers, data acquisition hardware and LabVIEW 2, a unique                   
              graphic programming environment that can be used to develop                    
              data acquisition programs or simulations, students have the                    
              ability to devise innovative experiments directly on the                       
              computer.  Students given an experimental problem can, by                      
              interacting with the computer, control the path of an animated                 
              simulation and experimentally derive solutions to the problem.
