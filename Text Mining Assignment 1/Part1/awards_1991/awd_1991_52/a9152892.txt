Abstract    :
              The University of Washington is initiating a major program to                  
              improve entry-level science courses.  A major goal, as stated                  
              by the University Provost, is improvement of laboratory                        
              courses, and the requirement that all students enrolled in the                 
              lecture course shall also take the corresponding laboratory                    
              course.  The program in Physics is addressing both issues:                     
              improvement of thelaboratory courses, and preparing for                        
              increased laboratory enrollment.  The Physics plan begins with                 
              improvements in the mechanics laboratory experiments in                        
              introductory courses.  Faculty and staff who are participants                  
              in this project have been working for the past few years                       
              developing computer-based experiments that provide new                         
              opportunities for students to investigate motion in one and two                
              dimensions with much more accurate and versatile tools than                    
              were previously available.  The experience to date with lab                    
              sections where these experiments were tested shows that                        
              students are able to investigate a much wider range of                         
              phenomena with a deeper understanding of the concepts of                       
              motion.  NSF support is being utilized to match the University                 
              funds provided to purchase workstations (PC 386/SX) and two                    
              motion digitizing devices: a video system and optical encoders.                
              These elements are being integrated in a "motion measurement                   
              station" and form the backbone of a laboratory measurement and                 
              analysis system.NSF grant funds are being matched with funds                   
              from non-federal sources.
