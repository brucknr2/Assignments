Abstract    :
              The purpose of the proposed project is to acquire a total                      
              organic carbon analyzer to enhance the teaching of                             
              environmental measurements.  The instrument is used for a                      
              number of field and laboratory exercises, including the                        
              investigation of interrelationships between biochemical oxygen                 
              demand, chemical oxygen demand, total organic carbon, and                      
              theoretical oxygen demand; a ground water quality survey; a                    
              surface water quality survey; and the fate of total organic                    
              carbon as water passes through a drinking water treatment                      
              facility.
