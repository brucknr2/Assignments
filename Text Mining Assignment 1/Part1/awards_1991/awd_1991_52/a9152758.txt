Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to improve the curriculum by                       
              providing enhanced hands-on field and/or laboratory exercises                  
              in Introductory Biology, Ecology, lnvertebrate Zoology,                        
              Microbiology, Developmental Biology, Cell Physiology, Plant                    
              Systematics, Genetics and Evolution, and Marine Biology.  The                  
              purchase of a refrigerated marine aquaria and a freshwater                     
              table, environmental chambers, incubators, a sieve shaker and                  
              sieves, a plant dryer and herbarium case, and microvideo                       
              systems allow the incorporation of exercises such as isolation                 
              of microorganisms from marine sediments and soils, study of the                
              behavior of marine invertebrates in aquaria, the culture of                    
              cells and microorganisms, observation of developmental events                  
              in slime molds, yeasts and avian embryos, growth of short life                 
              cycle plants, and successful preparation of herbarium                          
              specimens.  Students benefit from the addition of field-                       
              collected and cultured live animals, plants and microorganisms                 
              to laboratory exercises, and the integration of field work with                
              laboratory exercises, and more organisms are available for                     
              student research projects.
