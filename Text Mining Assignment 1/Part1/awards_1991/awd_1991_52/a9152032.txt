Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to expose the students to                     
              advanced technology used in quantitative investigation of plant                
              hormone and secondary compounds in plants, problems in water                   
              relations in plants, and in the computer assisted monitoring of                
              plant growth.  Students learn the principles of chromatography                 
              using a gas chromatograph and conduct quantitative                             
              determinations of hormone concentrations in plant tissues under                
              varying conditions.  A water relations package gives students                  
              the opportunity to probe a field of science which is often                     
              neglected in most plant science classes due to a lack of                       
              equipment and expertise.  Computer and video digitization                      
              technology allow students to examine the factors that influence                
              both the rate and directional component of plant growth.  The                  
              equipment is used in courses taken by students majoring in the                 
              sciences and non-science majors, allow students to actively                    
              participate in self-designed independent student research                      
              projects.
