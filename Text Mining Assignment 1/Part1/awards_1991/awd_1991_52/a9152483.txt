Abstract    :
              This project supports enhancement of the undergraduate physics                 
              laboratory experience at the University of Delaware.  Equipment                
              is provided for improvement of the modern physics lab in the                   
              areas of optics and spectroscopy.  Direct laboratory experience                
              with modern equipment and measurement techniques is the focus                  
              of our revitalized laboratory sequence.  Current laser and                     
              spectroscopic techniques are well represented by the following                 
              light scattering experiments:  Photon counting and detector                    
              properties, Properties of photons (single photon interference,                 
              statistics, weak localization), Raman and Brillouin                            
              spectroscopy, Photon correlation spectroscopy (critical                        
              opalescence, Brownian motion), and Pulsed laser spectroscopy                   
              (dye lasers, time-resolved fluorescence).NSF grant funds are                   
              being matched with funds from non-federal sources.
