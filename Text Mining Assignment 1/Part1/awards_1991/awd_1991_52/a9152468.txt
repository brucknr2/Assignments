Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry is purchasing a 300 MHz FT-NMR for                 
              use in both lower and upper division chemistry and biology                     
              laboratory courses and for undergraduate research. Students in                 
              general chemistry are performing kinetic measurements, while                   
              their counterparts in introductory biology are studying in vivo                
              glycolysis by 13C NMR. Examples of upper division student use                  
              are investigations of enzyme stereoselectivity, and the                        
              structure of natural products by multiple pulse experiments.
