Abstract    :
              The acquisition of 8 computers and accompanying hardware and                   
              software will be used in the physiology laboratory to directly                 
              involve students in learning the basic principles of muscle,                   
              respiratory and cardiac physiology. Not only would such                        
              acquisition be a state of the art approach to the study of                     
              physiology, it would also allow for the direct participation of                
              every student in the science laboratory.  Students will also                   
              gain an appreciation for the use of computers in the collection                
              and analysis of experimental data.
