Abstract    :
              The project converts a printed circuit board-based                             
              manufacturing facility into a laboratory for the integrated                    
              design and manufacture of electronic products.  Specifically,                  
              the design content of this lab is expanded by considering the                  
              logical and physical design of the circuit, reliability                        
              analyses, manufacturing process design, and life-cycle costing.                
              In addition, the manufacturing content is expanded to encompass                
              activities such as CAM, quality and process control, and                       
              production control.  These educational objectives are obtained                 
              by adding design, analysis & control software, and material,                   
              mechanical and electrical testing hardware (to provide design                  
              and process feedback) to an already substantial equipment base.
