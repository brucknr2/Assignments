Abstract    :
              The project provides a comprehensive and challenging laboratory                
              experience in the areas of compressible flow, flow metering and                
              jet flows for mechanical engineering students.  The major                      
              equipment purchased includes an air-storage tank, a nozzle flow                
              apparatus, an electronic balance, two air blowers, and a                       
              computer data-acquisition system.  This equipment together with                
              the equipment on hand is used to perform experiments on                        
              pressure and mass flow measurements in supersonic nozzle flows,                
              thrust and flow patterns in nozzle flows, the Mach number                      
              measurement, differential pressure flow meters, and jet flows.                 
              The project strengthens the laboratory education in thermal                    
              sciences, introduces experiments concerning compressible air                   
              flow, and provides better opportunities for students in                        
              thermal-design classes and independent studies.
