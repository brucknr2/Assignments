Abstract    :
               Scanning Electron Microscopy for Undergraduate Student                        
              Research and Instruction in Biology Acquisition of a scanning                  
              electron microscope will enhance undergraduate education and                   
              research.  The senior capstone experience, independent research                
              investigations, Honors research, and selected laboratory                       
              courses will benefit from SEM capabilities. Our course                         
              offerings will now include a new course, Introduction to                       
              Scanning Electron Microscopy.  Problem-solving approaches will                 
              be emphasized in both student research and classroom/laboratory                
              investigations.  The departmental goals which will be advanced                 
              through SEM capabilities include: 1) the improvement of                        
              undergraduate education 2) the enhancement of student capstone                 
              and research experiences, 3) and further development of                        
              critical thinking, quantitative and analytical skills of                       
              students.  A critical point drier and a sputter coater with                    
              vacuum pump, essential for specimen preparation are also                       
              included in the request.
