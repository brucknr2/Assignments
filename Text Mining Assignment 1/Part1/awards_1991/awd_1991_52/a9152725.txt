Abstract    :
              The installation of a local area network, fairly powerful                      
              (windows-capable) microcomputers on the network, and                           
              appropriate software enables a significant improvement in the                  
              course on computing concepts taken by non-majors in computer                   
              science.  The course includes programming principles in                        
              practical (spreadsheet, database) settings which, with the                     
              upgrade, are becoming interwoven rather than disjoint, with the                
              students learning through their immersion in an enriched                       
              computing environment.  With computer-facilitated classroom                    
              conversations, use of e-mail, sharing of hardware and software                 
              resources on the network, and use of the windows interface for                 
              general software management, students use tools in an                          
              integrated, cooperative, and creative manner.  The new setting                 
              removes old obstacles to the study of computing principles                     
              (textual interface, awkward movement to get from one software                  
              environment to another, isolation of applications), and adds                   
              intriguing and engaging new features which stimulates such                     
              study.
