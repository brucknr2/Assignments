Abstract    :
              This award creates a multi-user and multi-tool computing                       
              environment that will enhance the teaching of computer science.                
              The equipment purchased is used to: 1) improve instruction in                  
              the existing curriculum; 2) develop upper level courses; such                  
              as computer graphics, database management and software                         
              engineering; 3) initiate undergraduate research by providing                   
              accessibility to other computer systems (on and off campus),                   
              scientific databases, and collaboration with researchers on                    
              this campus as well as at other institutions; 4) provide                       
              linkage to an existing computer science laboratory; and 5)                     
              provide a basis for network linkage with other universities,                   
              government, and industry.  The equipment is a Dec MicroVax 3300                
              server with eight workstations and two DECstations 2100 ULTRIX                 
              workstations networded together.
