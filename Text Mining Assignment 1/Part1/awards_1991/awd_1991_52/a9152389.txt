Abstract    :
              The incorporation of a 300 MHz Fourier transform nuclear                       
              magnetic resonance spectrometry will demonstrate to students                   
              the unique power of FT techniques in spectroscopic                             
              applications.  The theory and practice of NMR will be                          
              introduced in organic chemistry and advanced FT NMR topics and                 
              experiments in the instrumental analysis course.  FT NMR will                  
              also be included in the laboratory programs of all of the                      
              advanced courses.  New laboratory experiments will illustrate                  
              multinuclear resonance, homonuclear and heteronuclear                          
              correlation spectroscopy, relaxation phenomena, and variable                   
              temperature studies.  Advanced students will use the instrument                
              in undergraduate research, which will greatly strengthen the                   
              program.  The grantee will match the NSF award from non-federal                
              sources.
