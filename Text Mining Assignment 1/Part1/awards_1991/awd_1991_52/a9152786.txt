Abstract    :
              The Geology Department is purchasing equipment to capture                      
              polarizing microscope images for use by students in several                    
              undergraduate courses, including physical geology, mineralogy,                 
              petrology, economic geology and independent studies. This                      
              equipment will enhance teaching by allowing better                             
              communication of ideas and direct participation of students in                 
              the study of the properties of minerals in both thin and                       
              polished sections.
