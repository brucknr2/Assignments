Abstract    :
              The establishment of an instructional facility for plant                       
              biotechnology supports instructional modules, a plant cell and                 
              tissue culture course and undergraduate research.  The facility                
              is equipped with laminar air flow benches to provide sterile                   
              working space; illuminated incubators and incubator shakers for                
              maintaining strict control of light and temperature; an                        
              electroporation system that allows insertion of genes by making                
              protoplasts competent to take up DNA; and a peristaltic pump to                
              pump solutions past cells in student made bioreactors.                         
              Instruction stresses the development of both technical and                     
              problem solving skills.
