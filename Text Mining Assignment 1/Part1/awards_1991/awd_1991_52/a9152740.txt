Abstract    :
              The Department of Sociology, Queens College, The City                          
              University of New York will develop an undergraduate laboratory                
              using high speed microcomputers and an ethernet network. The                   
              network will be bridged to the Queens College Academic Computer                
              Center Network and from there to NYSERNET, the CUNY University-                
              wide Computer and NSFNET. This laboratory will permit the                      
              department to significantly enhance its curriculum at the                      
              introductory and advanced level.Three major objectives of the                  
              project are: 1) Infusing the content of lower level methods and                
              statistics courses with 'hands-on' laboratory exercises, thus                  
              upgrading the quantitative and scientific reasoning skills of                  
              students, especially those who major in sociology. Many of                     
              these students are women and many are members of racial and                    
              ethnic minorities. 2) Providing intensive independent research                 
              experiences for students considering scientific careers in                     
              sociology, through small laboratory-based upper level research                 
              courses closely supervised by senior faculty. Many students                    
              from the department have gone on to their Ph.D.s at graduate                   
              schools throughout the U.S. 3) Disseminating the results and                   
              products of our experience to other sociology and social                       
              science departments throughout the United States.
