Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry is purchasing an FT Infrared                       
              Spectrophotometer to develop a new series of undergraduate                     
              polymer chemistry laboratory experiments and enhance                           
              introductory and advanced organic chemistry laboratories. The                  
              instrument allows the introduction of a variety of modern                      
              laboratory experiments in physical, analytical and biological                  
              chemistry into the undergraduate curriculum. The instrument is                 
              also being used
