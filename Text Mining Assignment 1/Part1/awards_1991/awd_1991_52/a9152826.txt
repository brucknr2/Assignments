Abstract    :
              A laboratory for image processing and analysis is being                        
              established to train undergraduates in electrical engineering,                 
              computer science and the natural sciences in the analysis of                   
              natural images and scientific data. The lab consists of three                  
              networked computer workstations with specialized equipment and                 
              software for the acquisition and processing of digital images                  
              from photographs and video sources. This enables students to                   
              gain practical programming experience with scientific imaging                  
              topics like photometrics, two-dimensional signal processing,                   
              statistical pattern recognition, machine vision and parallel                   
              algorithms for multidimensional data processing and storage;                   
              these topics prepare students to apply and write software for                  
              increasingly important computer applications like biomedical                   
              imaging, remote sensing, robotics, and scientific                              
              visualization. To support the specialized hardware faculty are                 
              preparing a workbook of graded exercises based on a set of                     
              high-quality public domain image processing packages and data                  
              sets; this software and workbook can be freely disseminated,                   
              and run on a single inexpensive personal computer.NSF grant                    
              funds are being matched with funds from non-federal sources.
