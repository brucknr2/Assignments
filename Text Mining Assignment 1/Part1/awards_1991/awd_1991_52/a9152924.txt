Abstract    :
              The goal of this proposal is to improve undergraduate                          
              instruction in cell and molecular biology for freshman and for                 
              advanced biology majors, by placing more emphasis on cells and                 
              nucleic acids in the laboratory than on introductory chemical                  
              techniques.  The equipment includes an incubator, water baths,                 
              biosafety hood, and centrifuge for cell culture, and                           
              electrophoresis units, and spectrophotometer for studying                      
              nucleic acids and proteins.
