Abstract    :
              The Department of Geology and Geography is equipping a computer                
              graphics laboratory to support the teaching of a cluster of                    
              classes at all undergraduate levels in Physical Geography and                  
              Cartography. Students enrolled in science core curriculum                      
              classes in meteorology and climatology are using the equipment                 
              in conjunction with the reception and analysis of satellite                    
              weather data. Students in advanced classes use the laboratory                  
              in the study of data structutres, conversion between coordinate                
              systems,
