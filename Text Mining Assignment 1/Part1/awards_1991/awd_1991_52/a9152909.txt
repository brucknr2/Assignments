Abstract    :
              The goal of this proposal is to provide laboratory experience                  
              in molecular biology for upper level student majoring in                       
              biotechnology.  The requested equipment includes                               
              electrophoresis and slot blot apparati, micropipettors, and                    
              photodocumentation equipment, as well as micromanipulators and                 
              computer equipment, which are used in a course that exposes                    
              students to DNA and RNA analysis, DNA transfer into cells,                     
              micromanipulation and microinjection, and cDNA synthesis and                   
              cloning.  This equipment will also be used to expand                           
              opportunities for undergraduate research experiences.
