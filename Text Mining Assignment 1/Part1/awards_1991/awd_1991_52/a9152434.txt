Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry is purchasing a superspeed                         
              centrifuge and a scanning lifetime spectrofluorometer capable                  
              of both steady-state measurements and kinetic measurements in                  
              the 100 picosecond-1 microsecond time regime. The instruments                  
              are being used to introduce biophysical chemistry experiments                  
              into the laboratory portions of upper level chemistry courses                  
              and independent study projects. Included in the new curriculum                 
              is the study of inhibitor binding following isolation and                      
              fractionation of chloroplast membranes and fragments.
