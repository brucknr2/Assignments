Abstract    :
              The aim of this project is to significantly enhance the ability                
              to teach about respiration and metabolism in a diversity of                    
              biology courses.  The acquisition of a Micro-Oxymax computer-                  
              interfaced respirometer provides the sensitivity for measuring                 
              changes in CO2 as well as oxygen and allows animals to be                      
              monitored for extended periods of time without stress.  By                     
              interfacing with the university computing systems the collected                
              data is available to students in a variety of courses for                      
              additional analysis.  The project has an impact on students in                 
              several courses, allowing them to take direct, accurate                        
              measurements of key metabolic processes, to investigate the                    
              influence of various environmental factors on their magnitude,                 
              and to develop "doable" experimental ideas of their own.
