Abstract    :
              Southwestern College (SWC) is a primarily minority, public                     
              community college.  Through this grant the college is acquiring                
              computer-automated laboratory instrumentation that provides                    
              dynamic, modern laboratory experiences.  Existing physics lab                  
              equipment dates from the 1960's did not reflect the changed                    
              technology SWC students encounter in four-year transfer                        
              institutions and in the work place.The proposed equipment                      
              allows students to replace current lengthy manual data                         
              acquisition with automated instrumentation techniques, leaving                 
              time in the laboratory to explore the physical principles that                 
              incorporate the measurements.  This is a major shift in                        
              emphasis from the prior tedious, time-consuming measurement and                
              manual computation too often associated with physics.  The                     
              shift enables students to discover the excitement and joy of                   
              scientific inquiry and thought, helping to develop critical                    
              thinking skills.This project is part of the Physics Department                 
              Five-Year Plan, developed to achieve excellence within the                     
              Physics Department and thus increase the number of minority                    
              students who enter professional fields within science and                      
              engineering.  Equipment acquired includes IBM Computers and                    
              Interface Component Kits, Linear Motion Instrumentation, and                   
              Rotational Motion Instrumentation--all items making a complete                 
              package.  The equipment has direct impact on six of eleven core                
              experiments conducted in undergraduate physics courses by 450                  
              students per year.NSF grant funds are being matched with funds                 
              from non-federal sources.
