Abstract    :
              Understanding how science arrives at its conclusions is                        
              acknowledged to be of equal or greater importance than knowing                 
              a list of scientific facts.  This project develops an                          
              introductory course which concentrates on psychology as a                      
              laboratory science studying physiological and cognitive                        
              processes (a separate course already covers the social and                     
              applied areas of psychology).  A series of laboratory projects                 
              is used to organize and introduce the means and methods (as                    
              well as the results) of three of psychology's main divisions of                
              research: Physiological Processes, Sensation and Perceptual                    
              Processing, and Learning, Memory, and Cognition.  The addition                 
              of six computers allows students to participate as subjects and                
              experimenters (e.g. demonstration of iconic memory, the                        
              Sternberg task and working memory, semantic priming, etc.).                    
              Four of these computers are equipped with psychophysiological                  
              measurement modules for monitoring muscle activity, heart rate,                
              and skin conductance allowing students to reproduce basic                      
              psychophysiological phenomena (e.g. elicitation and habituation                
              of orienting, classical conditioning and modification of                       
              reflexes, etc.). This curriculum will prepare departmental                     
              majors for their required sequence of research courses and                     
              increase the scientific literacy of non-majors taking the                      
              course as an elective.
