Abstract    :
              The goal of this proposal is to provide the equipment needed to                
              teach new and innovative labs in introductory molecular and                    
              cellular biology. In collaboration with Dr.David Becker at                     
              Pomona College, new introductory biology labs that are designed                
              "to stimulate students" interest in science and to introduce                   
              them to the investigative nature of science are being                          
              developed.  All too often, introductory biology labs are simply                
              a series of "cookbook" labs that do not stimulate students'                    
              creativity or natural curiosity.  These boring labs, in                        
              association with lectures that stress memorizing facts, turn                   
              many students off to science.  These new labs first introduce                  
              students to basic concepts.  The students then design, perform,                
              and analyze their own experiments, building upon what they have                
              learned in class and in the course. The labs are designed in                   
              modular units of two to three weeks duration.  The first week                  
              or two of each lab module are devoted to exercises that teach                  
              the students the basic techniques and illustrate fundamental                   
              principles in this area.  The second and/or third weeks of a                   
              module, the students design and carry out their own                            
              experiments.  They then interpret their data and prepare a                     
              report.  As the term goes on, students will be encouraged to                   
              develop more and more sophisticated experiments.  This approach                
              to introductory biology labs should challenge students and                     
              introduce them to the excitement of scientific investigations.
