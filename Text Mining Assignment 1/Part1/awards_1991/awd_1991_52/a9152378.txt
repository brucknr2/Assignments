Abstract    :
              This project establishs a very-high-speed integrated circuit                   
              (VHSIC) testing laboratory for undergraduate electrical                        
              engineering students at the FAMU/FSU College of Engineering.                   
              This laboratory provides practical testing methodologies of                    
              VHSIC for senior-level students through a series of experiments                
              which cover the fundamentals of functional and parametric                      
              testing. The laboratory supplements the undergraduate                          
              Microelectronics Program which includes courses in solid-state                 
              devices, digital and analog IC design, and the computer aided-                 
              design (CAD) of very large scale integration (VLSI) circuits.                  
              With the new equipment, the students study the switching                       
              characteristics of high-speed microelectronic devices belonging                
              to logic families such as emitter-coupled logic (ECL), high-                   
              speed complementary-metal-oxide-semiconductor (HCMOS), and                     
              gallium arsenide (GaAs) metal-semiconductor field-effect                       
              transistors (MESFET). Electrical engineering majors completing                 
              the sequence of laboratory experiments gain a comprehensive                    
              knowledge of high-speed IC
