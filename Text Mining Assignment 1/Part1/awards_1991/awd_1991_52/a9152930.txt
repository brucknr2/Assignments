Abstract    :
              The Geography Department is equipping a laboratory with image                  
              processing and geography information systems for cartography.                  
              These increased capabilities are being used by undergraduates                  
              in both lower and upper division courses to integrate                          
              previously separate geographic activities. Mapping, surveying,                 
              digital remote sensing, and spatial analysis are now be carried                
              out in a common environment. Students are able to perform the                  
              algorithms they previously could only read about, to experiment                
              with different inputs, and to calculate the effects of                         
              different methods of spatial analysis.
