Abstract    :
              An expanded laboratory featuring Macintosh IIci computers                      
              running Mathematica is being used to implement a major revision                
              of the first-year calculus sequence.  First-year calculus now                  
              focuses more on powerful mathematical ideas and less on                        
              computational algorithms; some important topics, such as                       
              infinite series and differential equations, receive more                       
              emphasis; and the sophisticated software allows more                           
              experimentation and exploration.
