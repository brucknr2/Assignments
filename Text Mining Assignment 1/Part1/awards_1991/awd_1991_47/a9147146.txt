Abstract    :
                   The Advanced Steel Processing and Products Research Center at             
              Colorado School of Mines is an Industry/University Cooperative                 
              Research Center engaged in research related to the processing and              
              performance of advanced steels.  The research program covers sheet,            
              bar, plate and specialty steels.  The Center also provides an                  
              important forum for government laboratories like NIST, SERI, US                
              Army, etc., to interact with industrial laboratories and discuss               
              new technologies that might benefit producers and users of steel.              
                   This  award for $37,500 is part of a continuing award for                 
              three years totaling $117,500 for the Self-Sufficient Partnership              
              for Research Program initiation in the I/UCRC program.  The Program            
              Director recommends an award.
