Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award provides a share of "seed money" from the National                  
              Science Foundation, for the exploration and development of a                   
              technique to increase the sensitivity of the VLBA  recorders by a              
              factor of two.  This project is also being supported by other                  
              agencies in complementary fashion.
