Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The objective of this work is the use of the MU radar (49.5               
              MHz) in Kyoto, Japan, configured as an interferometer, to                      
              investigate those processes which appear to cause a "tilting"of                
              refractive index structures.  Such tilted layers produce                       
              differences in the measured vertical velocity using Doppler                    
              techniques.  By using the MU radar as both a Doppler device and an             
              interferometer, these thin scattering layers can be observed                   
              simultaneously thus producing independent measurements of the                  
              entire field of motion.
