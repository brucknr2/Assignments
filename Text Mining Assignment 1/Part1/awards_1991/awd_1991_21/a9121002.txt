Abstract    :
                   This project will examine the effect of coke and char in                  
              controlling slag foaming in steelmaking.  The slag must be                     
              maintained at a sufficient level to prevent excessive reaction of              
              the steel with the atmosphere and to provide a stable vehicle for              
              post combustion, but must be sufficiently permeable to reaction                
              gases venting from the melt to avoid explosions.  While                        
              understanding of foam production and maintenance has been largely              
              empirical in the past, the investigators have recently developed               
              fundamental understanding of the dependence of the foaming                     
              characteristics of the slag which depend only on the measurable                
              properties of the slag.  The effect of cake and coal char in                   
              controlling foaming, the effect of bubble size on foamability and              
              the foamed slags relevant to managanese smelting slags will be                 
              investigated.                                                                  
                   Effective control of slag formation would improve the                     
              productivity, competitiveness and safety of the US steel industry.             
              It may also make possible the development of direct steelmaking                
              from coal, eliminating the intermediate step of coke production.
