Abstract    :
                   This project is to assist The Mathematical Association of                 
              America (MAA) in the dissemination of the MAA's career                         
              information booklet, Mathematical Scientists at Work.  This                    
              projects helps to address the national agenda in mathematics and               
              sciences education by providing career information about the                   
              opportunities in the mathematical sciences.                                    
                   Mathematics has been characterized as the "invisible culture              
              of our age" within the general public; however, mathematical                   
              concepts and ideas are the underpinning of the technological                   
              environment in which we live.  It has been recognized that                     
              students are more likely to study mathematics when they (together              
              with their peers, parents, teachers, and counselors) recognize                 
              the career opportunities available in the mathematical sciences.
