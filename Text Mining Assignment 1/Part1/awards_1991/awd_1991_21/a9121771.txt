Abstract    :
                   This award is to purchase a high speed network testbed                    
              to support several projects at Purdue University including                     
              research in admission control of multimedia traffic for                        
              Broadband Integrated Services Digital Network (B-ISDN)                         
              technology, transient behavior in buffers in multimedia                        
              networks, synchronization protocols and prototyping of a                       
              broadband Distributed Multimedia Information System,                           
              heterogeneous distributed computing, and massively parallel                    
              numeric computation.  The network testbed will be implemented                  
              in collaboration with the TeraNet project at Columbia                          
              University's Center for Telecommunications Research                            
                                                                                             
              The proposed equipment will be used to implement a three-node                  
              TeraNet testbed in order to support various research projects                  
              related to Broadband Integrated Services Digital Network,                      
              distributed multimedia systems, parallel processing and                        
              distributed computing.  The equipment will be used in                          
              collaboration with the TeraNet project at Columbia                             
              University's Center for Telecommunications Research.//
