Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The phenomenon of "neglect" refers to the fact that following                  
              damage to one side of the cerebral cortex, there is a failure to               
              attend to the opposite side of the body and corresponding visual               
              space.  The sensory and motor deficits that result in neglect are              
              poorly understood and have not been adequately localized to                    
              specific cortical regions.  In this award, Dr. Mittleman will                  
              develop a model system for the separation of sensory from motor                
              deficits as well as for determining the relative involvement of                
              various cortical area in the phenomenon of neglect.  This research             
              will use behavioral paradigms involving the detection of visual                
              stimuli either by lateralized or by unlateralized motor responses              
              that enable a separation and quantification of sensory and motor               
              factors in sensorimotor neglect produced by cortical damage.  An               
              important result of these studies will be the assessment of the                
              relative contributions of individual ares of the cortex in                     
              sensorimotor neglect following cortical damage.  This research will            
              contribute fundamental knowledge about how the brain reacts to                 
              damage in specific areas.
