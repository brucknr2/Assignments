Abstract    :
                   This action funds an Interagency agreement between NSF and the            
              Bureau of the Census to support planning and development of the                
              1993 postcensal survey of college graduates.  This survey will                 
              collect information on education, training and employment related              
              to science and engineering from a nationally representative sample             
              of persons with bachelor's degrees (or higher).  These data are                
              used in NSF's Scientific and Technical Personnel Data System                   
              (STPDS).
