Abstract    :
              This is a proposal to purchase equipment for nucleic acid                      
              studies and for the purification and preparation of                            
              subcellular components.  The equipment will be applied to                      
              research topics including gene regulation in plants,                           
              translational regulation in spermatozoa, melanization in                       
              insects, phylogenetic relatedness of environmentally active                    
              soil bacteria, and the effect of deforestation on genetic                      
              variation in trees of tropical rainforests.  This equipment                    
              will also benefit undergraduate and graduate student                           
              training, as well as a Secondary School Educator Teacher                       
              Enhancement Program.
