Abstract    :
                   This award is to purchase a spot reading spectrometer, a 1-D              
              scanning rangefinder, and high quality color video camera to                   
              develop multispectral/multisensor systems laboratory for problems              
              in vision & electronic imaging.  Research projects using this                  
              system will include reflectance estimation & determination of                  
              material properties from reflectance; modeling & identification of             
              objects in a natural scene; development of morphological approaches            
              to processing multiband images for noise reduction & feature                   
              extraction; development of physics-based approaches to color image             
              enhancement; and development of methods for self-calibration of                
              electronic imaging systems.                                                    
                                                                                             
              Purdue University will purchase equipment to develop a new                     
              multispectral/multisensor systems laboratory for research in                   
              machine vision and electronic imaging.  The system will be used for            
              acquisition of high spatial resolution multispectral, color, and               
              range information from a model scene under controlled lighting                 
              conditions.  The researchers will be able to investigate a number              
              of important problems associated with image formation, image                   
              processing, and scene understanding.
