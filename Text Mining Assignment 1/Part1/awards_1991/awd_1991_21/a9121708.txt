Abstract    :
              In this project supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and                   
              Organometallic Chemistry Program, Dr. Louis H. Pignolet of the                 
              Chemistry Department, University of Minnesota, will investigate                
              the synthesis, reactivity and characterization of heteronuclear                
              cluster compounds containing platinum or palladium, and gold.                  
              New compounds that contain less than thirteen metal atoms and                  
              ligands such as isonitriles, alkyl phosphines, and halide ions                 
              will be synthesized.  In some cases a third metal, such as                     
              rhodium, osmium, or nickel, will also be introduced.  In                       
              addition, larger clusters containing more than thirteen metal                  
              atoms will be prepared.  Compounds will be characterized using                 
              some methods that that have not been exploited previously for                  
              clusters, including scanning tunneling microscopy and plasma                   
              desorption mass spectrometry.  Catalytic properties of the                     
              compounds will be tested, both under homogeneous and                           
              heterogeneous conditions.                                                      
              %%%                                                                            
              Discrete compounds containing a large number of metals and a                   
              mixture of metals are being investigated because of their                      
              potential catalytic applications.  They may serve as effective                 
              models for many commercial catalysts which are alloys, or                      
              mixtures of metals, or they may prove to be effective catalysts                
              themselves.
