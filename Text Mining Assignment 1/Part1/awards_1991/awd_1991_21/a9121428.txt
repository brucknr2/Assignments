Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Pseudo-random number generators are a critical component of many               
              computational techniques including algorithms based on Monte                   
              Carlo methods.  The emergence of parallel computers, particularly              
              MIMD systems capable of many independent calculations, requires                
              the development of parallel pseudo-random number generators if                 
              their range of applicability is to reach its full potential.                   
              This research will extend and generalize previous analytical                   
              results which represent generators for parallel processors.  In                
              parallel applications the correlations between generators on                   
              different processors are as important as correlations within a                 
              single sequential generator.  Promising generators will be tested              
              in an actual MIMD environment within a Monte Carlo calculation                 
              that solves the electronic structure Schrodinger equation for                  
              small clusters of helium atoms; however, effective generators                  
              will be useful in any parallel Monte Carlo calculation.
