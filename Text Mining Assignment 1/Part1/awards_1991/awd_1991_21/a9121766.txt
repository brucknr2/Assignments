Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Fundamental research to investigate the thermodynamic, kinetic                 
              and morphological stabilities of metal contacts to indium                      
              phosphide and to correlate the electrical behavior of selected                 
              InP/metal and intermetallic contacts in terms of their                         
              stabilities at the interfaces will be conducted.  The research is              
              of particular interest  for providing a sounder scientific basis               
              for the improvement--performance and reliability--of  ohmic                    
              contacts and Shottky barriers to compound semiconductor                        
              materials, and is considered critical to advanced electronics and              
              photonics science and technology.

              This research is expected to provide deeper fundamental                        
              understanding of basic properties of  metal interfaces to                      
              electronic/photonic materials.  From an application point of                   
              view, understanding these properties and their relationship to                 
              materials synthesis and processing is beneficial to semiconductor              
              device design and fabrication.  The results will be of importance              
              in a general way to the technology of large scale, high speed                  
              integrated electronic and photonic devices and circuits.
