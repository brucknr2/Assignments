Abstract    :
                   This award is for the purchase of equipment and                           
              accessories for testing VLSI analog and digital integrated                     
              circuits.  The research projects include design of novel,                      
              regenerative comparators, on-chip voltage generators, low-                     
              voltage, low-power OP amp for switch capacitor filters, and                    
              low power mixed-signal integrated circuits for biomedical                      
              applications.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              The equipment and accessories requested in this proposal will                  
              be used by the principal investigators and their students to                   
              test VLSI analog and digital integrated circuits for a                         
              variety of applications ranging from signal and image                          
              processing, to biomedical, space and mobile radio.  Their                      
              specific research topics are divided into the areas of                         
              digital signal processing integrated circuits, analog and                      
              mixed signal integrated circuits, and analog integrated                        
              circuit synthesis.
