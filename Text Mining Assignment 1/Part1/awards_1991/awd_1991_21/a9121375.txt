                                         ABSTRACT                                            
                                                                                             
                                                                                            
              The research described in this project is concerned with on-line               
              language comprehension processing during reading.  In the                      
              proposal, a number of studies are outlined in which eye movement               
              data are collected as subjects read sentences and text.  The goal              
              for the next period of research is to continue the empirical and               
              theoretical work on sentence parsing, syntactic ambiguity, and                 
              lexical ambiguity that has been done in our laboratory over the                
              past twelve years of this project.  The experiments deal with (1)              
              the role of focus structure in sentence and discourse processing,              
              (2) the role of events in sentence and discourse structure, and                
              (3) the effects of discourse structure on lexical processing.                  
              The theoretical implications of the work for a theory of reading               
              and on-line language processing will be developed.  The research               
              should be useful in furhter understanding the reading process and              
              help to reveal the relationship between skilled and poor reading.
