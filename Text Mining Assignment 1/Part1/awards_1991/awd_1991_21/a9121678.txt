Abstract    :
                   This Minority Research Initiation award supports the                      
              research in algebraic geometry of Professor Ronald Biggers of                  
              Kennesaw College.  Dr. Bigger's project is to make a computer-                 
              aided attack on a number of basic problems in the theory of                    
              moduli of algebraic curves.  The results that he aims for are of               
              considerable interest and importance in themselves, but a                      
              byproduct of his work will be a package of routines for computing              
              in group theory that will be of use to other mathematicians as                 
              well.                                                                          
                   This is research in the field of algebraic geometry, one of               
              the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one that has had a                 
              revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century.  In its                   
              origin, it treated figures that could be defined in the plane by               
              the simplest equations, namely polynomials.  Nowadays, the field               
              makes use of methods not only from algebra, but from analysis and              
              topology, and conversely is finding application in those fields                
              as well as in theoretical computer science and in robotics.
