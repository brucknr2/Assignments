Abstract    :
              This project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic                
              Chemistry program provides continued support for the research                  
              of William J. Evans of the Chemistry Department, University of                 
              California at Irvine, on the chemistry of organosamarium(II)                   
              compounds.  Attempts will be made to isolate an alkene in a                    
              cage created by a disamarium tetracyclopentadienyl cavity.                     
              Reactivity of cyclic monoalkenes and dienes will be tested.                    
              Coupling reactions of alkynide complexes of Sm(III) will be                    
              investigated, as will the details of the formation of the                      
              sterically crowded tris(pentamethylcyclopentadienyl)Sm                         
              compounds.  Further work will also be carried out on the                       
              recently characterized dinitrogen compounds, especially                        
              concerning cleavage of the N-N bond and its substitution and                   
              oxidation-reduction reactions.  The utility of samarium species                
              in formation of poly(main group element) ions will be tested as                
              will the promotion of reactions photochemically.                               
              %%%                                                                            
              This fundamental research project will explore the                             
              organometallic chemistry of samarium, a lanthanide metal.                      
              Research on samarium compounds of this type has been limited,                  
              so the goal of this work is to expand the range of reactivity                  
              known for such compounds and to determine some of the                          
              parameters affecting reaction mechanisms.  Not only have                       
              compounds with unusual structures been prepared, but they have                 
              also been found to participate in reactions which may have some                
              synthetic utility.
