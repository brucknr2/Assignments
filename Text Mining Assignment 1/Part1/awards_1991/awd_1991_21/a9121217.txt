Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A mechanism of endogenous growth suitable for investigation of                 
              sectoral or regional interaction is developed.  The effects on                 
              steady state growth of consumption and production linkages between             
              sectors are assessed, and it is shown how the high value placed on             
              production linkages by economic historians might be reconciled with            
              the high value placed on openness (often implying lack of linkages)            
              by observers of contemporary less developed countries.  It is also             
              shown how sectors or regions interact out of steady state through              
              both product and labor markets, and in particular how if the former            
              interaction dominates one sector can be an "engine of growth"                  
              pulling along the other, while if the latter interaction dominates             
              one sector or region booms while the other declines.                           
                                                                                             
              By building on these results it is shown why liberalization of                 
              foreign trade should lead to a transition from a lower to a higher             
              steady state growth rate and why, during the course of this                    
              transition, growth might initially be even slower than before                  
              liberalization.  On this basis a reinterpretation of the post-1973             
              economic performance of Chile is offered.  An application to                   
              economic integration of previously separate regions or countries               
              shows that the largest growth effects are to be had if one region              
              is allowed to decline and provide a source of cheap labor for the              
              other region.  This study would make an important contribution to              
              our understanding of sectoral or regional interaction in response              
              to economic integration during the growth process.
