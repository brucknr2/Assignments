Abstract    :
                   This award is to develop a state-of-the-art video                         
              acquisition, display, and processing laboratory to support a                   
              wide variety of research projects in video and image coding,                   
              image and multidimensional signal processing, and computer                     
              vision and image understanding.  The equipment will include a                  
              component digital video recorder and a high speed computer                     
              workstation.                                                                   
                                                                                             
              The next decade will almost certainly witness a rapid                          
              expansion of video and image related products and services                     
              that require compressed image and video data for transmission                  
              over band limited channels, or storage on band limited                         
              storage devices.  The bandwidth of broadcast video is very                     
              large therefore research on video compression and computer                     
              vision requires high speed digital acquisition and storage                     
              devices and fast computers to process, display, and analyze                    
              the digitized video signal.  Hence, Washington State                           
              University will establish a research laboratory with video                     
              acquisition, display and processing equipment that will                        
              support ongoing research efforts in video and image coding,                    
              computer vision, and image processing.
