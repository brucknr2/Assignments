Abstract    :
              Professor John Head is supported by a grant from the                           
              Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to perform                     
              theoretical studies of surface relaxation and reconstruction                   
              using a newly developed cluster embedding algorithm.  Surface                  
              geometries are frequently modified relative to the bulk                        
              properties by interaction with adsorbates.  The proposed                       
              embedded cluster calculations will treat clusters of a                         
              manageable size using standard Hartree Fock techniques while                   
              taking edge effects into account by using an extended basis set                
              defined for the embedded cluster space.  The equilibrium                       
              surface atom positions will be determined by minimizing the                    
              embedded cluster energy, while the computational effort of the                 
              minimization will be reduced by only evaluating a subset of the                
              cluster atom energy derivatives.                                               
              %%%                                                                            
              A number of important commercial processes depend on the                       
              detailed interaction of molecular species with surfaces.                       
              Examples include: intermetallic hydrogen storage, the initial                  
              stages of oxidation of metal surfaces, and heterogeneous                       
              catalysis.  All of these processes can benefit substantially                   
              from a better theoretical understanding of the interactions of                 
              molecular species with surfaces at the molecular level.  The                   
              techniques which will be developed by Professor Head will help                 
              to further elucidate these interactions.
