Abstract    :
                   This award is for the purchase of a Tektronix DAS 9200                    
              logic analyzer and DECstation 5000 workstation to support                      
              research and development of a high performance GaAs                            
              microcomputer system, implementation and evaluation of a                       
              distributed real-time fault-tolerant system, and studies on                    
              the interaction between operating systems and computer                         
              architecture.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              Microcomputer systems have enjoyed a performance increase of                   
              100% to 200% every three years.  Much of this increase of                      
              performance is due to the growth in chip integration.  The                     
              University of Michigan plans to develop a prototype "micro-                    
              supercomputer" that will achieve the best of both the                          
              supercomputer and microprocessor traditions by using a high-                   
              speed technology that has good integration density, and a                      
              state-of-the-art packaging technology to prevent chip-                         
              crossings from dominating the overall speed of the system.//
