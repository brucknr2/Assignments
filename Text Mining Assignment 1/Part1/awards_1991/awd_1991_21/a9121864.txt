Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award is being given to support student attendance at the                 
              Third Meeting of the Society for Research on Biological Rhythms to             
              be held in May 1992. The three-day meeting will include a plenary              
              lecture, symposia, workshops, slides presentations and poster                  
              presentations. Attendance will allow students to interact with                 
              senior researchers in the field. This type of interaction is an                
              important aspect of training of young scientists. Knowledge of                 
              biological rhythms is critical to understanding diurnal rhythms of             
              hormones and brain transmitters in humans as well as seasonal                  
              cyclicity in other animal species.
