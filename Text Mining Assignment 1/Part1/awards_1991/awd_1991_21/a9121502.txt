Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The University of Akron will host a major international conference             
              in July 1994, the Macromolecular Symposium of the International                
              Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry, which usually draws several               
              thousand scientists from all over the world.  This will be the                 
              first time in twelve years that this meeting will be held in the               
              United States.  The Organizing Committee has requested and will be             
              receiving from NSF partial support for the substantial presymposium            
              expenses, especially for printing and mailing of brochures to                  
              announce the meeting.  This symposium is first rate in quality and             
              importance to US polymer science.
