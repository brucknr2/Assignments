Abstract    :
              Enhancing research productivity is critical for many U.S.                      
              corporations as product life cycles continue to shorten and                    
              global competition intensifies.  This study begins an empirical                
              examination of research units' values concerning justice and the               
              development of new technologies.  The hypothesis is that                       
              employment relationships with the primary purpose of innovation                
              involve high transaction costs, because of the negotiating,                    
              monitoring, and enforcements needed to allow exchanges between                 
              parties to occur.  Shared values, specifically those concerning                
              justice, are critical in governing these relationships between                 
              researchers and employers.  This project will consist of indepth               
              field interviews of research and management personnel in eight                 
              biotechnology firms.  Interviews will be directed at exploring                 
              the respondents' perceptions of justice and of productivity in                 
              their research groups.  The investigators will publish their                   
              results in relevant journals, and develop plans for further                    
              research in this new and important area.  Results from this work               
              have both theoretical and practical interest.  The investigators               
              are well qualified; the research plan is good; the budget is very              
              reasonable; and the proposal is recommended for support with high              
              priority.
