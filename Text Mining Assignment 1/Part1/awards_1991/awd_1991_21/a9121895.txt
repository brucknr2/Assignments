Abstract    :
              This is an award to provide support for a symposium and                        
              workshop on results of research from projects supported by                     
              NSF relating to the diffusion, dispersion and interactions                     
              of pollutants in groundwater aquifers.  The objective of                       
              this conference is to provide the investigators who have                       
              conducted research supported by NSF on groundwater issues                      
              with a forum at which they can present their findings and                      
              have them subjected to review.  Discussion is expected to                      
              provide guidance for future directions in subsurface                           
              research that can be utilized by the research community in                     
              addressing needs.
