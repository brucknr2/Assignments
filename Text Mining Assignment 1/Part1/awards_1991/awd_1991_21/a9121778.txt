Abstract    :
              This project involves research on the design and semantics of                  
              statically-typed object-oriented programming languages.  The main              
              goals include:                                                                 
                                                                                             
              1.  The design of a statically typed, type-safe programming language           
                  supporting subtyping, inheritance, and information-hiding.                 
                                                                                             
              2.  Creation of a denotational semantics, including a mathematical             
                  model, of this language.                                                   
                                                                                             
              3.  The development of an axiomatic semantics for this language which          
                  will allow programmers to reason accurately about their programs.
