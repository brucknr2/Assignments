Abstract    :
              This project involves studies of sputtered multilayer films of spin            
              glass (SG) materials, typically CuMn-based SG alternating with                 
              (generally thicker) layers of a non-magnetic metal.  These samples             
              are used to study finite size effects, critical behavior, and                  
              dimensional cross-over (3d-2d) in both static and dynamic                      
              properties of SGs.  The work also includes anisotropic                         
              superconductivity studies when the non-magnetic metal is a                     
              superconductor.  An additional effort is devoted to investigations             
              of 1/f noise in SG ordering, and in a mesoscopic single crystal of             
              a semi-magnetic semiconducting SG.
