Abstract    :
              The Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program of the                     
              Chemistry Division is supporting a research project by Kenneth                 
              Jordan in which he is investigating the properties of small                    
              ionized clusters.  The work places special emphasis on problems                
              of charge localization in clusters, the characterization of                    
              temporary anions of clusters, the interaction between weakly                   
              coupled chromophores, and the computer simulation of cluster                   
              properties.  Effort is divided between the development and                     
              refinement of new techniques and use of the methods in                         
              applications to chemically important systems.  The sphere                      
              approach used for stabilization calculations on temporary                      
              anions is being pursued and effort made to improve the                         
              efficiency of the jump-walk/multiple histogram method for Monte                
              Carlo simulations.  The latter is to be used to study                          
              "solid-liquid" melting transitions in small water clusters.

              Theoretical chemists have made great progress in understanding                 
              and predicting the properties of matter in the gas phase, but                  
              have much more difficulty with solids.  One approach to the                    
              problem is to examine small clusters of molecules in which the                 
              intermolecular forces responsible for holding a solid together                 
              are manifested in a system with a relatively small number of                   
              particles.  This project is developing computational methods                   
              for investigating such clusters, with special emphasis on                      
              electrically charged clusters.
