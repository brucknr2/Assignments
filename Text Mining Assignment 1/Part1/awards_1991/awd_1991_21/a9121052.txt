Abstract    :
                   Computer simulation is used to gain a fundamental                         
              understanding of the physics of plasmas, to explore phenomena                  
              which are difficult or impossible to investigate in other ways                 
              and to study other potentially useful plasma behavior.                         
              Numerical techniques are developed to aid the study of these                   
              plasma processes and the results of the simulations applied to                 
              understanding real experimental configurations.
