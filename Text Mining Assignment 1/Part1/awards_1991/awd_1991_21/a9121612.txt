Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Current research and practice in production planning and control               
              is dominated by hierarchical, material requirements planning-                  
              based methods.  Despite advances in computer technology, little                
              real advance has occurred in the performance of U.S.                           
              manufacturing logistics management.  The objective of this                     
              project is to assess the merits of a major re-direction in the                 
              design of manufacturing planning systems which exploits computer               
              technology.  This project will test the relative performance of                
              two fundamentally different classes of manufacturing planning                  
              systems: Those that make no use of sequencing and scheduling                   
              information in the order release planning process, and those                   
              which use such information to determine order releases.                        
                                                                                             
              A computer simulation model of a general multi-item, multi-state               
              manufacturing system will be used to conduct controlled                        
              experiments for evaluating the relative performance of the two                 
              approaches as measured by a number of different criteria over a                
              wide range of operating environments.
