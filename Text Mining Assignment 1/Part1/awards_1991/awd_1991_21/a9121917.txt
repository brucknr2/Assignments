Abstract    :
              Surface diffusion on semiconductors is examined by direct                      
              imaging of adsorbate concentration profiles using surface                      
              second harmonic generation (SHG).  Work in the antimony on                     
              germanium (111) system has demonstrated that the SHG method                    
              avoids many of the problems associated with other methods,                     
              permits extraction of the coverage dependence of the                           
              diffusivity without paramaterization, and allows observation                   
              of the effects of ambient gas pressure on surface diffusion.                   
              The present effort focusses on III-V adsorbates (including                     
              gallium arsenide) on silicon and germanium.  Activation                        
              energies and preexponential factors for diffusion are measured                 
              as functions of surface concentration and of the density and                   
              orientation of surface steps.  The approach is also being                      
              extended to gaseous adsorbates such as triethylgallium.  The                   
              effects of various factors on diffusion are examined; these                    
              include photon flux, electric fields directed parallel to the                  
              surface, and ambient noble gases.                                              
                                                                                             
              Surface diffusion often has a primary role in governing the                    
              rates of surface reactions, particularly for those involved in                 
              the formation of thin films of semiconductors by chemical                      
              vapor deposition or molecular beam epitaxy.  Control of the                    
              process and of the quality of the product are hampered by a                    
              lack of data on surface diffusion.  This research produces an                  
              efficient and general methodology for obtaining such                           
              information.
