Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award is for the renewal of the Materials Research Group at               
              Case Western University on the topic of low pressure growth of                 
              diamond and diamond-like materials.  The principal experimental                
              program areas are: (1) studies of the nucleation and growth of                 
              diamond and diamond-like materials including the nature of the                 
              molecular precursors, the origin and role of defects during growth,            
              and heteroepitaxial growth,  (2) fundamental structural and                    
              property measurements including mechanical properties, transport               
              properties, influence of doping and hydrogen.  The theoretical                 
              studies include: (1) molecular orbital studies of nucleation and               
              growth,  (2) electronic structure calculations of interfaces and               
              surfaces,  (3) Monte Carlo computer modelling of growth, and  (4)              
              reactor modelling.  The diamond and diamond-like films are                     
              characterized using ion beam analysis, electron microscopy, Fourier            
              transform nuclear magnetic resonance, Fourier transform infrared               
              spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction, and Raman scattering.  The                    
              experimental and theoretical efforts are highly interactive.
