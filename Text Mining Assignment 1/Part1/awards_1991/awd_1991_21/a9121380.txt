Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program                 
              will help the Department of Chemistry at North Carolina State                  
              University acquire a 300 MHz NMR spectrometer which will be                    
              used in research investigations in the following areas of                      
              chemistry:                                                                     
                                                                                             
                (1)  The synthesis of natural products and biologically                      
                     active compounds using chiral auxiliary mediated                        
                     asymmetric synthesis;                                                   
                (2)  The generation and reactions of nucleophilic capped                     
                     1,3-dipole equivalents to carbonyl ylides;                              
                (3)  The competition between electron donation and withdrawal                
                     in fluoro- and methoxyketones;                                          
                (4)  Theoretical and synthetic aspects of the rapidly                        
                     expanding field of organofluorine chemistry;                            
                (5)  The incorporation of fluorine atoms into organic                        
                     molecules by devising new approaches to synthesize                      
                     selectively fluorinated organic compounds;                              
                (6)  Organo-analytical chemistry.                                            
                                                                                             
              Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy is the most                      
              powerful tool available to the chemist for the elucidation of                  
              the structure of molecules.  It is used to identify unknown                    
              substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within                 
              molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between                   
              molecules in solution.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR                         
              spectroscopy is essential to chemists who are carrying out                     
              frontier research.  The results from these NMR studies are                     
              useful in areas such as polymers and catalysis, and in biology.
