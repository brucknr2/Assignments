Abstract    :
                   This award is to purchase a workstation, video                            
              production hardware and software to support research in areas                  
              of analysis and presentation of experimental fluid and                         
              granular flow, visualization and mathematical analysis of                      
              pattern formations and spatiotemporal chaos in large domains,                  
              visualization of solid modeling, and photorealistic animation                  
              of chemical reactions on surfaces.                                             
                                                                                             
              The effectiveness of large-scale numerical simulation                          
              problems in computer science and the natural sciences are                      
              dependent on high-speed computation and increasingly                           
              sophisticated visualization techniques.  Duke University will                  
              be establishing a high-quality facility for the support of                     
              scientific visualization with emphasis on computer animation,                  
              for use by faculty in computer science and the natural                         
              sciences.
