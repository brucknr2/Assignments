Abstract    :
                   The objective of this research is to develop methods and tools            
              for analyzing the information flow between engineering tasks in                
              order to plan and manage design strategies.  The work is based on              
              the concept of a Design Structure Matrix that allows for explicit              
              representation of predecessor-successor relations between design               
              tasks.                                                                         
                   This effort extends work on "tearing methods", or the                     
              elimination of circuits in Design Structure Matrices, to allow for             
              configuration control as well as design planning.  These concepts              
              are expected to play a significant role in the development of                  
              concurrent design methodologies and their extension to industrial              
              environment.
