Abstract    :
              In this program sponsored by the experimental physical                         
              chemistry in the Chemistry Division, the Hedberg husband and                   
              wife team (Oregon State University) will conduct structure                     
              determinations using gas phase electron diffraction at high                    
              temperatures. The development of high temperature apparatus                    
              allows the Hedbergs to study relatively nonvolatile materials                  
              such as C60 and higher members of the fullerene allotropes of                  
              carbon.                                                                        
              %%%                                                                            
              Buckminsterfullerene, a compound containing only carbon atoms                  
              arranged like a soccer ball, has received widespread attention                 
              because of its unique structure and the potentially valuable                   
              properties of its derivatives (high temperature                                
              superconductivity, substrate for diamond synthesis). The                       
              Hedbergs (Oregon State University) provided the first gas phase                
              structure determination of the parent compound, and will extend                
              their studies to the burdgeoning class of chemically important                 
              higher members of the fullerene series.
