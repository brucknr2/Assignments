Abstract    :
                   This project supports research on a number of problems                    
              concerning the arithmetic geometry of curves and surfaces, as well             
              as possible higher-dimensional generalizations.  The research                  
              involves a detailed study of K3 surfaces with infinite automorphism            
              group, centered around the canonical heights defined on such                   
              surfaces.  The project will study the variation of the p-adic                  
              height on elliptic surfaces, extending recent results for the                  
              classical height, with possible applications to L-series.  The                 
              research will also involve the study of various general position               
              theorems in algebraic geometry, quantitative bounds for the number             
              of rational points on curves of genus at least two, and the                    
              development of a new algorithm for computing canonical heights on              
              elliptic curves which does not require a complete factorization of             
              the discriminant.                                                              
                   This project is in the general area of number theory and                  
              algebraic geometry.  This is an area of research that focuses on               
              the solutions sets, which are curves or surfaces in lower                      
              dimensions, of families of algebraic polynomials.
