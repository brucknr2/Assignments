Abstract    :
              This project will investigate the role of active oxygen in                     
              restricting pathogenesis by the plant pathogenic bacterium                     
              Pseudomonas syringae.  The hypothesis that the pathogenic                      
              Pseudomonads are able to reduce plant-imposed oxidative stress                 
              during pathogenesis though an arsenal of catalase isozymes will be             
              tested.  There are two portions to the project: 1) cloning of the              
              genes for the catalase isozymes and construction of mutants for                
              virulence studies; and 2) determination of the interactions of the             
              various catalase genes with the hrp genes that appear to control               
              the pathogenicity of the bacterium.  The genetic part will be                  
              carried out by Dr. Hutcheson at the University of Maryland, while              
              biochemical and physiological studies will be carried out by Dr.               
              Klotz at Utah State University under another award.

              This research will contribute to the understanding of the initial              
              events that occur during plant-microbe interactions, and should                
              provide new information on the fundamental differences between                 
              microbes that causes plant disease and those which cannot.
