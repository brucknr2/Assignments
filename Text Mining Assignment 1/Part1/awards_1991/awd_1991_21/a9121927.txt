Abstract    :
                   This award is for the purchase of a file server and disk                  
              storage for research in automatic language identification,                     
              continuous letter recognition, telephone speech recognition                    
              and stochastic dynamics of neural learning.  These research                    
              projects require frequent and repeated use of large amounts                    
              of data.  The file server will be able to handle a large                       
              number of disks and heavy network traffic, and the disk                        
              storage will satisfy current storage needs.                                    
                                                                                             
              Network transfers of very large files used to train neural                     
              network classifiers can seriously strain an institution's                      
              disk/cpu server.  The requested file server and disk storage                   
              will allow the Oregon Graduate Institute to handle a large                     
              number of disks and very heavy network traffic.  The                           
              additional disk storage will satisfy current storage needs.
