Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry at Harvey Mudd College, which is a                 
              small undergraduate institution, will use this award from the                  
              Chemical Research Instrumentation Program to help acquire a                    
              Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer.  The areas of                  
              chemical research that will be enhanced by the acquisition                     
              include the following:                                                         
                                                                                             
              1.  The activation and reactions of nitrous oxide, reactions                   
                  of metal nitrosyl compounds with nitric oxide and oxygen,                  
                  and reductive denitrosylation reactions.                                   
                                                                                             
              2.  The study of structures of assembled monolayers at                         
                  surfaces.                                                                  
              %%%                                                                            
              Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy is a technique                  
              that uses absorption of infrared energy to probe molecular                     
              structure.  When used in conjunction with a modern computer,                   
              FTIR studies on large numbers of samples can be conveniently                   
              carried out and the resulting data readily analyzed.  The use                  
              of FTIR spectroscopy is essential to chemists who are carrying                 
              out research in many important frontier areas.
