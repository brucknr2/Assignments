Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This U.S.-Hungary research project between Dr. Gabor T. Herman                 
              of the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine  and Dr.                  
              Attila Kuba of Kalmar Laboratory of Cybernetics, Jozsef Attila                 
              University, Szeged, Hungary, has the long-term objective to                    
              develop computational and mathematical procedures for the                      
              reconstruction of internal structures in a body from data collected            
              by detectors (sensitive to some sort of energy) outside of the body            
              and for the visualization and analysis of information contained in             
              these reconstructions.  These procedures are applicable in many                
              areas of science and engineering, including:  neuroscience, medical            
              imaging, industrial inspection, geoscience, astronomy, and fluid               
              dynamics.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              This project in radiology fulfills the program objective of                    
              advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the              
              United States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary                      
              talents and pool resources in areas of strong mutual interest and              
              competence.
