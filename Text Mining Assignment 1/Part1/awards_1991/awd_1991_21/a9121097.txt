Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Vasopressin is a neuropeptide that functions as a chemical                     
              messenger in the brain.  It has been shown to be involved in                   
              regulating a number of behaviors, including aggression,                        
              reproduction, communication and learning and memory.  Dr. Ferris               
              has focused his efforts on the relationship between vasopressin                
              and communicative behaviors.  He has identified the                            
              neuroanatomical sites where vasopressin acts to mediate the                    
              behavior.  Thus, Dr. Ferris has developed a excellent model for                
              studying the neural circuitry of a defined behavior.  Recognizing              
              that this neuropeptide system goes through progressive changes                 
              during development, Dr. Ferris will now correlate the ontogeny of              
              vasopressin cell bodies and vasopressin receptors with the                     
              ontogeny of the communicative and aggressive behaviors.  In                    
              addition, he will examine the interaction between                              
              glucocorticoids, a family of steroid hormones secreted by the                  
              adrenal under stressful conditions, and the vasopressin system in              
              the brain.  These studies will determine whether stress during                 
              early life can have permanent effects on the brain which can                   
              alter behavior in adulthood.
