Abstract    :
                   This award is for the purchase of a 32-node nCUBE-2                       
              multicomputer to support research in parallel computing.                       
              Projects include the investigation of multicast communication                  
              in multicomputers, parallel numerical algorithms and software                  
              support, a simulation environment based on shared workstation                  
              capacity, and contention in wormhole-routed multicomputers.                    
                                                                                             
              Michigan State University plans to purchase an nCUBE-2                         
              multicomputer in order to support research in parallel                         
              computing.  Multicast communication is finding increasing                      
              demand in parallel applications including simulations, search                  
              algorithms, and numerical algorithms.  Research projects                       
              using the nCUBE will include studies of hardware support for                   
              multicast communication, parallel numerical algorithms with a                  
              focus on steady state solutions of power flow equations, the                   
              development and evaluation of a simulation environment based                   
              on the sharing of capacity from privately owned workstations,                  
              and the investigation of contention and mapping problems on                    
              wormhole routing multicomputers.
