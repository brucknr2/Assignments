Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The goal of the research to be performed by Dr. Murphey is to                  
              understand how synapses are stabilized during synaptic                         
              rearrangement in the nervous system.  The synaptic assembly process            
              is a dynamic one involving both the pre- and post synaptic cells.              
              During the previous funding period, Dr. Murphey gathered remarkable            
              results suggesting that the strength and short term plasticity of              
              synapses can be controlled by the postsynaptic cell.  Dr. Murphey              
              will now concentrate his studies on the role of the postsynaptic               
              cell in the process of synapse assembly.  He will utilize                      
              electrophysiological techniques to describe short and long term                
              plasticity at synapses that are constantly being altered.  In                  
              addition, pharmacological tools will be used to block neurogenisis             
              or neural activity in an effort to explore the mechanisms                      
              underlying synapse stabilization and destabilization.  Finally, Dr.            
              Murphey will use computational tools to explore the consequences               
              of synaptic rearrangement for circuit function.  Results obtained              
              from this study will add significantly to our knowledge of what                
              interactions are involved in the assembly of synapses.***
