Abstract    :
                   This grant supports a workshop to study human resource                    
              issues in computer science and technology.  At the workshop                    
              some of the issues to be addressed are: what is known about                    
              the existing labor market?  What are the strengths and                         
              weaknesses of existing data collection systems?  How will                      
              industry growth, workforce attrition and labor supply                          
              interact during the next decade?  How are computer                             
              specialists currently trained?  How should their training be                   
              altered to meet future needs?  A steering committee will be                    
              established, a workshop conducted, and a final report will be                  
              prepared.//
