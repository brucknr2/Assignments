Abstract    :
              A large data base will be compiled from all data available on radon            
              levels in U.S. homes.  It is expected that this will give                      
              reasonably accurate mean radon levels, r, in about 2000 U.S.                   
              counties.  These will then be correlated with lung cancer rates, m,            
              and numerous socioeconomic variables for these counties to test the            
              predictions of linear-no threshold theory for the dependence of m              
              on r.  Basic problems and limitations of this type of analysis, and            
              of ecological studies in general will be investigated using a                  
              variety of models.  Effects of random errors in these data will be             
              explored.  A large case-control study of the radon-lung cancer                 
              relationship will be completed.  When conclusions are reached on               
              the measured dose-response relationship between radon and lung                 
              cancer, explanations for, and consquences of, this relationship                
              will be explored.
