Abstract    :
                   This award is to purchase a color stereo head mounted on                  
              a robot arm, high performance graphics workstations, and                       
              cameras in order to support investigations in the use of                       
              color algorithms in model based vision; algorithms for                         
              machine stereopsis; applications of invariant theory in
