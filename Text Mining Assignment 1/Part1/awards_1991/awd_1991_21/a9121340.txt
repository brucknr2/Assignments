Abstract    :
                   Partial support is provided for the Mid-Atlantic                          
              Mathematical Logic Seminar.  MAMLS was formed in the fall of 1982.             
              It has been running three or four meetings a year under the primary            
              supervision of Lee Stanley since that time.  Four meetings per year            
              are projected for the next three years,                                        
              including some meetings held jointly with other organizations.                 
                The seminar covers a broad spectrum of mathematical logic with               
              particular emphasis on complexity theory, theoretical computer                 
              science, fragments of arithmetic, pure and applied model theory,               
              set theory, subsystems of analysis in accordance with the                      
              program of H. Friedman and S. Simpson, and topos theory.                       
                   Support is provided primarily for outside speakers.                       
              Supportis also provided for travel expenses of graduate students               
              and other regular seminar participants not supported by other                  
              grants, and for incidental expenses associated with organizing and             
              running the seminar, notably mailing costs (copying and postage).              
                   MAMLS was supported by NSF in 1984-1985 through a                         
              supplement to Lee J. Stanley's grant MCS 8201042 at Lehigh                     
              University, in 1985-1987 under grant DMS 8506058, in 1987-1989                 
              through grant DMS 8704751, and since 1989 under grant DMS 8907348,             
              all to Lehigh University with Lee J. Stanley as project director.
