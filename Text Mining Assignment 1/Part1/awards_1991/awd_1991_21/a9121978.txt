Abstract    :
                   This award is for the purchase of a Stereolithography                     
              rapid prototyping machine and necessary accessories.  Rapid                    
              prototyping technology provides a means of quickly producing                   
              prototypes directly from a Computer Aided Design (CAD)                         
              representation.  The proposed equipment will be used to                        
              support research projects with emphasis on rapid prototyping                   
              using concurrent computational geometric modeling and                          
              information transfer, and CAD-based interactive graphic                        
              modification and automatic verification of 3-D objects using                   
              complete 3-D laser scanning data.                                              
                                                                                             
              Rapid prototyping can shorten product lifecycle and improve                    
              the design process by providing rapid and effective feedback                   
              to the designer.  North Carolina State University will be                      
              purchasing a Stereolithography rapid prototyping machine and                   
              necessary accessories to support research in the areas of                      
              concurrent computational geometric modeling and information                    
              transfer.//
