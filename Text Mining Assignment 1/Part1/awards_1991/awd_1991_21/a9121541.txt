Abstract    :
              Flanagan         High-quality sound pick up in enclosures, such as meeting 
              rooms and auditoria, is central to effective teleconferencing by  large groups
              separated by distance.  The basic goal of this  research is the exploration of
              the potential of using sensors in  3D configurations to achieve spatial volume
              selectivity, and  hence, high quality sound pick up comparable to that enjoyed
              when  the speakers are face-to-face in the same room.  Both beamforming  and
              matched field processing are being examined, with detailed  computer studies
              preceding measurements, and experiments in real  rooms.
