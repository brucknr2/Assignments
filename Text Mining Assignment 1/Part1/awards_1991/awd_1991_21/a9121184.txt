Abstract    :
              This proposal is for support of student travel to the                          
              35th International Symposium on Electron, Ion and                              
              Photon Beams, in Seattle, Washington, May 28-31,                               
              1991.  The symposium will cover the latest research                            
              results in the fields of nanofabrication,                                      
              microfabrication, electron and ion lithographies, x-                           
              ray lithography, particle beam optics, and forefront                           
              applications of nanofabrication.  At this conference                           
              the latest research from groups around the world
