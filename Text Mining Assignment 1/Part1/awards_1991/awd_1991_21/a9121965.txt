Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will support a two-year U.S.-Japan Cooperative                      
              Photoconversion/Photosynthesis Research Program project between                
              Professor Ronald Christensen, Department of Chemistry, Bowdoin                 
              College, Brunswick, Maine, and Professor Keitaro Yoshihara,                    
              Department of Electronic Structure, Institute for Molecular                    
              Science, Okazaki, Japan.  The collaboration will focus on the                  
              spectroscopy and dynamics of the S1 and S2 excited states of                   
              simple tetraenes and trienes in supersonic molecular beams.  The               
              goal is to obtain a more detailed understanding of                             
              photoisomerization in phototypical polyene systems.                            
                                                                                             
              This project to study the electronic spectra of polyenes involves              
              cooperative experiments between scientists with complementary                  
              skills and facilities.  Their studies using fluorescence and                   
              fluorescence excitation techniques promise to make substantial                 
              contributions to ongoing research and will complement other                    
              methods based on multiphoton ionization.  Professor Christensen                
              will travel to Okazaki to purify his compounds there and will                  
              participate in the conduct and interpretation of the spectroscopic             
              experiments.
