Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award funds the compilation of a catalog of dwarf galaxies,               
              identified on photographic plates originally taken for studies of              
              bright galaxies.  Studies of this material will explore the                    
              possibility of utilizing associations of dwarf galaxies with giant             
              galaxies to obtain a method to measure distances to the galaxy                 
              pairs.  It will also permit constraints to be placed on models of              
              the formation of dwarf and giant galaxies, and of their subsequent             
              evolution.
