Abstract    :
              For Einstein, principles of covariance were the essence of his                 
              special and general theories of relativity (1905 and 1915).  They              
              embodied the advances made by the theories.  The transition from an            
              aether theory with an absolute state of rest to special relativity             
              was effected through the requirement that the laws of special                  
              relativity must be covariant under Lorentz transformation.  Since              
              the Lorentz covariance of special relativity mapped inertial frames            
              of reference onto inertial frames of reference, the Lorentz                    
              covariance of special relativity, as presented in Einstein's                   
              celebrated 1905 paper, was sufficient to guarantee that the theory             
              satisfied the principle of relativity of inertial motion.  Dr.                 
              Norton is examining the history and development of principles of               
              covariance in relativity theory and their connection with                      
              relativity principles, Mach's principle and the principle of                   
              equivalence.  He is considering how the ideas in this whole area               
              have developed since Einstein's time and is tracing how the now                
              standard modern view has come to disagree almost completely with               
              Einstein's own view--the view universally celebrated 70 years ago.             
              This study promises to present historians, philosophers and                    
              physicists with a synoptic view of the tangled and confusing                   
              developments of one of the most important problems in foundations              
              space and time theory.
