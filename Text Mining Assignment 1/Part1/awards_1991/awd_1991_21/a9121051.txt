Abstract    :
                   This project will research some basic and important areas                 
              in cryptography and theoretical computer science that have                     
              significant interaction with combinatorics, in particular,                     
              secrecy and authentication codes, secret-sharing schemes and                   
              universal hashing.  Informally, a secrecy code is used in                      
              order to keep the contents of message secret, while an                         
              authentication code is used to ensure the "integrity" of a                     
              message, i.e. that the message has not been tampered with.                     
              Threshold schemes and secret-sharing schemes were introduced                   
              to handle problems such as key distribution and shared control                 
              of jointly initiated events.  Universal hashing is a technique                 
              to ensure good average-case behaviour of hash function, and                    
              has applications in diverse areas of theoretical computer                      
              science, including cryptography.                                               
                   New constructions and algorithms will be investigated for                 
              these types of cryptographic protocols.  The problems to be                    
              researched include:  construction of optimal codes for                         
              authentication and secrecy and construction of codes which                     
              permit arbitration; construction of secret-sharing schemes for                 
              general access structures and efficient implementations of                     
              these codes; and constructions and bounds for universal                        
              classes of hash function.  All of these questions involve                      
              combinatorial designs in a fundamental way, both in                            
              constructions and in characterizations.
