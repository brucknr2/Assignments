Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                                         ABSTRACT                                            
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
                  The investigators will carry out research on the locality                 
              conditions applying to bound anaphora.  The primary, though not                
              the sole, focus of the study will be on contrasting properties of              
              long-distance and local reflexives across languages by examining               
              the characteristics of reflexives in a wide variety of languages.              
              In addition to locality conditions, the study will investigate                 
              such related topics as the putative "subject-orientation" of                   
              long-distance bound anaphora.                                                  
                                                                                             
                   While the investigators will conduct the study within the                 
              framework of Government and Binding Theory, the major emphasis of              
              the study will be empirical in nature: the determination of the                
              range of facts related to reflexives crosslinguistically.  The                 
              initial hypothesis is that despite appearances, reflexives obey                
              the same locality conditions in all languages: Apparent long                   
              distance reflexives involve local successive cyclic movements.                 
              The investigators will test the empirical adequacy of this                     
              proposal and compare its empirical consequences with other                     
              current proposals such as feature percolation and the expansion                
              of governing categories.
