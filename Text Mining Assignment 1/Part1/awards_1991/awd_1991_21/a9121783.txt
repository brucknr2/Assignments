Abstract    :
                   This award is to purchase an autonomous robot with on-                    
              board drive system, processors for navigation and control,                     
              sensors and embedded controllers, ultrasonic sonar sensing,                    
              pyroelectric motion sensors, touch sensors, low-cost vision                    
              and optical sensors, and stereo cameras.  The equipment will                   
              provide the supporting technology for several research                         
              projects in the areas of robotic sensing, planning, and                        
              control in unstructured environments.                                          
                                                                                             
              Much of the research in robotics and machine vision has been                   
              confined to problems of a static nature.  Acquisition of an                    
              autonomous mobile robot with a vision system will provide                      
              Cornell University with the supporting technology for                          
              research projects in recognition and recognizability, motion                   
              and shape from image sequences, and sensor interpretation and                  
              task-directed planning.
