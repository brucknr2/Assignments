Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Collective induction is the cooperative search for descriptive,                
              predictive, and explanatory generalizations, rules, and                        
              principles.  Research with cooperative 4-person groups using                   
              face-to-face communication indicates that the groups are                       
              remarkably able to recognize correct hypotheses if proposed by a               
              group member, but rarely form correct emergent group hypotheses                
              unless proposed by a group member.  Increasing information                     
              increases the number of correct hypotheses, but also increases                 
              the number of incorrect group hypotheses.  The research will                   
              compare face-to-face versus computer-mediated communication under              
              three conditions that are predicted to raise computer-mediated                 
              collective induction to or beyond the levels reached in face-to-               
              face communication.  The research should help to realize the                   
              potential of computer-mediated communication by allowing                       
              effective collective induction by any group of dispersed members.
