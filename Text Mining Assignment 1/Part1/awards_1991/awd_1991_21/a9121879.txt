Abstract    :
                   Commercial fishing vessels use very large drift nets in                   
              which a variety of animals, including seabirds, become entangled               
              and die.  Drift nets may be a significant source of mortality for              
              some species, and Dr. Sievert Rohwer of the University of                      
              Washington has devised a method of estimating the degree to which              
              drift nets are diminishing sea bird population.  Observers from                
              the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service will be accompanying                        
              commercial fishing ships from Japan, Taiwan, and Korea this                    
              coming year, and Dr. Rohwer has arranged for the seabirds                      
              harvested in their drift nets to be donated to the Burke Museum                
              of the University of Washington for further study.                             
                   This program of specimen acquisition and curation will bring              
              new Pacific seabird species to light, and will allow ecologists                
              to determine the species that are most affected by drift nets.                 
              Ecologists will be able to ascertain the age distribution of                   
              birds killed in this manner.  This information will help in the                
              formulation of fishing policies, and the design of management                  
              plans for threatened or endangered species.
