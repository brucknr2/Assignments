Abstract    :
                   The PI will carry out a multifaceted suite of experiments to              
              investigate the physical links among local energy minimum (LEM)                
              domain states. LEM-LEM transitions, and thermoremanent                         
              magnetization (TRM) in magnetite, titanomagnetite, and pyrrhotite.             
              This work would utilize magnetic domain observations coupled with              
              measurements of TRMs in single particles.
