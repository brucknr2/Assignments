Abstract    :
                   This project will produce current information on the                      
              demographic and employment characteristics of doctoral scientists,             
              engineers, and humanists in the U. S.  To accomplish this, the                 
              contractor will conduct the 1991 Survey of Doctorate Recipients,               
              develop a longitudinal file of information (the Doctorate Work                 
              History File), and prepare a variety of cross-tabulations from the             
              1991 survey. The survey response rate will be greatly enhanced by              
              extensive use of Computer assisted telephone interviews (CATI).                
                   The Foundation is responsible for developing and maintaining              
              a data base of demographic, educational, and employment information            
              on scientists and engineers.  This data base, the Scientific and               
              Technical Personnel Data System, requires input from three survey              
              series: The National Survey of Natural and Social Scientists and               
              Engineers, the Survey of Natural and Social Scientist and                      
              Engineering Graduates, and the Survey of Doctorate Recipients.                 
              Data from the Survey of Doctorate Recipients are frequently used to            
              determine the status of various aspects of U.S. science and                    
              engineering , e.g., changes in research and development activities,            
              and are also used in conjunction with data from the other surveys              
              for analytical and policy purposes.  Cosponsoring agencies are                 
              National Endowment for the Humanities, National Institutes of                  
              Health, Department of Energy, and Nuclear Regulatory Agency.
