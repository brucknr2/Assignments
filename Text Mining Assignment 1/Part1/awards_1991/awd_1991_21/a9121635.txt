Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Solute atom segregation and phase transitions at internal                      
              interfaces in metal alloys are studied using sophisticated high                
              resolution techniques.  The objective is to understand the                     
              segregation of solute atoms as a function of the structure of an               
              interface and the thermodynamics of the bulk system.  The chemical             
              compositions of individual boundaries are measured by atom probe               
              field ion microscopy and atomic resolution analytical electron                 
              microscopy.  Simulation techniques are employed to explore the                 
              eight-dimensional hyperspace of a grain boundary with respect to               
              solute atom segregation and phase transitions.  Both tilt and twist            
              grain boundaries are studied with different crystallographic                   
              interfaces.                                                                    
              %%%                                                                            
              Interface properties play a major role in determining important                
              properties of metal alloys that can determine their end use, such              
              as a structural material or magnetic material.  This research                  
              should result in a better understanding of solute segregation at               
              interfaces, which in turn affects the interfacial properties.
