Abstract    :
                   This action would provide support for the involvement of                  
              a small group from the University of California, Principal                     
              Investigator, Harry H. Bingham, in an experiment at Fermilab                   
              to study aspects of production of very rare particles with the                 
              "beauty flavour."  The experiment uses state of the art                        
              silicon devices and sophisticated electronic techniques to                     
              pick out the very rare collisions of high energy protons from                  
              the accelerator on a nuclear target which result in production                 
              of these particles.                                                            
                   The group is also involved in the analyses of data from                   
              completed experiments involving high energy gamma ray                          
              interactions with protons in bubble chambers and with other                    
              high energy photons in an electronic spectrometer facility                     
              which was housed in a e+e- collider at SLAC.  Data from a                      
              further experiment with a bubble chamber which had been                        
              exposed to a beam of neutrinos is also to be analysed using                    
              the funds requested.
