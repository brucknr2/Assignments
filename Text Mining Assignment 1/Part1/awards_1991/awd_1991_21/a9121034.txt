Abstract    :
              This award will support field collaboration between Frederick                  
              Frey of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and D.                       
              Delpino of the Servicio Geologico Nacional in Argentina.  The                  
              project aims to sample recent lavas erupted east of the                        
              active Andean volcanic front from 35 degrees to 37 degrees S                   
              in Argentina, in order to understand volcanism in the southern                 
              Andes and the pertinent volcanic rocks erupted in Chile and                    
              Argentina.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              The fieldwork and sampling are located in regions that have                    
              been mapped by Delpino and colleagues, but the recent                          
              volcanic features have not been sampled for detailed                           
              geochemical studies.  There are two principal reasons for                      
              studying these lavas erupted 500-200 km east of the active                     
              Andean volcanic front:  (1) it is likely that the MgO-rich                     
              alkaline basalts erupted in Argentina east of the front more                   
              directly reflect their mantle source composition than the                      
              relatively evolved lavas which form the stratovolcanoes on                     
              the front; (2) by studying lavas erupted at varying distances                  
              across the strike of the front, researchers can define                         
              geochemical trends as a function of distance from the Chile                    
              trench.  With this information, they expect to develop new                     
              constraints on the sources and processes involved in creating                  
              this portion of the Andean volcanic arc.  The U.S. side has                    
              geochemical analytical and interpretive expertise in                           
              understanding the origin and evolution of volcanic rocks.                      
              The Argentines have expertise in field volcanology and in                      
              local geology and logistics.
