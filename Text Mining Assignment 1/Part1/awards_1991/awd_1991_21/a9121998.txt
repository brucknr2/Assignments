Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              An idealized study of barotropic eddies in the ocean will be                   
              conducted by means of numerical simulations and semi-analytic                  
              calculations. This is an important step to understanding the                   
              dynamics of isolated baroclinic vortices in a realistic ocean.                 
              Numerical simulations and laboratory experiments have shown that,              
              although the intermediate behavior of the eddies can be very                   
              complicated, the final result of instability is either a stable                
              rotating tripole or a pair of stable translating dipoles. An                   
              analytic study of the stability of the initial vorticity profiles              
              to finite amplitude perturbations will also be done using a moment             
              approach based on Lagrangian perturbations.
