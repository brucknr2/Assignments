Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will work a variety of problems                
              dealing with the control of nonlinear systems.  In particular,                 
              the large time behavior of the filtering diffusion, the                        
              uniqueness of viscosity solutions of Bellman's equation, and                   
              adaptive control treated as a Bayesian problem will be                         
              considered.                                                                    
                   Control theory deals with the theoretical aspects of                      
              understanding how complex systems learn about its environment,                 
              process the information to reduce uncertainty, plan, generate and              
              execute control actions.  It has played a major role in many                   
              areas of science and engineering.
