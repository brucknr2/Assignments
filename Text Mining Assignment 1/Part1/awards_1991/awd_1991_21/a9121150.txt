Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                                         ABSTRACT                                            
                                                                                             
                                                                                            
              This research will increase our understanding of longitudinal                  
              change in adaptive and maladaptive development of adolescents and              
              the relation of this change to family behavior patterns.  The                  
              relation between adolescent functioning and family behaviors will              
              be examined with a two-phase sampling design.  The first phase is              
              an epidemiological survey of the relation between family                       
              processes and adolescent functioning in a community population of              
              adolescents from nine working-class, rural towns in New England.               
              The second phase selects for intensive study a subsample of 100                
              families of adolescents chosen for their representativeness of                 
              the larger community population.  The adolescents in the larger                
              community sample and the families from the subsample will be                   
              studied at two times points two years apart in order to examine                
              longitudinal change.  The epidemiological survey phase tests                   
              hypotheses about the relation of family factors to adolescent                  
              outcome in a large, well-defined population.  The intensive study              
              of the representative subsample delineates specific family                     
              behavior patterns that are associated with varying longitudinal                
              trajectories of adolescent adaptation.  This intensive second                  
              phase uses methods of direct observation of family behavior                    
              patterns as well as standardized questionnaires and tests to                   
              assess all family members' functioning.  This research will                    
              increase our understanding of the relationship between adolescent              
              functioning and family behaviors.
