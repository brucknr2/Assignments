Abstract    :
                   The objective of this research is to investigate the concept              
              of an intelligent pallet.  The idea is to provide intelligence to              
              the media on which parts are physically carried through the various            
              manufacturing resources.  The pallets will be assumed to be                    
              enslaved in the system, each equipped with its own central                     
              processing unit (CPU) and memory devices.  In this scenario, the               
              manufacturing resources are merely agents which will service the               
              commands from an Intelligent Pallet to process, move, and/or                   
              assemble the part(s) it carries.                                               
                   This project includes the analysis of technological barriers              
              and economic feasibility.  Evaluation of the structure of the                  
              control system and its implementation including issues such as the             
              feasibility of a heterarchical control architecture, problems                  
              associated with wireless communication, and information flow will              
              also be addresses at both theoretical and experimental levels.                 
              Applicability and generalizability of the results of this effort               
              is enhanced through industrial collaboration and matching support              
              from the Purdue Engineering Research Center.
