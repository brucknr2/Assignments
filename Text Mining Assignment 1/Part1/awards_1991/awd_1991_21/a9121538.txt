Abstract    :
              The notion that social, cultural, and economic differences                     
              between immigrants and natives fade over the course of a few                   
              generations is the essence of the assimilation hypothesis.                     
              Recent sociological and historical research rejects the                        
              hypothesis that full assimilation is an unavoidable outcome of                 
              the ethnic experience.  This literature stresses the fact that                 
              the United states remains a multicultural, pluralistic society                 
              and cites as evidence the social, cultural, and economic                       
              differences that exist and persist among ethnic groups.  The                   
              purpose of this project is to develop a theoretical and empirical              
              analysis of why and how these ethnic differences in skills and                 
              earnings persist across generations.                                           
                                                                                             
              The operational hypothesis of the study is that ethnicity acts as              
              an externality in the human capital accumulation process.  The                 
              simplest version of this hypothesis states that the skills of the              
              next generation depend not only parental inputs, but also on the               
              average quality of the ethnic environment in which these                       
              investments are made.  The introduction of ethnic capital into an              
              economic model of intergenerational mobility has an important,                 
              fundamental implication: ethnic differences and skills and                     
              earning observed in this generation are likely to persist for                  
              many generations and these difference may not be amenable to easy              
              eradication.  This hypothesis will be tested using a number of                 
              data sets, including the General Social Surveys, the National                  
              Longitudinal Surveys of Youth, and Public Use Samples of the U.S.              
              Census.
