Abstract    :
              This project involves a detailed study of several metals which are             
              well known to have an electronic structure characterized by a Fermi            
              surface.  The technique employed is high-resolution photo-emission             
              spectroscopy with synchrotron radiation sources.  The immediate                
              objective is to determine the (presently unknown) photoemission                
              lineshape in these materials.  This information will potentially be            
              valuable in the interpretation of photoemission data for high                  
              temperature superconductor materials.  This may help clarify the               
              Fermi-surface characteristics of these materials.
