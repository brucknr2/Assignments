Abstract    :
              This dissertation improvement grant project will test hypotheses               
              regarding the effects of the Little Ice Age cold period on                     
              Icelandic settlements using archaeological data, animal and fish               
              bones, as well as marine molluscs. A baseline study will be made               
              of stable carbon and oxygen isotopes and cadmium/calcium ratios in             
              shells reflective of changes in local water temperatures and                   
              salinity in the North Atlantic. These studies are expected to                  
              provide climatic data of direct relevance to questions of economic             
              change on Iceland and contribute to current research on                        
              global climate change.
