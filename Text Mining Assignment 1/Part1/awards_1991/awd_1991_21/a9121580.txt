Abstract    :
              The term currently most succcessful in drawing attention to                    
              global environmental problems and fostering action to combat                   
              those problems is 'biodiversity.'  The central aim of this                     
              dissertation research project is to examine how and why                        
              scientists have shaped the concept of 'biodiversity' and promoted              
                                                                                             
              it to a broad audience.  Through an extensive literature review                
              and numerous interviews, the investigator plans to analyze why                 
              scientists value biodiversity, how they have promulgated this                  
              value in the public realm, and how they intend their results to                
              influence environmental conservation imperatives, societal values              
                                                                                             
              towards nature, and nature itself.  Analysis of scientific                     
              advocacy in the name of 'biodiversity' provides insight into the               
                                                                                             
              complex interactions between scientists' values, society's                     
              values, conservation, and the natural world.  This modest grant                
              will enable the collection of interview data in various parts of               
                                                                                             
              the U.S. and Costa Rica.
