Abstract    :
                   This award is to purchase two 80386 and two i860 nodes,                   
              two disk drives, I/O controller and 16MB memory to upgrade an                  
              Intel iPSC/2 hypercube.  The equipment will support the                        
              development of a test-bed environment to support research                      
              projects including the verification of highly-complex                          
              protocols, the exploitation of parallelism with an integrated                  
              relational textual and image database, the development of a                    
              hardware design functional simulator, and the                                  
              characterization of background clutter in natural scenes.                      
                                                                                             
              George Mason University plans to upgrade an existing Intel                     
              iPSC/2 hypercube facility to enable research in                                
              heterogeneous, tightly-coupled multicomputing.  The proposed                   
              equipment will be used to develop algorithms for applications                  
              requiring large data transfer.
