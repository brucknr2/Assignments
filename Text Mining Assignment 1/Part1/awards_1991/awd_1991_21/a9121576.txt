Abstract    :
              In this project, jointly funded by the Physical Chemistry and                  
              Biophysics Programs, X-ray absorption techniques for high                      
              resolution studies of metal ion centers in biologically                        
              important molecules will be developed.  Specific attention will                
              be paid to developing direct probes of covalence in iron- and                  
              copper-containing proteins.                                                    
              %%%                                                                            
              Nitrogenase, the enzyme responsible for converting atmospheric                 
              nitrogen to ammonia, is one of nature's major sources of                       
              fertilizer. Detailed chemical understanding of the biological                  
              process by which this conversion is accomplished brings us                     
              closer to the goal of economical and environmentally benign                    
              fertilizer production. This project, by developing X-ray                       
              methods of determining structure and bonding in the relevant                   
              enzymes, may lead to major breakthroughs in this effort.
