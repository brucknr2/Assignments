Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A compensatory movement called optokinetic nystagmus functions to              
              stabilize vision when the surrounding visual world is moved. This              
              reflexive eye movement is controled by structures of the brain                 
              located both in " higher centers" such as the cerebral cortex and              
              in "lower centers" such as the nucleus of the optic tract, the                 
              dorsal terminal acessory nucleus and the lateral terminal acessory             
              optic nucleus. In this award to Dr. Roland Giolli, studies will be             
              conducted to determine how these different areas are interconnected            
              by tracing the neuroanatomical pathways between them. In addition,             
              the precise localization of the neurotransmitter GABA, which is                
              involved in inhibitory responses of these pathways, will be                    
              identified by immunocytochemical methods. This research will                   
              contribute basic knowledge about the role of the brain in control              
              of eye movements.
