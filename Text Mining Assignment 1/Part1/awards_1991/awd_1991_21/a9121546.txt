Abstract    :
              Much of modern biology is becoming dependent on complex models,                
              analyses and theoretical tests that depend directly on the                     
              applications of modern mathematics and computer science.  For                  
              example, the construction of very large DNA sequences and genetic              
              marker maps require considerable computer analysis as well as                  
              efforts of organizing and maintaining such information in timely               
              accessible databases.  In addition, the identification of                      
              functions encoded within the genetic sequences have also been                  
              obtained using computer-aided comparative sequence and complex                 
              pattern search methods.  The work conducted under this award will              
              provide support for research into the development of these                     
              technologies and validation of their application to fundamental                
              questions in the biology with several major goals:                             
              1)  The further automation of the ARIEL pattern induction and                  
              domain expert assistant system.  The use of "massively parallel"               
              computer hardware will be continued.                                           
              2)  The extension of the pattern system to utilize more global                 
              structural and functional information, e.g. the overall protein                
              structural domain classification or the cellular organelle                     
              localization.                                                                  
              3)  Development of proper statistical methods for evaluating the               
              likelihood of an induced pattern being obtained by chance.  This               
              will involve the study of a number of pattern representation                   
              "languages" and the selection of proper negative control sets.
