Abstract    :
              The Fourteenth International Conference on Software Engineering                
              (ICSE 14) is scheduled to be held in Melbourne, Australia, May 11-15,          
              1992.  Tony Montgomery, from the Royal Melbourne Institute of                  
              Technology, is general chair and Lori A. Clarke, from the University           
              of Massachusetts, and Carlo Ghezzi, from the Politecnico de Milano,            
              are Program co-chairs.                                                         
                                                                                             
              The requested travel funds are to help defray the high cost of travel          
              to Australia.  Many researchers do not have funds to fully support             
              such a trip.  Travel funds from this grant would be distributed by the         
              two ICSE 14 program chairs and a small subcommittee selected from the          
              program committee members.                                                     
                                                                                             
              All authors of papers and abstracts and panel speakers will be                 
              notified about the availability of travel funds and asked to submit an         
              application if such funds are desired.  Applications instructions              
              will ask for information about current travel funds and for a current          
              curricula vita or resume.  Priority will be given to authors of papers         
              and to young developing researchers.
