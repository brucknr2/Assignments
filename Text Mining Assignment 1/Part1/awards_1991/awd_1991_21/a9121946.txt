Abstract    :
              Preliminary measurements of the conductivity in high Tc 1-2-3 type             
              copper oxide crystals after a short pulse of intense visible                   
              radiation show the lifetime of the photo-excited state is enhanced             
              by nearly three orders of magnitude.  The goal is to test two                  
              hypotheses:  (1) the excitation process causes phase separation of             
              the photo-induced carriers into metallic regions or droplets and               
              (2) a photo-induced high temperature superconducting state is                  
              present in these phase separated metallic regions.  Steady state               
              and fast transient spectroscopy will be undertaken on several high             
              Tc materials using strip-line configurations as a function of                  
              temperature and magnetic field.
