Abstract    :
              The proposal MAX '91 plans to study solar activity during the                  
              period of solar maximum 91-94 with emphasis on coordination of                 
              observations from existing facilities, as well as from new                     
              balloon, rocket and ground-based instrumentation.  Alan                        
              Kiplinger has acted in the capacity of Max '91 Coordinator and                 
              has conducted three major worldwide campaigns in the last few                  
              years.  He supported several rocket flights, and set up a near-                
              real-time solar computer data base at NOAA's Space Environment                 
              Laboratory.  The investigator proposes to continue to carry out                
              coordination of the Max '91 program during the remainder of solar              
              maximum by operationally supporting several new major campaigns,               
              rocket and balloon flights and "target of opportunity" campaigns.              
              This support includes distributions of Campaign Announcements                  
              with planning information,as well as Campaign Summaries which                  
              provide plots and lists of solar activity and compilations                     
              observations conducted worldwide.  The Coordinator also proposes               
              to continue to develop new products and data bases which can be                
              used by and distributed to the scientific community.  An example               
              is development of a digital archival system to capture  5,500                  
              digital images per day from the five fulltime U.S.A.F. SOON                    
              observatories located around the world.  These data should become              
              a significant cornerstone of observations for studies of flares                
              triggering, flare build-up and energetics, as well as active                   
              region evolution.                                                              
              A vigorous pursuit of independent research by the Coordinator has              
              proven to be beneficial to Max '91 as well as to his long-term                 
              research goals.  Accordingly, a variety of studies with the High               
              Speed Ho Camera system also are proposed.  These studies include               
              new observations of impulsive flares in pursuit of electron time               
              of flight effects.  Other proposed studies include optical                     
              observations of formations of active filaments, microwave spike                
              bursts and an upgrade of the system to obtain measurements of                  
              linear polarization in flares with a temporal resolution of 0.4s.
