Abstract    :
                   This award is for the purchase of a multiple degree of                    
              freedom, high precision, light weight stereo camera head.                      
              The same equipment is being purchased at three other                           
              institutions in a shared research effort.  Research topics                     
              include gaze control and target tracking, stereo and motion                    
              analysis, landmark-based navigation, automatic acquisition of                  
              object and environmental models, hand-eye coordination,                        
              dextrous manipulation with multi-fingered hands, real-time                     
              perception and manipulation.  System software, algorithms and                  
              subsystems will be shared across the institutions.                             
                                                                                             
              The University of Maryland will be purchasing equipment to                     
              support a multi-institutional shared research effort in                        
              active vision for robot navigation and manipulation.  Other                    
              members of the consortium are the University of Rochester,                     
              University of Pennsylvania and the University of                               
              Massachusetts.  Each institution will acquire the same state-                  
              of-the-art binocular camera head of high precision and high                    
              speed, and will share in the development of systems software                   
              and application software.
