Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research in             
              parallel computing and software libraries between Jack Dongarra of             
              the University of Tennessee and Bernard Tourancheau of the                     
              Laboratory for Parallel Computing at the Ecole Normale                         
              Superieure, Lyon, France.  The investigators seek to develop high              
              performance communication and computation routines for linear                  
              algebra algorithms on distributed-memory supercomputers.  Dr.                  
              Dongarra's group brings to this collaboration experience in                    
              developing software libraries for linear algebra subroutines.  This            
              is complemented by the French investigator's expertise in linear               
              algebra algorithms and access to unique parallel computers in                  
              Lyon.                                                                          
                                                                                             
              Recent advances in the development of software libraries have led              
              to better, more efficient software performance and a greater                   
              portability amongst machines.  Research has progressed from                    
              vector computers to shared-memory computers and currently is                   
              focused on distributed memory systems for high performance                     
              supercomputers.  This collaborative effort is oriented towards the             
              development of software libraries for distributed memory systems.              
              The ultimate goal is the development of a standardized code and                
              portable software libraries for the supercomputers of the future.
