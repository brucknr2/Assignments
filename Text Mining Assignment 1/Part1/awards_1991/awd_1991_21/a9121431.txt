Abstract    :
              This proposal is for a focused research program for the                        
              investigation of efficient parallel iterative methods for the                  
              solution of large systems arising from models with general                     
              geometries and other irregularities, where the lack of regular                 
              structure makes it hard to use existing techniques.  The methods               
              will be implemented on advanced parallel architectures, such as                
              CRAY-YMP, Connection Machine and Intel Hypercube.
