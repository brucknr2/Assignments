Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This grant is to establish a Materials Research Group at Brown                 
              University to do research on the topic of ultrafast spectroscopy of            
              nanostructure materials.  This is a coherent, basic program of                 
              research with a particular investigative emphasis on the study of              
              specific nanostructured semiconductor-based electronic materials.              
              The focus is defined by the study of electronic heterostructures in            
              terms of real-time dynamics of electronic and vibrational                      
              excitations as well as their coupling by ultrafast laser                       
              spectroscopy.  The propagation and interaction of these                        
              excitations, and how they are affected by spatial constraints                  
              provide the main theme of the proposal.  Topics being investigated             
              include electron-phonon interaction, propagation of phonons,                   
              ultrafast space resolved spectroscopy of electronic phenomena in               
              compound semiconductors, ultrafast electron dynamics in metallic               
              thin films, and ultrafast dynamics of electron-phonon interaction              
              in semiconductor nanostructures.                                               
                                                                                             
              The Materials Research Group undertakes materials research of a                
              scope or complexity that would not be feasible through traditional             
              individual investigator research.  Progress is enhanced through a              
              group of investigators with diverse backgrounds participating in               
              interactive, collaborative research.
