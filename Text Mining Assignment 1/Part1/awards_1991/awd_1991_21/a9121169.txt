Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              It has been recognized for over twenty years that the abundance                
              of the light isotope 3He provides a sensitive theoretical                      
              constraint on Big Bang models of the first few minutes of the                  
              Universe.  Drs. Bania and Rood propose to continue work previously             
              supported by the NSF to determine the abundance ratio 3He/H in                 
              glowing interstellar gas clouds ("H II" and planetary nebulae)                 
              surrounding hot stars in our  Galaxy and nearby galaxies. The                  
              Investigators have substantially improved radio receivers and                  
              reduction procedures in order both to detect fainter sources and               
              to select those in which nuclear evolutionary processes in nearby              
              stars have been minimal.  It is expected that new constraints can              
              be placed on early Universe Big Bang models as a result of this                
              three year program.
