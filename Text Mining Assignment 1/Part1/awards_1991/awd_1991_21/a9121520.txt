Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is the development of                            
              practical, multivariate, nonlinear, model predictive                           
              control (NMPC) for fossil power plants.  The                                   
              approach involves the development of a generic,                                
              first-principles, reduced-order model which captures                           
              the dominant static and dynamic characteristics of a                           
              power plant.  This model is necessary in order to                              
              predict the plant behavior.  Since the model will not                          
              exactly match the true plant structure, the                                    
              parameters of the model must be estimated using                                
              prediction error methods or nonlinear least squares.                           
              This model will then be used to estimate process                               
              states in real time for an optimal control sequence.
