Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is the fourth international conference on quasicrystals and               
              the first to be held in the United States.  Topics to be discussed             
              include understanding the geometry and chemical decorations of the             
              quasicrystal structures, detailed structural studies on large,                 
              single quasicrystals, and the formation, stability, and physical               
              properties of quasicrystals.  New frontiers in quasicrystal                    
              research are covered, including diffraction and dynamics of                    
              synthetic non-periodic structures.                                             
              %%%                                                                            
              While similar to crystals in many respects, quasicrystals have                 
              important differences that may lead to novel behavior.  Some models            
              suggest exotic electronic properties.  Unusual magnetic behavior               
              may result from the extremely high symmetry about certain atomic               
              sites.
