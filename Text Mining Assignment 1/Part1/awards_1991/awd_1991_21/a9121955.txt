Abstract    :
              This Science in Developing Countries award will                                
              support the research collaboration of T. Kent Kirk of                          
              the University of Wisconsin and Rafael Vicuna of the                           
              Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile.  The project                         
              aims to introduce fungal research into the Chilean                             
              investigator's laboratory, and to characterize the                             
              lignin-degrading enzyme system of unusual lignin-                              
              degrading fungi from Chile and the U.S.                                        
                                                                                             
              Through this project, the Chilean scientist will learn                         
              techniques for physiological, biochemical, and genetic                         
              studies with filamentous fungi.  His will become the                           
              first laboratory in Chile with expertise in the                                
              molecular genetics of higher filamentous fungi, and                            
              one of the few working with these fungi in any                                 
              capacity.  One U.S. and two Chilean strains of lignin-                         
              degrading fungi will be studied.  Enzymes they produce                         
              will be identified and characterized.  Conditions for                          
              optimal enzyme production and efficient lignin                                 
              mineralization will be determined.  The investigators'                         
              past collaboration has shown that bacteria exert only                          
              minor action on polymeric lignin.  Thus, the Chilean                           
              researcher now aims to focus on fungi.  The                                    
              ligninolytic fungi have substantial potential for                              
              practical applications in Chile and U.S., particularly                         
              for the paper pulping industry.  Both the U.S. and                             
              Chilean sides will benefit from the basic information                          
              generated by their research.
