Abstract    :
              Work on this project will be in the following topical areas:                   
              1. Full nuclear Overhauser effect characterization of                          
              template-nucleated alanine helices through study of                            
              deuterium-labeled derivatives.  2. Determination for the first                 
              time of the experimental length-dependence of the CD                           
              ellipticities for short alanine-derived helices.  3.                           
              Measurements of the energetics and stabilization/                              
              destabilization of helices by the twenty amino acid residues,                  
              using template-nucleated helices.  These measurements should                   
              resolve the current controversies concerning the magnitudes and                
              independence of s values (helix propagation constants).  4.                    
              Design, synthesis, and study of maximally nucleating helix                     
              templates.  5. Measurement in templated systems of the                         
              magnitudes of polar stabilization effects.                                     
                                                                                             
              With this award, the Organic Synthesis Program will support the                
              research of Dr. Daniel S. Kemp at Massachusetts Institute of                   
              Technology.  The research will develop structural models that                  
              will facilitate the evaluation of parameters which control the                 
              formation of secondary and tertiary structure in peptide                       
              chains.  This information is crucial to the understanding of                   
              protein chemistry and the design of biologically active                        
              molecules for biochemistry and medicine, as well as in the                     
              chemical industry.
