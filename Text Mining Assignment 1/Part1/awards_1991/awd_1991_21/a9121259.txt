Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              An analytical transmission electron microscope will be used to                 
              strengthen research programs in metallurgy and materials science and           
              engineering in the Armour College of Engineering and Science at the            
              Illinois Institute of Technology.  This electron microscope will enhance       
              the current research programs of an expanding faculty in the                   
              Metallurgical and Materials Engineering Department on: intermetallic           
              compounds, nickel-base superalloys, high-strength low alloy steels,            
              railroad steels, eutectic systems, ceramics and ceramic matrix                 
              composites.  It will also be used by solid state physicists, biologists,       
              chemists and chemical and mechanical engineers.  The microscope will           
              have a strong impact on the ability of IIT's materials community to            
              develop new research programs and the quality of both graduate and             
              undergraduate education.
