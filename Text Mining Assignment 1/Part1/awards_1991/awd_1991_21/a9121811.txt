Abstract    :
              The mechanism and kinetics of the deposition of cadmium                        
              telluride from the decomposition of dimethylcadmium and                        
              diethyltellurium are determined.  Preliminary results indicate                 
              that deposition occurs by a catalytic reaction consisting of                   
              the adsorption of the organometallic molecules on the alkyl                    
              groups.  In this study, the elementary kinetics of adsorption                  
              and decomposition of dimethylcadmium and diethyl tellurium on                  
              (2x8) gallium arsenide (100) are determined in ultrahigh                       
              vacuum.  Internal-reflection infrared spectroscopy and X-ray                   
              photoelectron spectroscopy identify the adsorbed species and                   
              measure their surface coverages.  Temperature-programmed                       
              desorption is used to characterize the decomposition kinetics.                 
              A kinetic parameters become available, they are incorporated                   
              into mathematical models suitable for the design,                              
              optimization, and control of organometallic vapor-phase                        
              epitaxy (OMVPE) reactors.                                                      
                                                                                             
              This project provides the fundamental data needed for process                  
              and reactor models of OMVPE, and makes a start on developing                   
              these models.  OMPVE is a very promising technology for                        
              producing layered structures of compound semiconductors, which                 
              form the active region of such electronic and photonic devices                 
              as high-speed field-effect transistors, light-emitting diodes,                 
              solid-state lasers, infrared detectors, and solar cells.
