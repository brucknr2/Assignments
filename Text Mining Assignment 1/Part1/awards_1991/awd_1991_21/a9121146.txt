Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The neuron, the single brain cell which is the basic unit of the               
              brain, was discovered 100 years ago.  It is now estimated that                 
              there are a trillion cells in the brain which are interconnected by            
              a vast and complex system.  Communication between any two neurons              
              involves the release of chemical neurotransmitters at the synapse,             
              or area of contact.  Dr. Lloyd's research is directed towards                  
              understanding the mechanisms underlying the modulation of synaptic             
              transmission.  While it was once readily accepted that an                      
              individual neuron only contained one specific neurotransmitter, it             
              is now clear that a neuron may have multiple transmitters as well              
              as other chemicals, such as peptides, that have modulatory action.             
              Dr. Lloyd has identified motor neurons in which conventional                   
              neurotransmitters are co-localized with neuropeptides.  He will now            
              use a combination of state-of-the-art biochemical and                          
              neurophysiological techniques to examine how peptides are released             
              from these neurons and their interaction with conventional                     
              neurotransmitters at pre-and post synaptic sites.  The results from            
              these studies will lead to new insights into the crucial role that             
              neurotransmitters play in the functioning of the brain.  Moreover,             
              given that alternation in neurotransmitters are implicated in a                
              number of neurological disorders, these studies may be of potential            
              importance for the development of treatments to alleviate these                
              diseases.
