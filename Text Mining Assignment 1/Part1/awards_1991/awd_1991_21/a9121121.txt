Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The function of the brain, memory and learning and behavior is                 
              critically dependent on nerve cells to transmit, process and store             
              information.  To fulfill these tasks neurons possess unique                    
              structures - extensions of their cell body (dendrites and axons)-              
              that terminate (synapse) on other cells to allow electrical and                
              chemical communication between them.  These synaptic junctions are             
              the localized sites where neurotransmitters are stored, released,              
              synthesized and recycled.  The characterization of the molecular               
              and chemical components of the synapse such as the protein SNAP-25,            
              is an important goal of research in the understanding of the                   
              nervous system.  SNAP-25 is a prominent protein found in nerve                 
              terminals of the mature nervous system only and seems to be                    
              preserved up through the animal kingdom suggesting that it has                 
              important nervous system function.
