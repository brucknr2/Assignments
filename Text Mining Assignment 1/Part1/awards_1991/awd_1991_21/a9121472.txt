Abstract    :
              This research is in the area of computational complexity theory.  It           
              will continue to develop the complexity theory of real functions.  The         
              main idea is to apply the concepts and techniques of discrete NP-              
              completeness theory to prove lower bound results for important                 
              classical theorems in real and complex analysis, as well as important          
              computational problems in numerical analysis.  The research will study         
              the notions of generalized Kolmogorov complexity and instance                  
              complexity in the context of structural complexity theory, and the             
              relationship between these notions and other important ideas in                
              complexity theory:  one-way functions, average-case completeness and           
              pseudorandomness.//
