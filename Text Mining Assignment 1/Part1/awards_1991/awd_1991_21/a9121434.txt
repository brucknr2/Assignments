Abstract    :
                   This award is to provide partial support for conducting the               
              second colloquium on Materials Handling Research.  This colloquium             
              is focused on the current state of materials handling research and             
              to identify the critical issues to be addressed in the last decade             
              of the 20th century.  These issues were partially addressed in the             
              first colloquium and a continuation of the effort will enable the              
              broadening of the base of participants and build better                        
              communication links within the research community and between the              
              research and the industrial community.
