Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Understanding of the mechanisms by which central pattern generating            
              networks are formed during development requires the study of model             
              systems in which both the motor responses and the behavioral                   
              patterns can be studied simultaneously. One important invertebrate             
              model system, which has been studied extensively, is the                       
              stomatogastric ganglion of the adult lobster; this structure                   
              controls stomach movements. In this award, Dr. Joseph Ayers will               
              study the development feeding behavior and how it is coordinated               
              with the development of the motor patterns of the muscles                      
              controlled by the stomatogastric ganglion nerve cells. The basic               
              hypothesis is that early larval motor patterns are simple and that             
              the more complex patterns and adaptive reflexes characteristc of               
              adult specimens are elaborated in these larval stages as the motor             
              apparatus takes form. The video motion analysis system and                     
              correlated electromyographic recordings will be used to determine              
              the overall temporal organization of feeding behavior in the larvae            
              and how it changes from stage to stage, as well as how the motor               
              patterns are affected by the type of food. This research will                  
              contribute fundamental knowledge about the development and                     
              generation of motor patterns that control important functions such             
              as feeding behavior.
