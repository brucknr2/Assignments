Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Dr. Kulsrud, at Princeton University, will investigate the origin              
              and evolution of the magnetic field in our Galaxy.  The study has              
              four parts: (1) To consider the dynamo origin theory and the                   
              primordial theories on the assumption that the Interstellar Medium             
              (ISM) is homogeneous; (2) To consider the same two theories on the             
              basis of an inhomogeneous model of the ISM taking into account the             
              cloud/intercloud medium; (3) To consider the possibility that the              
              primordial field could arise from flux in jets from more active                
              galaxies or quasars that preceded the formation of our Galaxy; and             
              (4) To make use of critical observations such as cosmic ray                    
              lifetimes, the initial mass function at different times and places,            
              and the rotation measurements of quasars, to limit the possible                
              theories for magnetic field origin and evolution.
