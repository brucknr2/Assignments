Abstract    :
              This grant will partially support a                                            
              minisymposium entitled "Biotechnology for                                      
              Biomedical Engineers:  A Look to the Future",                                  
              to be held in conjunction with the 13th                                        
              Annual Conference of the IEEE/EMBS                                             
              (Engineering in Medicine and Biology                                           
              Society).  The Conference will be in Orlando,                                  
              Florida on October 31 to November 3, 1991.                                     
              The purpose of the minisymposium is to                                         
              identify important research areas in                                           
              biotechnology where biomedical engineers can                                   
              contribute with their expertise.  Prominent                                    
              scientists/engineers will be invited to give                                   
              tutorial lectures about the frontiers of                                       
              biotechnology.  It is expected that the                                        
              minisymposium will continue the creation of                                    
              an environment where biotechnologists and                                      
              biomedical engineers can work together toward                                  
              common research goals.
