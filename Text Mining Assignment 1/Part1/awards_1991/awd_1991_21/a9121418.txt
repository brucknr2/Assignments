                                         ABSTRACT                                            
                                                                                             
                  The "Northern Caddoan Dictionaries Project" will compile                  
              reference dictionaries of two closely related American Indian                  
              languages of the Caddoan family, Arikara and Pawnee, which are                 
              spoken today by only a dozen elderly tribal members in North                   
              Dakota and Oklahoma.  The dictionaries, each to contain                        
              approximately 8,000 entries, will draw upon all available lexical              
              and textual materials:  data collected by the PI over the past                 
              twenty-five years; data collected by anthropologists earlier in                
              the century; and data in historical sources.  Three months of                  
              additional field work will fill in lacunae in the data base.                   
              Although there is no dialectal diversity within Arikara today,                 
              there are two dialects of Pawnee still spoken--South Band and                  
              Skiri-- and the Pawnee dictionary will account for the                         
              differences between these two forms of speech.                                 
                   The project, part of a larger effort to document Pawnee and               
              Arikara as fully as possible, will result in the first reference               
              dictionaries ever compiled for them.  The dictionaries, moreover,              
              will provide essential data for the comparative study of the                   
              Caddoan language family and the interrelationships of the Caddoan              
              languages with other genetically related languages families in                 
              the New World.  They will also serve as reference tools for                    
              scholars and in language classes in the Arikara and Pawnee                     
              communities.
