Abstract    :
              Dissertation student:  Peter J. Ramberg;  Dissertation topic:                  
              "The Early History of Stereochemistry, 1874-1920."                             
              Mr. Ramberg is studying several cases in the early history of                  
              stereochemistry that show how chemists became convinced that they              
              were dealing with a new cause of chemical phenomena.  He is                    
              investigating how and why chemists came to the conclusion that                 
              spatial characteristics were a "real" cause of chemical                        
              phenomena.  Using the unpublished manuscripts of Johannes                      
              Wislicenus and Victor Meyer, as well as the published chemical                 
              record, Mr. Ramberg is examining the birth of stereochemistry and              
              is exploring the reasons for its appeal to chemists as well as                 
              the reasons some objected to its importance.  Following an                     
              examination of the birth of stereochemistry, Mr. Ramberg is also               
              examining three early case studies where stereo chemical                       
              principles were invoked:  1) theories of unsaturation,  2)                     
              nitrogen compounds, and 3) the discovery and explanation of the                
              Walden inversion.  The story of the adoption of and resistance to              
              stereochemical principles reveals many assumptions and                         
              undercurrents in chemical theory of the late 19th century.   The               
              issues raised include the role of spatial properties in chemical               
              explanations, the reinterpretation of the old theoretical                      
              language of chemistry, the relationship between chemical theory                
              and chemical evidence, the shift in focus from composition to                  
              transformation, the autonomy of chemistry from physics, and the                
              peculiar concentration of stereochemists in Germany.
