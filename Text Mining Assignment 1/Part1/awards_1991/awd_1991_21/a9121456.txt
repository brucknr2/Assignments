Abstract    :
              9121456  Bolender       This project will create, using information
              technologies, a  new infrastructure for quantitative morphology (QM) in the
              life  sciences.  It includes: (1) software for tutorials, databases,  and query
              tools, (2) files of published data for 22 animal  organs, and (3) facilities
              for electronic submission of data.   The significance of the project is that it
              makes the methods and  data of QM readily available to the community, organizes
               structural information hierarchically, and provides new research  tools.  The
              new tutorial supplies training in QM, which include  morphometry, stereology,
              and reconstruction, through use of  detailed descriptions, worked examples,
              calculation workscreens,  simulations, and toolkits.  It provides: (1)
              background material  for biologists and computer scientists wishing to use the
              QM  databases and (2) state-of-the-art tools for researchers  interested in
              using these methods in the laboratory.  The  databases include a tutorial, data
              entry forms, published data  and query tools.  Reports allow end-users to
              standardize,  recycle, and create new data.  A new representation of QM data, 
              called the structural phenotype, simplifies the task of searching  for
              structural analogies and generalizations across the  literature.  The project
              actively supports the use of QM and  contributes a structural component to
              Biomatrix.  Furthermore the  investigator will begin to port his work to the
              workstation  environment.  This proposal is being jointly supported by the 
              Applications of Advanced Technology program in the Directorate  for Education
              and Human Resources as well as the Computational  Biology Activities program.
