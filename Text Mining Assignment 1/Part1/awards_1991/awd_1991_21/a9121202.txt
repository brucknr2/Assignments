Abstract    :
                   Three closely connected areas of violin acoustics are                     
              studied.  They all strive to enhance our understanding of the                  
              transient behavior and lack of exact periodicity of musical notes              
              played on bowed strong instruments.  Of particular importance is               
              the dynamics of the bow and the related issues of transients and               
              responsiveness of the violin to the bow.  The investigation uses               
              both computer analysis and an experimental apparatus to achieve                
              these goals.  Collaborations with Dr. J. Woodhouse of Cambridge                
              University and the use of the Pittsburgh Supercomputer Center                  
              support the investigation.
