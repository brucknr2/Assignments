Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A multidisciplinary approach is used to document the effects of                
              variations in salinity on the structure and function of a                      
              chemosensory system in the blue crab, a species that ranges from               
              seawater to freshwater.  Experiments focus upon the olfactory                  
              sensory cells of the crab, using animals acclimated to a range of              
              different external salt concentrations.  Using electron                        
              microscopy, the structural details of the sensory cells will be                
              examined to discover the features that may be transformed in                   
              altered salinity conditions.  The composition of the fluid, which              
              bathes the input processes of sensory neurons, is also monitored               
              in relation to salinity and its relationship to the hemolymph                  
              ("blood")  and the external environment of the crab.                           
              Neurophysiological techniques are used to define how the                       
              responses of chemically sensitive neurons are affected by altered              
              salinity, as well.  By integrating these approaches, we expect                 
              that this study will contribute to our understanding of                        
              structural and functional adaptations that can maintain                        
              chemosensory function under conditions of osmotic and ionic                    
              stress to the animal.
