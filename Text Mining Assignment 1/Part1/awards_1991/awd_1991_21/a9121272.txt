Abstract    :
              This project is a university-industry investigation of energy                  
              dissipation processes in solids which are bombarded by keV to MeV              
              ions or 10 eV to keV electrons.  After the diffusion of the                    
              deposited excited state energy and the emission of electrons, those            
              excitations that have not been quenched decay by the emission of               
              photons or by non-radiative processes such as the breaking of                  
              chemical bonds in a molecular solid and the production of                      
              significant atomic motions.  Experiments that detect ejected atoms,            
              molecules, electrons, ions and photons as well as IR studies of the            
              bombarded solids, will be used to develop models for the energy                
              deposition.  Theory and modeling are also part of the project.  The            
              results have applications in the deposition of metals on surfaces              
              and on processes in the microelectronics industry depending on ion             
              beam lithographic methods.
