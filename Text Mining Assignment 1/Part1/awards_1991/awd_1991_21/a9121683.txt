Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
                                                                                            
              This effort will provide the overall management for a US JGOFS                 
              Equatorial Pacific Process Study to be conducted                               
              during the Spring and Fall of 1992.  In addition, certain                      
              scientific services necessary for the completion of the project                
              will be provided:  ship use, hydrography, analysis of doppler                  
              current meter data, acquisition and archiving of satellite                     
              imagery, site mapping and sediment coring.  These services do not              
              stand alone as scientific research efforts, but are necessary                  
              to participating investigators and have been identified as                     
              critical to the success of the overall experiment by the US JGOFS              
              Steering Committee.  The US JGOFS Rational and Plan for                        
              Equatorial Pacific Process Studies, provides the overall                       
              scientific rationale and justification for an equatorial Pacific               
              process study; it also describes the conceptual plan and                       
              experimental strategy that has been endorsed by the US JGOFS                   
              Steering Committee and the scientists who want to take part in                 
              the study.
