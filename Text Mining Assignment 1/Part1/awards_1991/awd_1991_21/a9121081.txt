Abstract    :
              This is a two year cooperative research project proposed by Dr.                
              Jer-Ming Chiu, Memphis State University, and Professor Yeong Tein              
              Yeh, Academia Sinica, supported by the AIT (U.S.) - CCNAA                      
              (Taiwan) Cooperative Science Program.  This study plans to                     
              develop high-resolution 3-D crustal imaging for the Hualien area               
              of central Eastern Taiwan using the data collected by the PANDA                
              arrays.  The 3-D high-resolution structure/geological data are                 
              currently unavailable, but are useful in examining the                         
              relationship between the earthquake processes and their                        
              associated ground movement.  All instruments and the local field               
              expenses for this study are covered by the scientists in Taiwan                
              while the US-Taiwan Program, NSF provides the funds for three                  
              visitors travelling to Taiwan.  This is a cost-effective project               
              with significant gain to the U.S. earthquake research community.
