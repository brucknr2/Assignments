Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A major assumption of classical economic theory is that production             
              is governed by constant returns to scale.  This assumption forces              
              us to ignore one of the central features of economic life in the               
              last two centuries: the large industrial firm whose size is based              
              on the economic advantages of large-scale production.                          
                                                                                             
              Economists have long held the opinion that efficiencies of large-              
              scale production were caused by indivisibilities, i.e., large,                 
              lumpy aggregates of capital -- assembly lines, railroad and                    
              telephone networks, oil pipelines, bridges -- whose economic                   
              advantages could not be realized at low levels of production.                  
                                                                                             
              Indivisibilities can be introduced into a linear programming                   
              problem by requiring that some or all of the variables of choice               
              be restricted to integer values; the resulting programming problems            
              are extraordinarily difficult to solve.  One of the major projects             
              of the present proposal is the development of a new algorithm for              
              the solution of the general integer programming problem, which                 
              seems, from preliminary experience, to perform exceptionally well              
              on classes of problems which cannot be solved by earlier methods.              
              The investigator will also attempt to provide an economic                      
              interpretation of this algorithm in terms of the internal                      
              organization of the large-scale firm.
