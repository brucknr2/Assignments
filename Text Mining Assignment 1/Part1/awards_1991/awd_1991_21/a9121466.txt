Abstract    :
                   The research goal is to develop a successful and satisfactory             
              foundation of the theory of secure protocols by:                               
                                                                                             
                        o  Identifying the key quantities that govern the                    
                           security of distributed protocols,                                
                                                                                             
                        o  Devising the most general and robust notion of                    
                           secure computation that respects these identified                 
                           quantities, and                                                   
                                                                                             
                        o  Forging a set of tools for making it easier to prove              
                           or disprove the security of distributed protocols.
