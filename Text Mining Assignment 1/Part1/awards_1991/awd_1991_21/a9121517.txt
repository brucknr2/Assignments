Abstract    :
              In this Experimental Physical Chemistry project sponsored by                   
              the Chemistry Division, Prof. Woods (University of Wisconsin)                  
              will develop new methods of producing high density low                         
              temperature plasmas, optimized for producing molecular ions                    
              suitable for microwave structure determinations. The high                      
              resolution spectra obtainable by these techniques will yield                   
              accurate molecular geometries and dipole moments. The direct                   
              determination of electric dipole moments of charged molecules                  
              represents a new and unusual way of improving our understanding                
              of chemistry in electrically conducting media.

              Plasmas, a "fourth state" of matter, consist of a tremendously                 
              corrosive, reactive high temperature gas of electrically                       
              charged atoms or molecules. Prof. Woods' project in developing                 
              improved plasma sources and analyzing their microwave spectra                  
              has important implications for the chemistry of the                            
              interstellar medium and for plasma reactors used in materials                  
              processing.
