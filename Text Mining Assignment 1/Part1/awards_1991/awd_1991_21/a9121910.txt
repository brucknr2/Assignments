Abstract    :
              The nature of tribopolymerization will be studied for ceramic                  
              materials.  Special emphasis will be placed on the possibilty of               
              using the sliding process to generate insitu polymeric films                   
              which have useful triboligical properties.  The roles of local                 
              frictional heating and of exoelectrons in the polymerization                   
              processes will be studied.  The work is a collaborative effort                 
              between US and Polish scientists, performed primarily in the US.
