Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will study the structure of the                
              convective boundary layer over the tropical oceans as predicted by             
              the National Meteorological Center's (NMC) medium range (7-10 day)             
              forecast model.  The model's climatology will be compared with                 
              thermodynamic date produced with a radiative-convective equilibrium            
              model.  Energy budget calculations will be done to assess the                  
              deficiencies in the physics of the model and to evaluate the                   
              feedback between the boundary layer and the larger-scale model                 
              environment.  Sensitivity experiments will be designed to explore              
              how representation of atmospheric physical processes in the NMC                
              model can be improved.  An important task is to attempt to improve             
              the shallow cloud parameterization by explictly calculating the                
              cumulus momentum transport.                                                    
                   The research will be done in collaboration with scientists at             
              NMC as part of the NSF-NMC Joint Program in Numerical Weather                  
              Prediction.  This research will be an important contribution to the            
              improvement of operational medium weather forecasts and better                 
              understanding of the tropical convection boundary layer.
