Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Dr. Pramanik will develop a data management system for the U.S.                
              Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center located at Ohio State                   
              University, which is supported under DIR 9113224.  The center                  
              will collect, maintain, and distribute Arabidopsis seeds and                   
              other biological resources such as RFLP markers and YAC                        
              libraries.  An advisory committee consisting of active                         
              Arabidopsis researchers will advise the center on its policy and               
              overall operation.  The Center also provides information                       
              associated with the resources it maintains, including genetic                  
              data, biological history, and bibliography.  The research                      
              community will have access to this information either                          
              electronically or via regularly published catalogues.  The                     
              objective of this award is to develop necessary databases and                  
              software for the information service aspect of the Center.                     
                                                                                             
              The data management system to be developed will be flexible                    
              enough to allow additions and modifications to suit the changing               
              needs of the research community.  Initially, a user survey will                
              be carried out in collaboration with the International Plant                   
              Molecular Biology Society.  Continued input from the users will                
              be sought throughout the life of the project.  Dr. Pramanik plans              
              to coordinate his efforts with similar efforts by other genome                 
              informatics research groups in general and by the USDA plant                   
              genome informatics group in particular.
