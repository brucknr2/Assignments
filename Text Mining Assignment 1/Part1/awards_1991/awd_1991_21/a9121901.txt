Abstract    :
              Wolf         Research is on the relationship between high-level control 
              specifications and the finite state machine (FSM) implementation  of that
              control.  Models for two problems in high-level control  synthesis are being
              explored:  Analysis of delays in mixed data-  control systems before
              scheduling; and scheduling in complex  control systems.         The approach is
              to use the behavior FSM, a finite state  machine whose inputs and outputs are
              partially ordered in time.   The approach to solving the state minimization
              problem is to  search over possible schedules of input and output events to 
              choose an implementation of a minimum number of states.   Algorithms developed
              for compaction on a cylinder are being used  to move both simple outputs and
              branches to minimize the number  of states around cycles in a behavior state
              transition graph.
