Abstract    :
              Shape memory metals (SMMs) are a unique group of alloys which                  
              exhibit qualities of "memory" and "trainability."  These qualities             
              make such materials prime candidates for use in "smart"                        
              structures or as constituents in the development of certain                    
              advanced composite materials.                                                  
                                                                                             
              The use of these materials in structural applications requires                 
              proper constitutive characterization.  The goal of this work is                
              to design and conduct experiments on state of the art of shape                 
              memory metals in order to provide information for proper and                   
              complete continuum materials characterization.  The mechanical                 
              properties measured will form the basis for testing, validating                
              and calibrating appropriate theoretical models.
