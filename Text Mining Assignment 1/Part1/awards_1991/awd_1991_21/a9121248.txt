Abstract    :
              Technical Narrative:                                                           
              This U.S.-Egypt collaborative research project involving                       
              Northeastern University and Alexandria University is in the general            
              area of polymetallic chemistry.  This collaborative effort relates             
              to the metal exchange of polynuclear materials.  Project funding               
              will enable Drs. Mohamed A. El-Sayad and Ahmed El-Toukhy from                  
              Alexandria University, Egypt, to spend approximately three months              
              in the laboratory of Dr. Geoffrey Davies at Northeastern                       
              University.  Dr. Davies will visit and work at Alexandria                      
              University for a three month period as well.  The proposed new work            
              will build on the past efforts of the investigators including the              
              creation of larger and more diverse multi-metal molecules at lower             
              cost, and the use of these molecules as sources of new metal alloys            
              and chemical catalysts to be used in still newer systems.                      
              Development of the transmetalation phenomenon will lead to the                 
              establishment of new areas of study in organic and organometallic              
              chemistry.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              This project in polymetallic chemistry fulfills the program                    
              objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading                
              experts in the United States and Egypt to combine complementary                
              talents and pool research resources in areas of strong mutual                  
              interest and competence.
