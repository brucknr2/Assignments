Abstract    :
              In this research project supported by the Analytical and                       
              Surface Chemistry Program, Professor Jeanne Pemberton of the                   
              University of Arizona will carry out studies of the                            
              electrode-electrolyte interface using surface Raman                            
              spectroscopic and electrochemical characterization methods.                    
              Studies will be carried out in-situ, on emersed electrodes, and                
              on cryogenic models of the electrode-electrolyte interface.                    
              Information obtained from these studies is crucial to the                      
              molecular level understanding of electrochemical processes such                
              as sensor technology, solar energy conversion, and corrosion                   
              inhibition.

              Obtaining a detailed molecular level understanding of processes                
              occurring at the electrochemical interface is the goal of this                 
              research project supported by the Analytical and Surface                       
              Chemistry Program.  This information will be useful in the                     
              design of improved energy conversion devices, batteries, and                   
              corrosion inhibition strategies.
