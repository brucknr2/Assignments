              The Marine Biological Laboratory at Woods Hole, Mass. is one of the            
              finest facilities for basic biological research in the world.  A               
              great deal of their research is performed on biological specimens              
              which are collected on a daily basis form the ocean around the                 
              institute.  This award is to support the charter vessel which                  
              collects marine organisms for use in biological research.
