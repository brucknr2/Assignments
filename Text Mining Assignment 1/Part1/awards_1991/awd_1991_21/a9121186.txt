Abstract    :
              is award from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organo-                          
              metallic Program to Professor Jerry Atwood of the University of                
              Alabama will fund continued studies of guest-host chemistry                    
              involving calixarenes.  Calixarenes  are flexible, macrocycles                 
              (hosts) that can incorporate smaller molecules (guests) with                   
              multiple non-covalent interactions.  Emphasis will be on: 1)                   
              interactions with metal complexes as primary and second sphere                 
              ligands, 2) inclusion of water in the hydrophobic cavity of                    
              water soluble calix?4!arenes, 3) conformation and complexation                 
              of higher (n=5-8) calix?n!arenes, and 4) further                               
              characterization of bilayer solid state structures found for                   
              caliz?4!arene sulfonates and related compounds.  Information                   
              obtained from these studies on the nature of guest-host                        
              interactions will impact on separation science and biological                  
              chemistry.                                                                     
              %%%                                                                            
              This study is expected to provide important fundamental                        
              information about multiple, but highly specific, non-covalent                  
              interactions of molecules.  Such interactions are responsible                  
              for recognition of substrates by enzymes in biological systems                 
              and allow for the separation of mixtures of very similar                       
              molecules when appropriate hosts can be designed and                           
              synthesized.
