Abstract    :
                   This investigation focuses on  diel vertical migration by                 
              salps (pelagic tunicates) in the vicinity of the Bermuda Atlantic              
              Time Series Station.  Salps are efficient grazers on                           
              phytoplankton and other particulates; they are widely distributed              
              and sometimes occur in dense populations.  Several species                     
              migrate vertically, some as far as 800 m, while others are                     
              restricted to surface waters.  Recent work in the Subarctic                    
              Pacific and near Bermuda has revealed intriguing new features to               
              these migrations, which do not seem consistent with traditional                
              theories for the advantages of migration.  Salps in the Pacific                
              make shallow migrations, but stop feeding while at the surface                 
              during the night.  This behavior is believed to relate mainly to               
              spawning and fertilization.  Recently salps have been observed                 
              to consistently appeared at the surface at different times of day              
              - morning, afternoon and night.  This apparent migration is also               
              inconsistent with the usual explanations.                                      
                   Dr. Miller and collaborators will investigate the behavior                
              of this extremely important group of pelagic herbivores.  They                 
              will test two, non-exclusive  hypotheses for the migratory                     
              patterns observed:  1) migration optimizes feeding at food-rich                
              depths, or temporally partitions food among spatially co-                      
              occurring species; 2) migration concentrates salps at the                      
              surface and synchronizes spawning and fertilization.  The                      
              investigations address basic questions of adaptation and ecology               
              in migrating zooplankton, reproductive physiology of salps, and                
              competition and niche separation.  They are also critical for                  
              calculations of the role of grazing and migration by salps on                  
              vertical fluxes of particulate and dissolved nutrients.
