Abstract    :
              We propose to hold a U.S. Finnish Auroral Workshop in Helsinki                 
              from 19-21 March, 1992.  The purpose of the workshop will be to                
              review the past collaborations, to initiate new activities, and                
              to establish collaborative links between a new generation of                   
              scientists in both countries.  Significant new opportunities soon              
              will be available due to recent or upcoming initiatives in                     
              auroral, magnetospheric, and deep space research.  Finland has                 
              committed significant financial resources to space research and                
              has greatly expanded the number of young scientists.  Finnish                  
              scientists are presently operating major ground-based observation              
              facilities, and several groups are involved in the FREJA, POLAR,               
              CLUSTER, and INTERBALL spacecraft missions.  In the U.S., the                  
              National Science Foundation has begun a major new program,                     
              Geospace Environment Modeling (GEM), that could significantly                  
              benefit from U.S. - Finnish collaboration.  Working groups will                
              form to identify specific investigations for both near- and long-              
              term.  We expect 24 Finnish scientists to participate, of which                
              many are students and young scientists.  Forty U.S. scientists                 
              will be invited, and a large fraction of these are also young                  
              scientists.  In spite of the size of the workshop, limited funds               
              are requested, and the money will be used almost exclusively to                
              support the travel of young U.S. scientists who have not                       
              participated in previous U.S. - Finnish workshops.
