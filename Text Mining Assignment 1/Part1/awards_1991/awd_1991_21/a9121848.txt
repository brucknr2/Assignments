Abstract    :
                   This award is to purchase a multi-processor host machine                  
              for the Maspar computer and real-time high-speed, image                        
              capture and display hardware in order to support research in                   
              parallel real-time, high-speed computer vision and                             
              visualization.  The upgraded Maspar system will enable                         
              research to be conducted in the areas of artificial neural                     
              networks for robotics, factorization methods for shape and                     
              motion from image streams, road and terrain navigation,                        
              visualization techniques for relativistic imaging, and the                     
              development of a stereo vision machine.                                        
                                                                                             
              Research in parallel real-time computer vision and                             
              visualization is computationally expensive and requires both                   
              massively parallel computational power and real-time image                     
              I/O support.  Carnegie Mellon University will be upgrading                     
              their Maspar computer and adding real-time image acquisition                   
              hardware to support research projects in these areas.
