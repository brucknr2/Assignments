Abstract    :
              The magnetic properties of thin films of magnetic metals are to be             
              investigated by susceptibility, photoemission, and surface scanning            
              microscopy.  The cooperative magnetic behavior of these films                  
              depend on their thickness, a few atomic layers, and the specific               
              chemical compositions of the films.  Of particular interest is the             
              magnetic anisotropy in the films.  This can be tuned by alloying               
              the 3d ferromagnets iron, cobalt and nickel with nonmagnetic                   
              elements.  The epitaxial film compositions are not stable in bulk              
              materials, but can be stabilized in the thin film geometry.  The               
              magnetic properties of the thin films change dramatically with the             
              composition, which can be varied over wide ranges.  Thus materials             
              that originally ferromagnetic can be tuned to spin glass or other              
              magnetic order by changing the composition.
