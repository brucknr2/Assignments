Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                                         ABSTRACT                                            
                                                                                            
              This project completes the analysis and preparation for                        
              publication of work begun in 1989 on the Tibeto-Burman language                
              Chantyal, which belongs to the Gurung-Thakali-Tamang group within              
              the Bodic division of Tibeto-Burman, has never previously been                 
              described, and indeed its existence has only been recently noted               
              in the literature.  While still the principal language of a few                
              small villages in the Myagdi district of Nepal, the language is                
              threatened and may cease to be the principal medium of                         
              communication in these villages in the near future.                            
                                                                                             
              The goal of the project is to prepare for publication a                        
              comprehensive grammar, a dictionary/thesaurus, and a collection                
              of texts.  The grammar will be produced in a relatively non-                   
              theoretical, descriptive framework so as to be of maximum utility              
              to Sino-Tibetanists, anthropologists, and general linguists of                 
              various theoretical persuasions.  The grammar and                              
              dictionary/thesaurus will contain copious illustrations from both              
              elicted and textual material.  The texts will be chosen to                     
              exemplify several discourse types and a variety of cultural                    
              situations, will be accompanied by morpheme-by-morpheme glosses                
              as well as translations into idiomatic English, and will be keyed              
              to the grammar.
