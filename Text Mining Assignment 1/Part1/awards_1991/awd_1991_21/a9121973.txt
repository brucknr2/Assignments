Abstract    :
                   This award is to purchase a multiple degree of freedom,                   
              high precision, light weight stereo camera head.  The same                     
              equipment is being purchased at three other institution in a                   
              shared research effort.  Research topics include gaze control                  
              and target tracking, stereo and motion analysis, landmark-                     
              based navigation, automatic acquisition of object and                          
              environmental models, hands-eye coordination, dextrous                         
              manipulation with multi-fingered hands, real-time perception                   
              and manipulation.  System software, algorithms and subsystems                  
              will be shared across the institutions.                                        
                                                                                             
              The University of Pennsylvania will be purchasing equipment                    
              to support a multi-institutional shared research effort in                     
              active vision for robot navigation and manipulation.  Other                    
              members of the consortium are the University of Rochester,                     
              University of Maryland and the University of Massachusetts.                    
              Each institution will acquire the same stat-of-the-art                         
              binocular camera head of high precision and high speed, and                    
              will share in the development of systems software and                          
              applications software.
