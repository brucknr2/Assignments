Abstract    :
              The subject of this proposal is the design automation and rapid                
              prototyping of analog systems with initial emphasis on integrated              
              continuous-time filters, and uses the classical technique of                   
              signal-flow graph LC ladder simulation.  To exploit the increased              
              circuit density available in current technologies, it is important             
              to extend the range of analog design automation to larger                      
              subsystems.  By providing a methodology and software for the rapid-            
              prototyping of integrated continuous-time filters from a high-                 
              level, behavioral description, this research provides system                   
              designers with a tool to design new, tunable and/or programmable               
              integrated circuits for use in such areas as communications, mass              
              storage devices, and other continuous-time analog interfaces to                
              real world signals.  Related and equally important areas of                    
              research addressed in this project for integration of continuous-              
              time filters are tuning, compensation for parasitics, and scaling              
              for dynamic range.                                                             
                                                                                             
              The research is divided into three phases.  Phase 1 concentrates               
              on the manual and prototype software design and on MOSIS                       
              fabrication of CMOS TGC filters.  In Phase 2, the experimental                 
              results in cross talk, signal feed-through, excess phase and tuning            
              are used to refine the prototype software into a complete                      
              continuous-time analog filter synthesis tool.  Phase 3 focuses on              
              additional improvements of the software, such as optimization                  
              issues in the filter synthesis, on the number of identical                     
              transconductance macro-cells and capacitors used to realize a                  
              signal-flow graph simulation of an LC filter, use of multi-input               
              transconductors, and other realization methods, such as element                
              substitution and cascade of biquads.
