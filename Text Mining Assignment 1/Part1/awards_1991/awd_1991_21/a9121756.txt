Abstract    :
              The purpose of the proposal is to significantly enhance the                    
              quantity and quality of our current data base of digital images                
              of solar active regions and activity by providing funds to                     
              purchase the recording equipment needed to save approximately                  
              5,500 images per day from the five full-time SOON observations                 
              located around the world.  We plan to install dual Exabyte 2.3                 
              Gbyte tape drives at the five sites and to archive approximately               
              1,100 selected images per day per site.  The purpose for this                  
              archival process is to make these invaluable data available to                 
              the entire scientific community for detailed studies of flares                 
              and active region evolution.  The effort is intended to augment                
              the infrastructure of the solar physics community by providing an              
              unprecedented continuous coverage of the majority of solar active              
              regions with high spatial resolution and moderate temporal                     
              resolution.  We believe that the creation of the proposed                      
              archival data base of SOON images will form a major cornerstone                
              of observations relating to flare triggering, flare build-up and               
              energetics as well as active region evolution.  This nearly                    
              continuous solar data set needs to be saved and placed (in a                   
              convenient way) in the hands of the solar physics community and                
              compared with other data to provide new understandings of solar                
              flares.
