Abstract    :
                   The impact of orography on winter storms has been recognized              
              for several decades.  It has been established that terrain of                  
              significant relief impacts local weather and current numerical                 
              models often do not accurately forecast extreme weather phenomena              
              that are influenced by the local terrain.                                      
                   Using data collected from two already completed field programs            
              (Genesis of Atlantic Lows Experiment and the Stormscale,                       
              Operational and Research Meteorology-Fronts Experiment, Systems                
              Test), the Principal Investigators will conduct numerical and                  
              observational studies of the structure and evolution of fronts and             
              associated mesoscale weather systems along the East Coast and the              
              continental United States.  Particular attention will be paid to               
              mesoscale rapid frontogenesis and subsequent mesoscale cyclogenesis            
              over the East Coast when synoptic-scale flow is impeded by the                 
              Appalachian Mountains.  Documentation of scale interactions between            
              the synoptic-scale flow patterns and resulting mesoscale weather               
              will be emphasized.
