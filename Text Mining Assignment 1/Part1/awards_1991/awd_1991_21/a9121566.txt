Abstract    :
                This grant is to provide research and travel support for the                 
              principal investigator and his graduate student Mr. Emmanuel                   
              Ramos, a native of the Philippines, to analyze seismic data                    
              related to the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo, Luzon.  The major                     
              eruption, beginning in June, 1991, was the largest in Philippine               
              history and is one of the largest of this century.  Mr. Ramos is               
              a Philippine seismologist, currently on study leave from the                   
              Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology, and has been               
              involved in seismic monitoring of active volcanoes in the                      
              Philippines for approximately ten years.  His work will aid in                 
              analysis of the current eruption and in evaluation of other                    
              volcanos that appear to be increasing in activity.  This proposal              
              is submitted under the SGER program for research having a severe               
              urgency with regard to availability of or access to data.  This                
              research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard                      
              Reduction Program and a contribution to the International Decade               
              for Natural Disaster Reduction program.
