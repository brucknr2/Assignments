Abstract    :
                   The subject of symplectic topology goes back to Poincare's                
              work on celestial mechanics.  The first result in this area was                
              the so-called "Poincare's geometric theorem," proved some twenty               
              years later.  Recent progress in symplectic topology started in                
              the early 1980's with proofs of some of Arnold's conjectures                   
              which had remained unresolved for twenty years.  Major                         
              developments have occurred in the last several years; modern                   
              symplectic topology is intimately linked with Morse theory of                  
              functionals unbounded from above and below, the theory of pseudo-              
              holomorphic curves in almost-complex manifolds, the theory of                  
              instantons, low-dimensional topology and knot theory.                          
                   This project will support the Conference on Symplectic                    
              Topology to be held from April 9-11, 1992 at the University of                 
              Arkansas, Fayetteville.  The conference will focus on recent                   
              developments and will represent different approaches to the                    
              problems of symplectic topology and provide an opportunity to                  
              exchange ideas on unresolved problems.
