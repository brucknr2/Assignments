Abstract    :
              This U.S.-Mexico award will support a research                                 
              workshop on the topic of numerical transport theory.                           
              The workshop, which will take place in College                                 
              Station, Texas September 1992, is being organized by                           
              Professors Paul Nelson and Professor G. D. Allen,                              
              both of Texas A&M University, and Professor Jean                               
              Pierre Hennart of the Instituto de Investigaciones                             
              en Matematicas Aplicadas of the Universidad Nacional                           
              Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM).                                                     
                                                                                             
              The primary purpose of the workshop is to provide a                            
              venue in which experts in the field of numerical                               
              transport theory can identify joint scientific                                 
              priorities and potential research partnerships                                 
              within currently ongoing research and even lay                                 
              preliminary long-term plans for joint research                                 
              projects. A significant feature of this workshop                               
              will be the inclusion of graduate students from the                            
              U.S. and Mexico.
