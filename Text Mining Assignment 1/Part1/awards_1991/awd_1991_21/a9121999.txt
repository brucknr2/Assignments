Abstract    :
                   This award provides funds to build an FDDI LAN using existing             
              fiber cable, with network analyzer and logic analyzer interface.               
              This local area network will support research projects in queuing              
              and control theoretic algorithms for rate based flow control, high-            
              performance network interoperability modelling, impact of                      
              application-network interaction on high data rate network                      
              performance, multimedia information on a distributed system, and               
              high performance FDDI networks for VSAT internetworking.                       
                                                                                             
              Equipment will be purchased to assemble a campus-wide Fiber                    
              Distributed-Data Interface (FDDI) network to support experimental              
              communications research as well as to provide a testbed for                    
              distributed multimedia.  Research projects supported include the               
              development and implementation of a new rate control algorithm for             
              local area networks (LAN), interoperability modeling, optimal                  
              organization and performance of distributed systems based on high              
              data rate LAN's, and network-aided construction and access to                  
              digital multimedia information.
