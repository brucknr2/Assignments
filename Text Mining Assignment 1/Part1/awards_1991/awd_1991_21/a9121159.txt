Abstract    :
              This is a one year cooperative research project proposed by Dr.                
              Joris Gieskes, the University of California at San Diego and                   
              Professor Typhoon Lee, Academia Sinica, supported by the AIT                   
              (U.S.) - CCNAA (Taiwan) Cooperative Science Program.  This                     
              project plans to study the geochemistry of fluids and solids of                
              mud volcanos.  Mud volcanos are thought to originate deep inside               
              tectonic plate wedges and can provide important indication to the              
              formation of accretionary prisms.  Dr. Gieskes is a leading                    
              scientist in geochemical research.  Taiwan is an ideal place for               
              this study since it is situated at the area where the Philippines              
              Plate collides with the Asian Continent.  The mud volcanos are                 
              uniquely suited for this study.   This project can provide                     
              important information to the U.S. researchers for understanding a              
              geochemical cycle in active hydrothermal areas currently                       
              characterized by limited existing data.
