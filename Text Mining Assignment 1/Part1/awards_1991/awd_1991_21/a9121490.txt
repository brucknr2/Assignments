Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Recent research on investment decisions under uncertainty has                  
              highlighted the importance of option values, or of waiting to                  
              resolve some uncertainty and gather more information.  This work               
              is mostly restricted to "classical" economic environments, with                
              perfect risk markets and without economies of scale or                         
              externalities.  This project extends the analysis to "non-                     
              classical" settings, using corresponding extensions of techniques              
              of stochastic optimal control.  The more general theory will then              
              be applied to some important policy issues.  Examples include the              
              following.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              (1) Criteria for investment under uncertainty with scale economies             
              and externalities will be developed, built into a model of industry            
              evolution, and linked to the new theory of growth.  (2) Since labor            
              income risk is hard or impossible to diversify, trade adjustment,              
              and more generally job losses due to plant closure, alter risk-                
              bearing.  The issue, and appropriate policies, will be modelled.               
              (3) Real rigidities of slow adjustment will be combined with                   
              nominal inertia into macroeconomic models of employment                        
              fluctuations.  (4) When evaluating new technologies to reduce                  
              environmental damage, the value of waiting to gather more                      
              information must be traded off against the risk of irreversible                
              damage while we wait.  This will be formulated as a stochastic                 
              control problem with filtering.
