Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This is a proposal to study how characteristics of                        
              communities influence the occurrence and timing of several                     
              dimensions of the transition to adulthood, for example the                     
              decision to get married, and to have the first child.  The study               
              will focus in particular on the relationship between out-of-                   
              wedlock childbearing and the relative availability of marriage                 
              partners in a community, and on the degree to which community                  
              characteristics can account for racial and ethnic differences in               
              the transition to adulthood.                                                   
                   Data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY)                
              will be linked with data for counties and metropolitan areas from              
              the Census and other sources.  Event history models will be                    
              estimated to determine the impact of the community level                       
              variables on the transition to adulthood.                                      
                   This study will provide a valuable contribution to a large                
              literature on the transition to adulthood in American society.                 
              Its unique contribution will be to shed light on how the                       
              communities in which young people live may affect the choices and              
              decisions they make early in life in particular with respect to                
              decisions about childbearing, marriage, and sexual activity.
