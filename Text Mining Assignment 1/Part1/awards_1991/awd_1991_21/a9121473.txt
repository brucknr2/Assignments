Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will be used at Lowell Observatory to develop a new                 
              generation of photometers based on Charge Coupled Devices (CCD) for            
              use in observing occultations of stars by objects in the Solar                 
              System.  When compared with conventional high-speed photometers                
              that use photomultipliers, a CCD-based photometer provides much                
              greater quantum efficiency over a broader wavelength range, the                
              ability to guide the telescope directly from the CCD image, and the            
              ability to construct a much smaller synthetic photometric aperture             
              after the fact that tracks image motion and can be optimized for               
              changing seeing conditions.  As a result, the CCD-based photometer             
              provides a substantially greater signal-to-noise ratio than the                
              traditional photometer for a given event, and it allows useful                 
              observations of the more numerous events involving fainter stars               
              to be made.  The high-speed CCD photometer must be portable in                 
              order to be used with a portable telescope or a fixed telescope                
              that happens to lie within an occultation path.
