Abstract    :
                   The contractor will carry out the 1992 Survey of Academic                 
              Research Facilities, a sample survey of higher education                       
              institutions that collects data on the status and condition of                 
              science and engineering research facilities.  A "Quick Response                
              Survey" was conducted in 1986 followed by a more detailed full                 
              scale facilities survey in 1988.  A followup to the 1988 survey                
              was conducted in 1990.  Tasks involved in the 1992 survey will                 
              include conduct of data collection activities, tabulation of data              
              results, provision of technical support as required for the                    
              National Science Foundation's own analytical uses of the data,                 
              and production of a final analytical report summarizing the                    
              results of the study, for submission to Congress in September                  
              1992.  A second analytical report on the biomedical sciences will              
              be prepared for the National Institutes of Health, co-sponsors of              
              the study.                                                                     
                   The Authorization Act of 1985 (Public Law 99-159) directed                
              NSF to "...design, establish, and maintain a data collection and               
              analysis capability in the Foundation for the purpose of                       
              identifying and assessing research facilities needs of                         
              universities."  This study, initiated in response to the above                 
              mandate, provides quantitative and qualitative information on the              
              amount, cost, and condition of existing research facilities as                 
              well as current and planned construction and repair/renovation                 
              activities, including the sources of funding for these capital                 
              projects.
