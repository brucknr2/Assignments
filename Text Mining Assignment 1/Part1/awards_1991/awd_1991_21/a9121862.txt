Abstract    :
              This grant supports research to gain                                           
              a detailed understanding of the                                                
              influence of chemical composition on                                           
              the higher order plane selectivity                                             
              in silicon anisotropic etching.  A                                             
              polished single crystal silicon                                                
              sphere, 0.25 inches in diameter is                                             
              chosen for the study because it                                                
              provides a systematic tool to                                                  
              measure the plane selectivity in the                                           
              various etches.  Two critical                                                  
              questions will be addressed:  the                                              
              role of the cation in aqueous                                                  
              solutions, and the role of alcohol                                             
              and other additives to the                                                     
              anisotropy of the etching.  The                                                
              visualization of three dimensional                                             
              micromachined structures will assist                                           
              in the design of complex                                                       
              microstructures.
