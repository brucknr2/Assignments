Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Opiod receptors of the brain are important in understanding                    
              mechanisms of central nervous system processing of the perception              
              of pain or discomfort.  Under a variety of conditions the numbers              
              and sensitivity of these receptors be regulated (up- or down-                  
              regulated to adjust the nervous system sensitivity to these                    
              chemicals.  It is unknown where these receptors are normally                   
              located or the mechanism of their regulation, i.e., the balance                
              between synthesis, degradation and recycling.  These studies will              
              provide new information on the mechanism and sites of action of                
              pharmacological agents that may activate or alter these receptors.
