Abstract    :
              This project will create and                                                   
              validate an analytical model for                                               
              the complex behavior of unanchored                                             
              liquid-filled tanks during an                                                  
              earthquake.  This type of analysis                                             
              is complicated, because the bases                                              
              of these tanks separate from and                                               
              lift off their foundations during                                              
              strong ground motion excitations.                                              
              This base uplift changes the                                                   
              dynamic behavior of these                                                      
              structures considerably and leads                                              
              to severe loading conditions that                                              
              can lead to stress or buckling                                                 
              failures and subsequent loss of                                                
              contents.  To advance the design of                                            
              such structures, the response of                                               
              the tank and its contents due to                                               
              both lateral and vertical base                                                 
              excitation must be modeled.
