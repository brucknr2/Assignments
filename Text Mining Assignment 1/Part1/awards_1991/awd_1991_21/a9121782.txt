Abstract    :
              In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the                       
              Chemistry Division, Prof. Peter Siska of the University of                     
              Pittsburgh will study crossed molecular beam reactions                         
              involving noble gas atoms with other atoms or diatomic                         
              molecules.  Specifically, Penning and associative ionization                   
              dynamics will be investigated using Penning ionization electron                
              spectroscopy (PIES).  Also included are theoretical studies of                 
              the scattering of metastable noble gases by atoms and molecules                
              on a state-specific level.                                                     
              %%%                                                                            
              When an electronically excited atom A* meets a molecule BC, the                
              atom may lose its energy by a variety of pathways.  In some                    
              circumstances the loss of the atom's energy results in the                     
              ejection of an electron from the intermediate molecular                        
              complex, leaving a positively charged ion, which may be ABC+,                  
              BC+, or AB+.  Such processes are known by the name "Penning                    
              ionization" and have been used to elucidate the electronic or                  
              molecular structure of large organic molecules, adsorbates on                  
              metal surfaces, and even liquid surfaces.  These applications                  
              are possible because Penning ionization is sensitive to the                    
              spatial extent and shape of individual molecular orbitals, that                
              is, the molecule's electron clouds.  In this project various                   
              reactions involving Penning ionization will be examined in                     
              order to answer some basic questions regarding the mechanism by                
              which this process works.
