Abstract    :
              Two workshops will be held to evaluate the current state of finite             
              deformation elastic-plastic constitutive models, the appropriate               
              experimental bases for these models, the range and regimes of                  
              validity, and the utility of such models.  Similar efforts are                 
              underway in Japan and Germany, and the workshop coordinators will              
              interface the US effort with these ongoing international efforts.
