Abstract    :
                   Professor Mandel will study some of the most                              
              counterintuitive aspects of quantum optics involving                           
              nonlocality and entangled quantum states.  Mandel's group will                 
              carry out experiments on interference effects in light beams                   
              which show that even widely separated photons, derived                         
              simultaneously from the same light source, will interfere                      
              quantum mechanically where no classical analogue exists.  The                  
              experiments are aimed at a deeper understanding of nonlocality                 
              and indistinguishability in quantum phenomena which may point                  
              the way to a more general theory of quantum mechanics of which                 
              the current version may only be a local approximation.
