Abstract    :
                   This project is concerned with the design of a new                        
              Reformulation-Linearization Technique (RLT) and the development of             
              its application to various classes of problems arising in                      
              production, location-allocation, economics, and various engineering            
              and systems design and operational contexts.  At the heart of this             
              methodology is a procedure developed under a previous National                 
              Science Foundation project for generating tight, higher                        
              dimensional, linear programming representations for linear and                 
              polynomial zero-one mixed-integer programming problems.  The basic             
              RLT procedure possesses a considerable degree flexibility that can             
              be exploited to develop effective algorithmic variants.  Various               
              transformations and implementation schemes will be investigated in             
              order to enhance the capability in solving both discrete and                   
              continuous nonconvex decision problems.  The utility of the RLT                
              scheme in generating facets and tight valid inequalities for                   
              important discrete classes of problems will also be explored.  This            
              will benefit other algorithms for mixed-integer zero-one problems.             
                   The methodology developed will be specialized to solve                    
              indefinite and concave quadratic programs, linear complementarily              
              problems, location-allocation problems, and fixed-charge problems              
              that arise in the different aforementioned applications.
