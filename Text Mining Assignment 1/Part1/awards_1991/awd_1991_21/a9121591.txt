Abstract    :
              This award form the Synthetic Organic Program will enable the                  
              participation of U.S. chemists in the XII International                        
              Conference on Phosphorus Chemistry which is being held in                      
              Toulouse, France, July 6-10, 1992. Phosphorus chemistry                        
              includes a plethora of exciting areas of research.  The                        
              organization of the Conference will allow for discussion of a                  
              broad range of themes including the synthesis of organic                       
              phosphorus compounds, the chemistry of phosphorus compounds                    
              with unusual coordination and bonding characteristics, the                     
              chemistry of coordination compounds involving directly bound                   
              phosphorus ligands, the biochemistry of organophosphorus                       
              compounds, the chemistry of phosphates, physical methods and                   
              theoretical chemistry as applied to phosphorus, and new                        
              polymeric materials containing phosphorus. The Conference                      
              affords a unique opportunity for U.S. Chemists, including young                
              investigators, to interact with their counterparts from around                 
              the world for an intense interchange of knowledge and to                       
              prepare the foundation for long term international                             
              collaborations.
