Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award supports continuation of work begun under a Small Grant             
              for Exploratory Research.  The heart of the work is the utilization            
              of an important new astronomical instrument, a spectropolarimeter              
              at the Palomar five meter telescope, to study the nuclei of active             
              galaxies.  The use of polarimetry enables one to infer properties              
              of the central object of such systems, even when they are obscured             
              by intervening dust in the parent galaxy.  This instrument was                 
              designed, built, and will be operated by the group that has led the            
              way in the study of apparent superluminal motion in some of these              
              objects.
