Abstract    :
              It is proposed to conduct research                                             
              on the design of robust output                                                 
              feedback control of a class of                                                 
              nonlinear systems.  The class of                                               
              systems to be considered is the                                                
              class of input-output linearizable                                             
              systems, which arise in many                                                   
              applications such as robotic                                                   
              manipulators, aircraft control, and                                            
              electric machines.  The design                                                 
              procedure starts with the design of                                            
              a robust state feedback control                                                
              followed by the design of a robust                                             
              observer to recover robustness                                                 
              achieved with state feedback.  The                                             
              performance of such observers are                                              
              usually hindered by difficulties due                                           
              to measurement noise and excessively                                           
              large transient response.  A recent                                            
              result by the principal investigator                                           
              has shown that, for the special case                                           
              of fully linearizable systems, the                                             
              undesirable transient behavior can                                             
              be eliminated by designing the                                                 
              feedback control to be globally                                                
              bounded.  This proposal aims at                                                
              developing a comprehensive theory                                              
              for the design of globally bounded                                             
              output feedback controllers.                                                   
              Problems to be investigated include                                            
              tracking, disturbance rejection                                                
              servomechanisms, robustness,                                                   
              comparison of various state                                                    
              estimation schemes, and study the                                              
              effect of measurement noise.
