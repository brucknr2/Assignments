Abstract    :
                   This award provides one-half the funding needed for the                   
              acquisition of computing equipment that will be installed and                  
              maintained in the Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics                
              (IGPP) at the University of California, San Diego. The institution             
              is committed to providing the remaining funds necessary for this               
              acquisition.                                                                   
                   A consortium of investigators at IGPP will use the new                    
              computer system in their work in marine seismic methods,                       
              interpretation of mid-ocean ridge processes, global seismology,                
              mantle convection, geomagnetism, space-based geodesy and other                 
              computer-intensive research projects.
