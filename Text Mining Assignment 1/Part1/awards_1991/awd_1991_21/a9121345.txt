Abstract    :
              This is a small grant for exploratory research.  Experiments will              
              be conducted in order to determine the feasibility of an assay for             
              eukaryotic transcription termination based on the polymerase chain             
              reaction (PCR).  The underlying concept is that PCR should be able             
              to detect vanishingly small quantities of a specific nucleic acid              
              in the presence of large excess of non-specific competitor.  The               
              assay to be developed will be designed to detect the nascent RNAs              
              that are the products of transcription using PCR.  The study                   
              involves a number of untested assumptions and this award will test             
              those assumptions.  If successful, the research will lead to a                 
              relatively simple and quick way to study eukaryotic transcription              
              termination.
