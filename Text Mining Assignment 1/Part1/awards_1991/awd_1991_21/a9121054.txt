Abstract    :
              The 19th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture will          
              be held May 19-21, 1992 in Queensland, Australia.  It is co-sponsored          
              by the Association for Computing Machinery and the IEEE.  Since 1980,          
              the symposium has been held outside the U.S. about every three years.          
              The grant provides travel support for 20 U.S. scientists to attend the         
              symposium.
