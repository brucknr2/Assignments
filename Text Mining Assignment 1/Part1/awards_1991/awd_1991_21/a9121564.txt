Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Most recently the dissolution of the Soviet Union, but also               
              the preceding experiments with democracy by Eastern European                   
              countries and the return to democracy in several Latin American                
              countries have heightened international interest in democracy.                 
              Essential to advancing our knowledge of the causes and consequences            
              of liberal democracy--the extent that a political system allows                
              political liberties and democratic rule--as well as to policy                  
              decisions facilitating democratic initiatives is the accurate                  
              measurement of democracy.  The goal of this continuation project               
              is to advance the measurement of liberal democracy of countries.               
              The project will complete a cross-national time series (1950-1990)             
              data set containing indicators of liberal democracy.  Measurement              
              models to estimate the validity, source biases, and random errors              
              in the indicators will be developed.                                           
                                                                                             
                   In this veritable age of democratization, access to the data              
              set developed in this project will permit systematic comparative               
              time series analyses by political sociologists and political                   
              scientists of the causes and consequences of democracy on a variety            
              of political and economic conditions.  The project's findings on               
              the measurement properties of the indicators of liberal democracy              
              will be useful not only to the scholarly community, but also to a              
              number of U.S. government and international agencies that are                  
              seeking ways of assessing democratic developments in countries.
