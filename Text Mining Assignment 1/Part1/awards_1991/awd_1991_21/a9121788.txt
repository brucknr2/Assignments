Abstract    :
              In this project, the PI's will participate in an international                 
              expedition (called HYDRO-BLACK) to measure the chemistry, biology,             
              and hydrography of the Black Sea in a period of about 2-weeks in               
              early September, 1991, to give a nearly synoptic description of                
              the circulation.  Six ships will be involved, 3 from the Soviet                
              Union, 2 from Turkey, and 1 from Bulgaria, with scientists from                
              Romania and the USA participating.  The data set obtained will be              
              unprecedented in both quality and synopticity, and will allow the              
              PI's to describe the general two-gyre circulation thought to be                
              present, determine momentum balances, address the question of wind             
              or buoyancy driving, and investigate the role of shallow margins               
              in determining the total chemical balance and modulating the                   
              exchange processes and anoxia within the deeper waters.
