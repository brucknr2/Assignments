Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project supports the dissertation research of a student of                
              cultural anthropology in a fishing region of Tanzania.  The                    
              project will investigate how recent projects of economic                       
              development have impacted the roles and status of women.  Using                
              ethnographic methodology of participant observation, structured                
              interviews and examination of archives the study will describe                 
              the nature of women's involvement in the artesenal fishing                     
              industry and attempt to understand the impacts of recent                       
              development projects on the status of women.  The student is                   
              well-prepared for the research by virtue of previous experiences               
              in Africa on fishery development projects.                                     
                                                                                             
              This research is important because it will add a case study to                 
              the literature on the (detrimental) impact of development on                   
              women, with special focus on means by which projects can benefit               
              women (and the dependent children they care for).  Focusing on                 
              this issue in a fishing community will provide information of                  
              value to development planners, to avoid the mistakes of the past               
              whereby development projects were keyed to the needs of men on                 
              the assumption that the benefits would flow directly to women and              
              children.
