Abstract    :
                   This project develops further new mathematical, statistical               
              and computational methods for the empirical estimation of                      
              response functions of several to many variables.  Data may be                  
              direct, indirect or only on functions implicitly defined.  The                 
              new spline smoothing will be extended to analysis of variance                  
              techniques.  Particular problems include model selection (choice               
              of model components to include), improved computational methods                
              to allow efficient fitting with many variables and very large                  
              data sets, development of methods appropriate to binomial and                  
              other non-Gaussian responses and to implicit problems.                         
                   Statistical models are intended to predict outcomes given                 
              specified values of the predictor variables or to describe the                 
              relationships between predictors and outcomes, or to see how                   
              responses may change as predicting factors or attributes change.               
              Developing empirical statistical models using smoothing splines                
              promises to be widely applicable in scientific research, ranging               
              from the search for risk factors in large scale demographic data               
              or for risk factors in environmental degradation, to aspects of a              
              numerical weather forecasting system, to machine learning.
