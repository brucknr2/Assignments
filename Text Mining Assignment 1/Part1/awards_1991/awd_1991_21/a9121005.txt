Abstract    :
                   A major theme of twentieth century mathematics has been the               
              deep connections between group theory and geometry and topology.               
              This connection began with Poincare's discovery of the notion of               
              the fundamental group of a space.  One of the most interesting                 
              aspects of this connection is the relationship between group                   
              theory and curvature in particular, nonpositive curvature.  The                
              1980's saw a new influx of ideas in this last area including the               
              following:  (1) work on "word hyperbolic groups," that is, a                   
              class which contains all groups which can act properly and                     
              cocompactly on negatively curved spaces, (2) the recognition of                
              the algorithmic character of such groups leading to the                        
              introduction of the notion of "automatic groups," (3) the study                
              of groups acting on trees and R-trees, (4) work on polyhedra and               
              orbihedra of nonpositive curvature and applications to complexes               
              of groups, and (5) the Novikov conjecture for word hyperbolic                  
              groups and work on topological rigidity of nonpositively curved                
              manifolds.                                                                     
                   This project will support a research quarter in Nonpositive               
              Curvature and Geometric Group Theory to be held at the Ohio State              
              University during the Spring Quarter of 1992.  The activity will               
              include both long and short term visitors, as well as a                        
              conference which will be held during the first week of June 1992.
