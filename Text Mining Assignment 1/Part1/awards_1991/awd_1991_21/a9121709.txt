Abstract    :
                   This award is for an upgrade of a MasPar MP-1 massively                   
              parallel computer to enable computational applications in                      
              information sciences and systems, and in condensed matter and                  
              material physics.  Research projects include compression of                    
              high-definition images, distributed decision-making with very                  
              large numbers of sensors, Monte Carlo simulations of glassy                    
              systems, and numerical studies of quantum disordered systems.                  
                                                                                             
              The acquisition of MasPar machines has allowed a number of                     
              academic, government and industrial organizations to achieve                   
              exceptionally fast computing performance for scientific and                    
              engineering applications amenable to massive parallelism.                      
              Princeton University plans to use the machine for several                      
              research projects in the Electronic Materials and devices                      
              group, and in the Information Sciences and Systems group.
