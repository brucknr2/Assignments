Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is the development of a new                      
              method based on carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance chemical                  
              shifts for determining thermodynamic acidity functions for                     
              liquid and solid acids.  Medium effects are eliminated by                      
              using the difference in chemical shift between two carbon                      
              atoms in the same molecule as the measurement parameter.  The                  
              new method is applicable to systems lacking the transparency                   
              to visible and ultraviolet light required for use of                           
              traditional Hammett indicators, and is extendable to solids.                   
              To relate solid acidity to solution acidity, the protonation                   
              equilibrium of indicator bases in solution is studied at the                   
              stoichiometric acid-to-base ratio and the same indicator bases                 
              are then studied on solid acids at equimolar ratios of base to                 
              acid sites.  Finally, the effects of solvents on acid                          
              strengths is examined.                                                         
                                                                                             
              Although the concept of acidity is often used to interpret the                 
              effects of solid catalysts, there is, in fact, no sound                        
              technique to measure or quantify this property for solids.                     
              This project addresses this problem directly; success would                    
              provide a more rational framework for understanding of many                    
              catalytic systems, and also of corrosion, composite stability,                 
              and chromophoric displays.
