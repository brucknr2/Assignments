Abstract    :
                   In the past few years, the field of low-dimensional topology              
              has undergone expansion.  The theory has significantly widened in              
              scope and has made use of more and more diverse techniques.  The               
              theory has branched out into such varied areas as combinatorial                
              group theory, differential geometry, algebraic geometry and                    
              physics in general, spectral theory, representation theory, gauge              
              theory, and others.  Moreover, the role of computers in the                    
              theory of low-dimensional topology has become increasingly                     
              important.                                                                     
                   This project will support the Conference on Low-Dimensional               
              Topology to be held in May 1992 at the University of Tennessee,                
              Knoxville.  The major areas to be covered in this conference are:              
              (1) negatively curved groups and actions on R-trees, (2) minimal               
              surfaces in low-dimensional topology, (3) hyperbolic 3-manifolds               
              and their representations, (4) combinatorial 3-manifold theory,                
              and (5) gauge theoretic aspects of 3-manifolds.  This conference               
              will be held as part of a special emphasis year in topology being              
              held at the University of Tennessee during the 1991-92 academic                
              year.
