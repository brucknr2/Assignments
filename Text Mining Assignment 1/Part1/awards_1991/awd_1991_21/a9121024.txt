              experimental methods on mass-flow                                              
              and instrumentation now used for                                               
              detecting and measuring this type

              Mud and debris flows are among the                                             
              most hazardous, and not well                                                   
              understood, natural phenomena that                                             
              frequently cause extensive damage                                              
              around the world.  Improvements in                                             
              the knowledge base through research                                            
              will result in better mitigation
