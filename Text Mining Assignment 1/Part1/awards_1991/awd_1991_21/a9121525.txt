Abstract    :
              An International Symposium on the History of Particle Physics is               
              being held at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center from June 24-             
              27, 1992.  This is the third in a series of such gathering that                
              began at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in 1980.  A                 
              primary goal of these meetings is to identify principal themes and             
              critical problems, thereby laying the basis for future historical              
              studies of an important area of modern physics.  Themes to be                  
              explored in this symposium include the growth of large                         
              international scientific collaborations, the transition from fixed-            
              target to colliding beam modes of experimentation, the unification             
              of the weak and the electromagnetic forces, and the development of             
              the quark model of elementary particles.  While concentrating on               
              the "Rise of the Standard Model" in particle physics, the symposium            
              is not ignoring particle physics outside of this mainstream--eg.               
              papers are being given on the discovery of CP-violation.  By                   
              bringing together a group of prominent scientists together with                
              leading historians, sociologists and philosophers of science, the              
              organizers aim to promote interdisciplinary collaboration in                   
              writing the history of recent science and to develop further the               
              methodology of using personal recollections of major contributors              
              as a tool for historical research.  The proceedings of the                     
              symposium are being carefully edited, extensively referenced and               
              supplemented with an introduction that discusses the historical                
              context in which the development of the standard model occurred.
