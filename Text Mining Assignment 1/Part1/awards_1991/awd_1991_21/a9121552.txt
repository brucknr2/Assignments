Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Physical anthropology faces a significant challenge as large                   
              skeletal collections are repatriated and buried pursuant to the                
              Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act.  In an                 
              effort to salvage valuable scientific information, physical                    
              anthropologists have compiled protocols for the gathering of                   
              standardized data.  The primary objective of this project is the               
              creation of a computerized database system which will allow the                
              entry, retrieval and storage of medical and osteological                       
              information recorded for human skeletal remains.  The system                   
              implements the data standards developed by an NSF supported                    
              workshop held at the Field Museum in 1991.  In addition to                     
              personal computer based versions of the system, an on-line                     
              INTERNET accessible national archive will be created with upload               
              and download capabilities.
