              Funding is requested for a one day program, "Minorities in Biology:            
              Opportunities for Growth" to be held August 7, 1991 at the 42nd                
              annual meeting of AIBS in San Antonio, Texas.  The program will                
              consist of a morning program for high school students in the local             
              region, a buffet lunch for students and teachers, an afternoon                 
              symposium, and an evening reception for all participants in the                
              meeting.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              The goals of the program include:                                              
                                                                                             
                   1.   To inform high school and college students of ethnic                 
                        minority groups about career opportunities in biology and            
                        to provide personal acquaintance with biologists of                  
                        ethnic minority groups;                                              
                                                                                             
                   2.   to increase contact between ethnic minority biologists               
                        and other professional biologists; and                               
                                                                                             
                   3.   to raise the awareness among professional biologists of              
                        issues, concerns, and opportunities regarding ethnic                 
                        minorities in biology.
