Abstract    :
                   This award supports a fundamental set of experiments in                   
              paleoclimatic research.  Isotopic paleodendroclimatology is                    
              founded on the assumption that wood cellulose hydrogen and oxygen              
              isotope ratios co-vary in a one-to-one fashion with those of the               
              water available to a tree.  Qualitative and quantitative                       
              interpretations of wood cellulose isotope ratios involve the                   
              further assumption that post-photosynthetic processes do not                   
              affect cellulose isotopic compositions, and predict that humidity              
              will influence wood cellulose D/H and 180/160 ratios.  Neither                 
              of the assumptions may be valid, and the prediction of a humidity              
              effect may be incorrect.  Experiments that will resolve these                  
              fundamental uncertainties are to be performed with potatoes,                   
              avocados, the aquatic plant Lemna gibba, and protoplasts cultured              
              from a variety of tree species of interest to isotope                          
              paleodendroclimatologists.
