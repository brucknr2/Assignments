Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will conduct research developing               
              a fundamental theory for distributed microstructure systems.                   
              These systems provide a particularly effective representation of               
              the intricate interface between the components of a composite                  
              medium.  The qualitative analysis of the solutions of such                     
              systems is of significant scientific interest in view of the wide              
              spread application of such systems to physical systems.                        
                   Reaction-diffusion equations are useful as mathematical                   
              models in many areas of engineering, chemistry, and physics.  By               
              better understanding the fundamental theory of nonstandard models              
              modelling flows, better numerical predictions of real single                   
              phase flow in fractured media will result.
