Abstract    :
                   The objective of this Small Grants for Exploratory Research               
              (SGER) project is to evaluate brainstorming as a concept generation            
              methodology in engineering design.  A personality instrument is                
              used to formulate groups and performance is measured by the number             
              of concepts generated.  Concept generation ability is tested with              
              a single problem providing the functional requirement and the                  
              constraints.  Statistical evaluation is to be conducted of the                 
              standardized change data between pre- and post-test scenarios.                 
                   This research has the potential to develop ways of verifying              
              design research in a manner that addresses human and technical                 
              aspects and also introduces some aspects of psychology and                     
              personality into the study of design.//
