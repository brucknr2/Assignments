Abstract    :
                   This award is for software capitalization of a set of software            
              tools being written to support the development of parallel programs            
              that are portable across a wide variety of commercially available              
              multiprocessors.  The tools support development of programs that               
              utilize both shared memory machines and distributed memory machines.           
              A prototype has been written that provides for process creation and            
              termination, shared memory operations such as simple locking and high-         
              level monitor operations, message passing via send/receive, and                
              logging for debugging.  The tools use shared memory operations                 
              internally whenever possible (even for message passing), and use the           
              Berkeley socket mechanism for communication when shared memory is not          
              available.  On machines that provide a local communication mechanism           
              (such as some mesh machines), the local mechanism is employed                  
              internally.  The tools provide several advantages over existing                
              systems that have similar functionality.
