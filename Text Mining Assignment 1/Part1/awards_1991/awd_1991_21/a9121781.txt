Abstract    :
              In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the                       
              Chemistry Division, Dr. Veronica Bierbaum of the University of                 
              Colorado will study the kinetics, mechanisms, and                              
              thermochemistry of gas phase ion-molecule reactions using                      
              tandem flowing afterglow-selected ion flow tube instruments.                   
              Topics for study include proton transfer in simple systems,                    
              isotope exchange in associative detachment reactions, solvation                
              and kinetic isotope effects in nucleophilic substitution                       
              reactions of hydrated ions, rate coefficient and product                       
              distribution measurments of reactions of atmospheric interest,                 
              and the determination of thermochemical data for halogen- and                  
              sulfur-containing compounds.                                                   
              %%%                                                                            
              The study of gas phase ion chemistry affords the opportunity to                
              obtain a fundamental understanding of species and processes                    
              which are naturally present primarily in solution, in solids,                  
              or in the upper atmosphere.  By studying reactions between                     
              ionic and neutral atoms or molecules without surrounding                       
              solvent or other neighboring species, the structure,                           
              reactivity, and thermodynamic properties of the ionic atoms or                 
              molecules can be determined.  Applications span a broad variety                
              of fields, from medical and analytical to environmental.
