Abstract    :
              State of the art molecular beam epitaxy techniques are used to                 
              synthesize new magnetic multilayer films.  Both metals and oxygen-             
              based materials are being prepared.  The basic issues to be                    
              addressed are:  the role of epitaxial strain in determining the                
              phase diagram of thin magnetic single crystals; the propagation of             
              magnetic order and excitations through selected multilayer systems;            
              coherent electronic structure, including interfacial and                       
              magnetotransport effects; and low-dimensional behavior in                      
              structural ordering and magnetism using surfaces and interfaces                
              with tailored periodicities.
