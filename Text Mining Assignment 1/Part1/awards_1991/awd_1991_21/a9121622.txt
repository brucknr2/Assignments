Abstract    :
              The purpose of this research is to develop a comprehensive                     
              assessment of the cost and effectiveness of competing greenhouse               
              gas policy initiatives applied to the electric power industry, an              
              industry already targeted as a primary participant in any                      
              solution to global warming.  Existing studies typically focus on               
              the aggregate U.S or global economies and have a demand-side                   
              orientation, evaluating how consumption patterns will change in                
              response to regulation-induced price changes.  In contrast, this               
              project implements an applied macroeconomic model of firm                      
              behavior to assess how electric utilities would respond to                     
              alternative policy initiatives.  The model will be used to                     
              compare and contrast the critical properties of various policy                 
              options such as a carbon-content tax on fuels, a tax on the                    
              carbon-equivalent content of any emitted greenhouse gas, a                     
              command reduction in emissions, and a command reduction with                   
              allowed trading.                                                               
                                                                                             
              The econometric model and micro data set designed for this                     
              project will generate the following information for each policy                
              imitative: the expected reductions in carbon dioxide, nitrous                  
              oxides, overall carbon-equivalent emissions, the marginal costs                
              of reducing these emissions, the resulting impact on prices of                 
              electricity, and the coincident effects on both sulfur dioxide                 
              and ash emissions.  This information can be used to rank                       
              competing policy tools in terms of relative costs and                          
              effectiveness.
