Abstract    :
                   Boston University intends to buy a Thinking Machines                      
              Corporation Connection Machine, Model CM-5 to enhance Boston                   
              University's massively parallel scientific computing                           
              environment.  This award is for the purchase of a 20                           
              Gigabyte CM-5 disk array unit.  The equipment will be used to                  
              support research in molecular dynamics simulation of                           
              freezing, simulation of neural networks, quantum chemistry                     
              calculations, high energy physics particle tracking                            
              simulations, plasma simulations and chaos in N-body systems.                   
                                                                                             
              Computationally-based research which requires high precision                   
              solutions of large systems of ordinary differential equations                  
              and /or large matrix systems, will be pursued on-site at                       
              Boston University in its enhanced massively parallel                           
              scientific computing environment.  Its acquisition of a                        
              Thinking Machines' CM-5 Machine, and from this award, a 20                     
              Gigabyte CM-5 disk array unit, will enable Boston University                   
              to support projects in molecular dynamics, neural networks,                    
              quantum chemistry, particle tracking and plasma simulation.
