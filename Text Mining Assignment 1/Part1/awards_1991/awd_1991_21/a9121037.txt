Abstract    :
                   This effort by the American Statistical Association is                    
              designed to improve the survey research activities of NSF and is               
              entitled "On-site Research to Advance the Quality of Science and               
              Technology Resources."                                                         
                   The goal of the program is to bridge the gap between the                  
              collection, analysis, and dissemination of high quality statistical            
              information on the national and international resources devoted to             
              science and engineering, and the users of the data in industry,                
              academia, and government. Benefits to the academic and social                  
              science research communities and NSF will accrue through                       
              formulation of new and innovative research topics, research                    
              results, and an improvement in the approach to assuring quality in             
              science and engineering data, including all areas related to                   
              post-survey analysis and validation, such as design of nonresponse             
              studies; analysis of response patterns in longitudinal surveys;                
              analysis of item nonresponse patterns; and validation improvement              
              and survey research.
