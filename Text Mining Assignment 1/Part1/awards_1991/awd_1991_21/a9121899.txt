Abstract    :
                This award is to purchase two Transputer networks, a force-                  
              controlled Zebra Zero robot and two Silicon Graphics Personal                  
              Iris workstations.  This is a collaborative research effort                    
              between the University of Illinois and Yale University in the                  
              areas of parallel numerical curve tracing and cell                             
              decomposition, planning force-closure grasps, trajectory                       
              planning for visual servo control, and model-based vision.                     
                                                                                             
              A Transputer network will be installed at the University of                    
              Illinois and at Yale University.  A Zero Zebra robot and a                     
              Silicon Graphics Person Iris workstation will also be                          
              acquired to support collaborative experimental work in                         
              parallel numerical curve tracing and cell decomposition,                       
              planning force-closure grasps, trajectory planning for visual                  
              servo control, and model-based vision.
