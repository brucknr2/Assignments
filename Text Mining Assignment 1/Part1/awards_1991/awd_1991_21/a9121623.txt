Abstract    :
                   This grant supports basic theoretical research in                         
              nuclear/particle astrophysics.  One part of the project will                   
              study the dynamics of a QCD phase transition in the context of                 
              the evolution of the early universe.  Particular attention                     
              will be paid to the heat and baryon transport and the                          
              evolution of the fluid velocity field, as these will influence                 
              the subsequent calculation of nuclear abundances.  A second                    
              part deals with the weak interaction physics required for                      
              understanding the lepton distributions produced by supernovae                  
              explosions.  The shock wave re-heating problem will be studied                 
              together with the effects of allowing conversion between                       
              different types of neutrinos.                                                  
                   The QCD quark-gluon plasma phase is a new form of matter                  
              predicted by our current theoretical understanding of the                      
              strong interaction.  It is conjectured to have existed at the                  
              earliest moments of the big-bang creation of the universe.                     
              Supernovae are the pressure cookers which produce the nuclear                  
              matter in the universe but their mechanisms are not fully                      
              understood.  The problem of neutrino conversion goes beyond                    
              the current theoretical framework for the weak interaction and                 
              is related to a critical gap in our understanding of neutrinos                 
              produced by the Sun.
