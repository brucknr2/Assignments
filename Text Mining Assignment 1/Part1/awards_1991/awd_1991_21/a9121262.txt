Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The pineal gland, a small organ connected to the eyes and located              
              near the center of the brain, produces a hormone that provides                 
              important timing information to the body.  The pineal gland                    
              accomplishes this timing function by releasing the hormone                     
              melatonin into the blood only during darkness.  Because of this,               
              daytime levels of melatonin in the blood are low while they are                
              high at night.   Due to these day/night changes in melatonin, every            
              organ in the body is given information, even though not connected              
              to the eyes, as to whether it is light or dark.  When day length               
              (and of course night length change), such as during the various                
              seasons of the year, the melatonin message from the pineal gland               
              also changes accordingly.  The biological mechanisms whereby the               
              pineal gland is able to release high melatonin levels for longer               
              periods during winter nights are unknown.  The purpose of this                 
              research is to define how this is accomplished.  The problem is,               
              does the brain "dictate" to the pineal gland how long it must                  
              produce melatonin or does the pineal gland determine its own fate              
              and regulate the duration of melatonin release.  The studies                   
              outlined will examine these questions.  The information garnered               
              will be applicable to a number of important biological problems,               
              e.g. seasonal reproduction in animals, seasonal variation in wool              
              growth and milk production, daily variations in work efficiency,               
              understanding "jet lag" and the ability of shift workers to adapt              
              to new schedules, as well as understanding conditions such as                  
              "winter depression".
