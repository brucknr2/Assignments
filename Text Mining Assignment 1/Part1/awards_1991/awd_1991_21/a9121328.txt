Abstract    :
              An investigation of the stability and reactivity of a variety                  
              of radical species generated from azo compounds will be                        
              conducted. Reaction mechanisms will be established by the use                  
              of a variety of techniques including electroanalytical methods,                
              laser flash photolysis, calorimetry, preparative and                           
              quantitative photochemistry, and ESR. The projects to be                       
              investigated will include: (1) assessment of the stability of                  
              azaallyl radicals and the factors which determine their                        
              recombination to yield dimers; (2) determination of the                        
              lifetimes of cyclic biradicals using a free radical clock; and                 
              (3) elucidation of the detained mechanism of the oxidation of                  
              azoalkanes by stable cation radical salts. The project will                    
              involve both the synthesis of a variety of novel azo compouunds                
              as well as precise calculations of rate processes and the                      
              determination of the identity of reactive intermediates.                       
              %%%                                                                            
              This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the                      
              continuing work of Professor Paul S. Engel at Rice University.                 
              These studies will be center around the reactions and inherent                 
              stabilities of radical species which are generated upon                        
              exposure of certain chemical compounds to either heat or light.                
              In order to ascertain the nature of these radical species,                     
              which exist for only a few billionths of a second, a variety of                
              sophisticated methods will be utilized. By understanding the                   
              stability of these intermediate compounds, it will be possible                 
              to devise similar systems that will be more efficient and                      
              result in faster reactions. This is particularly important                     
              since the base compounds to be investigated represent a class                  
              of chemical substances which have found widespread use in a                    
              variety of industrial applications involving the processing of                 
              plastics and foams.
