Abstract    :
              This project, funded by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organo-                
              metallic Chemistry Program, deals with the mechanistic based                   
              development of catalysts for alkane carbonylation and the                      
              reverse process, aldehyde decarbonylation.  Several approaches                 
              to the development of catalytic systems will be studied                        
              including novel radical-based photochemical and thermal                        
              systems, photochemically activated trans-carbonylchloro-                       
              bis(trimethylphosphine)rhodium(I), and other thermally                         
              activated compounds of rhodium and ruthenium.  Both experi-                    
              mental and theoretical approaches to catalyst design will be                   
              utilized.

              Selective functionalization of hydrocarbons under mild                         
              conditions remains as one of the most significant, but elusive,                
              goals of modern chemistry.  The technological implications of                  
              selective, and energy-efficient reactions of hydrocarbons are                  
              enormous.  Recent discoveries by organo- metallic chemists have                
              indicated that certain transition metal complexes will react                   
              with hydrocarbons under mild conditions.  This project will                    
              attempt to extend these earlier studies to generate catalytic                  
              cycles in which metallated hydrocarbons react with carbon                      
              monoxide to produce aldehydes, which can serve as precursors to                
              a wide variety of other types of compounds.
