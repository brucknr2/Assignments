Abstract    :
                   DARPA, NSF, NASA, and DoE all have requirements to connect                
              their CONUS grantees and contractors with a computer network to                
              colleagues and facilities in the United Kingdom.  In the past,                 
              these needs have been met by each Agency individually, through                 
              individual procurements of low-speed (9600 to 56,000 baud),                    
              typically satellite, circuits between networks at affected sites on            
              either side of the Atlantic.                                                   
                   Substantial economies of scale exist in the telecommunications            
              industry.  Through discussions leading to mutual agreements, the               
              agencies are able to meet all their needs for US-UK computer                   
              connectivity by sharing a single fractional-T1 (512 kb/s)                      
              fiber-optic circuit.  DARPA have agreed to act as the agent for                
              procuring the circuit; the purpose of this project is to compensate            
              DARPA for NSF's agreed-to share of the cost.
