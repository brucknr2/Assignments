Abstract    :
                   Research in theoretical elementary particle physics will                  
              include studies of high energy elementary particle and nuclear                 
              reactions, based on quantum chromodynamics (QCD).  There will                  
              also be applications of techniques borrowed from string theory                 
              to QCD, studies of the nonconservation of the nucleon number                   
              of physical systems, and a variety of analyses in string                       
              theory.  String theory is a promising candidate for a theory                   
              of all the forces of nature, including gravity, and QCD is an                  
              increasingly-verified theory of the strong nuclear force.                      
              Improved knowledge of the nature and consequences of string                    
              theory and QCD - the goal of this project - is clearly                         
              important.
