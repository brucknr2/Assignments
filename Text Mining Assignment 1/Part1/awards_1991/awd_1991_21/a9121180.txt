Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will support the participation of nine U.S. scientists              
              in a joint workshop in the "Biology and Molecular Biology of                   
              Extreme Thermophiles" to be held at the University of Waikato in               
              Hamilton, New Zealand in May 1992.  The existance of extreme                   
              thermophiles, microorganisms which live and grow at temperatures.              
              above 70oC, challenges the understanding of the limitations of                 
              biological systems.  As sources of thermostable enzymes these                  
              microorganisms are very important economically as natural                      
              resources.  This workshop will allow both academic and industry-               
              based scientists from both New Zealand and the U.S. to present                 
              and discuss the results of their most recent research.  The                    
              meeting is being co-organized by Dr. John N. Reeve from Ohio                   
              State University and Dr. Peter L. Bergquist from the University                
              of Auckland.                                                                   
                                                                                             
              The formal presentations will be grouped into sessions focussed                
              on the environment and ecology, enzymology and physiology,                     
              molecular biology and commercial application of extreme                        
              thermophiles.  Emphasis will be placed on interactions and,                    
              hopefully, future collaborations between researchers studying the              
              natural habitats and in situ microbiology of geothermal areas.                 
              There will be four days of presentations and group discussions                 
              and a field-trip to the Rotorua Geothermal Region located 80 km                
              from Hamilton.
