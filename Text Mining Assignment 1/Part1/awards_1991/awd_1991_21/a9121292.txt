Abstract    :
              The objective of this research project is to                                   
              study the effects of differential excitations                                  
              along the base of a dam, caused by spatially                                   
              varying earthquake ground motion.  The                                         
              standard procedure is to assume that all points                                
              at the base of the dam simultaneously                                          
              experience the same earthquake-induced                                         
              ground motion - that is, that the dam is shaken                                
              by the motion of a rigid plate on which it rests.                              
              In contrast, this study accounts for phase delay                               
              and incoherence effects of the base excitations                                
              arising from the propagation and scattering of                                 
              seismic waves.                                                                 
                                                                                             
              Appropriate ground motion data are now                                         
              available from the analysis and stochastic                                     
              modeling of recent accelerograph recordings on                                 
              and near earth dams.  The research program                                     
              involves:                                                                      
                                                                                             
              1) The selection of a suitable ground motion                                   
              model from these data;                                                         
                                                                                             
              2) A linear random vibration analysis of a                                     
              three-dimensional earth dam model to study                                     
              the effects of spatially varying ground motions;                               
                                                                                             
              3) The development of approximate excitation                                   
              specifications that yield reasonable responses                                 
              when the dam is analyzed using a two-                                          
              dimensional model;                                                             
                                                                                             
              4) A preliminary assessment of topographical                                   
              effects;                                                                       
                                                                                             
              5) Investigation of the non-linear response                                    
              using the method of equivalent linearization,                                  
              with verification by Monte Carlo simulation.                                   
                                                                                             
              The results from this research are relevant to                                 
              safety evaluations of existing earth dams, as                                  
              well as to the design of new earth dams.
