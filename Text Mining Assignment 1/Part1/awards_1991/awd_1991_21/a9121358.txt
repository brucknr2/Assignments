Abstract    :
                   One of the most urgent questions in biological oceanography               
              at present is that of the fate of small phototrophs in pelagic                 
              food webs.  The prevailing concept, based on both theoretical                  
              considerations as well as laboratory and field data, is that                   
              phagotrophic protists are the dominant predators of < 5 um sized               
              cells, and as well may consume a significant portion of the                    
              biomass production of larger phytoplankton.  Most previous                     
              studies of protistan herbivory have involved either laboratory                 
              experiments with single species, primarily ciliates, or                        
              estimation of total microzooplankton grazing pressure on natural               
              phytoplankton assemblages. A more complete picture of the                      
              magnitude and details of the component parts of this link in                   
              pelagic food webs in needed, especially with respect to the role               
              of phagotrophic flagellates.  Dr. Shapiro and collaborators will               
              investigate herbivory by pelagic flagellates and ciliates in the               
              natural planktonic assemblages of Oregon coastal waters.                       
              Questions addressed will include: 1) Do phagotrophic protists                  
              have a greater grazing impact on <5 um sized phytoplankton than                
              on cells > 5 um? 2) What is the relative grazing impact of                     
              flagellates versus ciliates on phytoplankton? 3) Do rates of                   
              protistan herbivory show consistent day/night differences? 4) Do               
              thresholds of prey density exist? 5) Does predation affect the                 
              cell division rates of phytoplankton? 6) Do phagotrophic protists              
              show selective feeding among various phytoplankton taxa in situ?
