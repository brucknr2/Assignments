Abstract    :
              Large meteorite impact craters on the Earth are rare at best, and              
              only Tunguska in Siberia is known to be less than 10,000 years                 
              old.  However, there is strong evidence that a large meteorite                 
              (est. over 100 meters in diameter) struck in South America                     
              (Argentina) in the very recent past, possibly within the last                  
              2000 years.  At present this crater is virtually unknown to both               
              the public and the scientific community but knowledge of it's                  
              existence is bound to spread rapidly.  If this impact was caused               
              by a bolide bigger than Tunguska and the crater is better                      
              preserved than Meteor Crater, the scientific implications will be              
              startling.  This award will enable the PI to visit the site this               
              Fall where he and his local collaborators plan to conduct field                
              investigations, collect samples and do some preliminary analysis.
