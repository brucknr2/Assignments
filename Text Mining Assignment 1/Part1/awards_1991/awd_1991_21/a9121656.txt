Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Vital functions of the body are controlled by complex mechanisms               
              of the brainstem, which involve both hormones and                              
              neurotransmitter substances. The research to be performed by Dr.               
              Myers as a result of this award will deal with processes                       
              responsible for hunger, the act of feeding, the condition of                   
              satiety, experimental anorexia, the regulation of body                         
              temperature, hyperthermia and hypothermia. Special emphasis will               
              be placed on the interaction between mechanisms of hunger and of               
              temperature regulation. In specific experiments, the function of               
              a newly discovered protein factor called macrophage inflammatory               
              protein 1 (MIP-1 ) will be studied. This substance is a potent                 
              endogenous factor which has been directly implicated in the                    
              regulation of hunger and temperature at the level of                           
              hypothalamus. The studies will focus on brain sensitivity to MIP-              
              1 in terms of changes in temperature anf feeding, and the                      
              interaction of MIP-1 with other neurotransmitters that are known               
              to be involved in physiological regulation of these                            
              functions.This research will contribute fundamental scientific                 
              information about how hormones and transmitters in the brain can               
              modulate life-sustaining regulatory functions.
