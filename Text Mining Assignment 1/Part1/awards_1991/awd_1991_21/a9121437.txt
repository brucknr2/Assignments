Abstract    :
                   This award will support research on heat equation                         
              asymptotics with generalized boundary conditions. The boundary                 
              conditions will be of Atiyah, Patodi, and Singer type. The                     
              research will include a study of the Dolbeault complex for a                   
              Hermitian matrix where the structures are not product near the                 
              boundary and the eta invariant of a manifold with boundary.                    
                   The research supported by this award involves aspects of                  
              global analysis and spectral geometry. Global analysis attempts                
              to relate topological properties of a space with analytic                      
              properties. Spectral geometry studies the relationship between                 
              the geometry of a space and invariants of a differential operator              
              defined on the space.
