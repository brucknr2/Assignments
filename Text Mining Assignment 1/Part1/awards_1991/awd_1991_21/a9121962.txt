Abstract    :
                   This research is intended to evaluate, analyze and design a               
              completely novel approach to configuring Computer Numeric Control              
              (CNC) metal-cutting machine tools.  Traditional CNC machines are               
              primarily configured as a set of mutually perpendicular linear axes            
              and cutting tool paths are generated by the interpolation of these             
              linear axes, to cut the variety of shapes hat have to be                       
              manufactured.  In this approach the machine tool consists of only              
              rotary axes and all the variety of tool paths that need to be                  
              generated will result from their interpolation.  The benefits of               
              configuring the machine in this manner are well established but                
              complex and significant control issues need to be evaluated and                
              addressed in order to establish the feasibility of this approach.              
                   The success of this program, which is being jointly funded by             
              a quasi-industry organization, could lead to minor revolution in               
              the way conventional machine tools are configured and potentially              
              provide the domestic industry an opportunity to exploit.
