Abstract    :
              This dissertation research project studies the social                          
              interactions within and between the biomedical research and                    
              animal rights communities.  The research examines the process by               
                                                                                             
              which participants form opinions about what constitutes ethical                
              research with animals and the factors that lead to escalation and              
                                                                                             
              deescalation of conflicts.  The analysis draws on three years of               
                                                                                             
              observations at organization meetings, symposia and protests of                
              animal rights activists and biomedical researchers in two                      
              communities in a Southern state of the United States.  These data              
                                                                                             
              are supplemented with 50 interviews of participants, a review of               
                                                                                             
              media coverage, and analysis of literature developed and                       
              distributed by the animal rights and biomedical research                       
              community.  This grant will enable the researcher to extend his                
              observations to and collect data in a second community.  Results               
                                                                                             
              will provide a theoretical and practical contribution to                       
              understanding social movements and the emergence of ethical                    
              conflicts involving science and technology.
