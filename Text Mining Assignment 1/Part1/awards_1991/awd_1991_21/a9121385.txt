Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Most vertebrate brains suffer irreversible damage when deprived of             
              oxygen for more than a few minutes.  As a result little is known               
              of brain anaerobic and hypoxic processes.  Some reptilian brains               
              are unique in their ability to survive under totally anaerobic                 
              conditions for many hours.  Previous studies in Dr. Lutz's                     
              laboratory have shown that the anaerobic brain greatly reduces its             
              energy expenditure to match a corresponding reduction in energy                
              availability.  The mechanisms by which this down regulation in                 
              brain energy requirements are achieved is of considerable interest             
              and will be investigated in the present study.  Dr. Lutz's                     
              hypothesis is that adenosine release plays a key role in mediating             
              the crucial transition between the normal aerobic state and the                
              metabolically depressed anoxic state.  These studies are proposed              
              to test this hypothesis which will include investigating the                   
              physiological/electrophysiological effects of the pharmacological              
              manipulation of adenosine receptors.  The knowledge gained will                
              provide insights not only into an extraordinary neuronal adaptation            
              to but also into the processes underlying the harmful changes that             
              occur during oxygen lack in vertebrate brain in general, including             
              that of the mammal, particularly those associated with anoxic                  
              damage.***//
