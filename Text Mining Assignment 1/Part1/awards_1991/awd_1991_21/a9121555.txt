Abstract    :
                   The overall thrust of the research is to provide a                        
              nonparmetric alternative to current parametric approaches used in              
              response surface methodology.  The nonparametric methodology is                
              based on kernel estimators.  A test will be developed for the                  
              validity of the general additive model against a nonparametric                 
              alternative.  In the case of a semiparametric model which models               
              which models the deterministic part of the relationship between a              
              response variable and several covariates, some covariates will be              
              included in a parametric portion and the remaining covariates in               
              a nonparametric portion.  Then a test will be developed for the                
              validity of the postulated semiparametric model against a                      
              nonparametric alternative.  In choosing bandwidths for kernel                  
              estimates of a regression function, an analysis and method for                 
              choosing the optimal number of points to leave out of a cross                  
              validation type procedure will be developed assuming a pilot                   
              estimate of the unknown regression function is given.
