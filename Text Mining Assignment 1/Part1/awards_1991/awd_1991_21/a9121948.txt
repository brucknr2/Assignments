Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal is a renewal proposal to a prior NSF grant,                      
              DMR-8819186.  It plans to perform three major tasks.  One is the               
              measurement of preferred crystalline orientation (texture)                     
              resulting from the deformation of polycrystalline structural                   
              ceramics, such as Al2O3, ZrO2, and alkali halides.  Related work               
              involves Si3N4, and ceramic matrix composites.  Second task is to              
              use polycrystal deformation mechanisms to explain the textures.                
              The third task is to demonstrate the anisotropic properties as the             
              results of the texture.                                                        
              %%%%                                                                           
              This proposed research is a continuation of the PI's efforts in                
              establishing quantitative description of textures in ceramic                   
              materials.  It will provide information about the mechanical                   
              deformation of polycrystalline ceramic materials.
