Abstract    :
              The 1975 Metric Conversion Act, as amended by the Omnibus Trade and            
              Competitiveness Act of 1988, requires that all Federal agencies                
              conduct their business using the metric system of measurement by               
              September 1992, with the intent of increasing the nation's                     
              competitiveness in the world marketplace and reducing the cost of              
              the government's own operations.                                               
                                                                                             
              Pursuant to this Act, the National Institute of Building Sciences              
              is providing technical and administrative support to the                       
              Construction Subcommittee of the Metric Operating Committee of the             
              U.S. Interagency Council on Metric Policy in its efforts to                    
              implement the metric system of measurement in Federal construction.            
                                                                                             
              PI proposed to promote and monitor the metric conversion of design             
              and construction practices in the U.S., to disseminate information,            
              to develop awareness program and to support U.S. activities in                 
              international standards.
