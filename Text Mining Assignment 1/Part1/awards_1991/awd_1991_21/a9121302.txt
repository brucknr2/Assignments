Abstract    :
              The direct transfer of excitation energy among localized states via            
              tunneling (hopping) in semiconductors is to be investigated.  This             
              process has often been neglected in the past.  A study of the                  
              extent and of the mechanisms governing this transfer related to                
              donor-acceptor pairs (DAPs) are necessary for a full understanding             
              of luminescence phenomena.  The proper material parameters for the             
              luminescence processes will be re-evaluated using samples which                
              have negligible transfer or where the correction factors are known.            
              The work will center on Zinc-Selenium, for which a large number of             
              samples are available.  The study will include a detailed                      
              examination of time decay, and of spectral and intensity evolution             
              as a function of excitation intensity and wavelength, temperature,             
              and impurity concentration.
