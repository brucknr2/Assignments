Abstract    :
              An examination of the history of the development of quantum                    
              mechanics in the early part of the present century shows the                   
              essential influence both of factors usually taken to be "internal"             
              to science (such as logical consistency, empirical adequacy,                   
              fertility and the like) and of "external" ones (such as                        
              professional rivalries and prior metaphysical commitments of some              
              of the major scientists).  Neither class of factors alone can                  
              explain why the "Copenhagen" interpretation of quantum mechanics,              
              with its ineliminable indeterminism at the level of microprocesses,            
              was chosen by the consensus of the scientific community to the                 
              virtual exclusion of an equally empirically adequate and fertile               
              causal version of quantum mechanics in which one has the                       
              deterministic, continuous and picturable evolution of microsystems             
              in a space-time background.  Professor Cushing argues that there               
              exists a possible, and in fact plausible, temporal reordering of               
              certain highly contingent events in the actual historical record               
              that could have resulted in the acceptance of a deterministic,                 
              causal quantum theory to the exclusion of the present "Copenhagen"             
              orthodoxy of inherent indeterminism.  In this research project,                
              Professor Cushing is exploring the ramifications of the existence              
              of a viable rival to the accepted position in science and the                  
              failure of science to explore this alternative.  He argues that                
              this raises practical as opposed to just in-principle problems of              
              the underdetermination of accepted scientific theories by an                   
              empirical basis and questions of the reliability of the knowledge              
              with which science provides.
