Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The "Golden-Gopher", a mid-infrared, 2-dimensional imaging                     
              instrument was completed in 1989.  The focal plane uses a 20X64                
              element As:Si array manufactured by Aerojet Electronic Systems                 
              Division with a plate scale of 0.83 arcsec/pixel.  The Golden-                 
              Gopher currently achieves SNR = 1 at a flux density of 3 mJy/pixel             
              in 30 minutes of on-source integration at 8.5 micrometer with a 1              
              micrometer bandwidth.  The optical design includes a spectroscopic             
              option at R=100 by rotating a plane mirror which has a grating                 
              back-to-back.  Problems with the rotation bearing mechanism have               
              prevented observations in the spectroscopic mode.  In the coming               
              year the Golden-Gopher will be modified to enable routine                      
              spectroscopic observations, e.g. long slit spectra of the silicate             
              feature of galactic nuclei and the 8.7 and 11.3 micrometer "PAH"               
              bands as well as the ?Ar III!, ?S IV) and ?Ne II! lines.  Imaging              
              spectroscopic observations are to be made of a wide range of                   
              galaxies, including systems from the IRAS bright galaxy sample.                
              These data will give information on the morphology of the nuclear              
              region and the physical extent of the emitting dust and ionized                
              gas.  Such measurements will allow new limits to be placed on the              
              proportion of flux due to unresolved active nuclei as opposed to               
              regions of star formation.
