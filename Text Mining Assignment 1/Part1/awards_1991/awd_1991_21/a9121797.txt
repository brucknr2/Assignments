Abstract    :
                   This award is to purchase a Salisbury dextrous robot                      
              hand and a VPL Dataglove to support research on assembly                       
              systems.  The addition of the robot hand to Carnegie Mellon's                  
              existing PUMA arm will form a powerful testbed for research                    
              requiring flexible assembly operations.  The research                          
              projects will be examining issues surrounding the kind of                      
              information that should be collected from vision, the kind of                  
              suitable description methods, and the kind of assembly                         
              operations that can be achieved by an assembly system.                         
                                                                                             
              In robotic assembly systems, a dextrous hand is essential to                   
              extend the research to a wider range or realistic assemblies.                  
              An example of such a research project is how to represent a                    
              human hand, how to recognize a hand configuration from                         
              observation, and how to map such a configuration to a robot                    
              hand configuration.  Other projects in robotic assembly                        
              systems involve evaluating at the design stage, how easily                     
              products can be assembled, assembly planning and execution,                    
              and establishing a design methodology for computer vision                      
              systems with respect to hand-eye systems.
