Abstract    :
              Recently developed epitaxial growth techniques are used to                     
              fabricate new magnetic semiconductor heterostructures based on                 
              zinc-blend phases of the mangenese chalcogenides MnTe and MnSe, and            
              related alloys containing cadmium and zinc.  The magnetic dilution,            
              and the number of epilayers present.  The magnetic interactions                
              lead to new magnetic structures which are being investigated by                
              neutron diffraction, the primary experimental tool of this project.            
              The effects of strain on magnetic phase diagrams will be studied               
              systematically in order to determine the regions of stability of               
              new phases of antiferromagnetic heterostructures.  The                         
              magnetostriction in the materials is of potential technological                
              significance.
