Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The neuroendocrine mechanisms that regulate the control of                     
              feeding is a fundamentally important problem that is not well                  
              understood.  It is known that control of food consumption depends              
              on complex interactions between several types of neurochemicals,               
              including neuropeptides and steroidal hormones.  Based on                      
              extensive neurobiological data, Dr. Deviche hypothesizes that                  
              opioids interact with androgens within specific brain cells of                 
              the hypothalamus, an important neural structure for regulatory                 
              behaviors.  To test this theory, he will use a combination of                  
              neuroanatomical, biochemical and behavioral approaches.                        
              Experiments will identify the specific hypothalamic nuclei that                
              opioid peptides act to influence feeding, and where these                      
              peptides interact with respect to testosterone, the major                      
              testicular androgen.  Moreover, the unique environment at the                  
              University of Alaska enables Dr. Deviche to utilize a seasonally               
              breeding, migratory avian species that undergo extreme seasonal                
              changes in testosterone as his model.  He will establish the                   
              relationship between density of CNS opioid receptors and                       
              variations within plasma concentrations of this androgen.  It is               
              likely that these data could ultimately have significance for our              
              understanding of human eating disorders.  For example, anorexia                
              nervosa is a life-threatening eating disorder for which there is               
              some evidence for opioid and endocrine dysfunctions.
