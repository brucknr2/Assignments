Abstract    :
                   This award is for the purchase of 64 TMS320C40 chips in                   
              order to build an asynchronous six-dimensional hypercube-                      
              based system to serve as a high-speed low-cost simulator of                    
              large neural networks.  The system will be used to                             
              investigate neural network architectures and learning laws in                  
              applications where a great number of interconnection weights                   
              is necessary.  Such applications include computer network                      
              congestion management, flow control and adaptive routing, and                  
              pattern recognition.                                                           
                                                                                             
              New Jersey Institute of Technology is proposing a high-speed,                  
              low-cost solution to the tasks of designing and evaluating                     
              neural network architectures and learning protocols.  They                     
              will be building an asynchronous six-dimensional hypercube-                    
              based system that supports efficiently both local and global                   
              communications, has a modest number of high-power processors,                  
              but is of low overall system cost.//
