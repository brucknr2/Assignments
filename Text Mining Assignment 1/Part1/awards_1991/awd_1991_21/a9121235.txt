Abstract    :
                   One factor thought to play an important role in sex ratio                 
              evolution is mating pattern.  In the 1930s, R. A. Fisher                       
              predicted that a 1:1 ratio would evolve in species with random                 
              mating.  Later, W. D. Hamilton predicted that biased sex ratios                
              would evolve in populations with non-random mating.  While sex                 
              ratios correlate with mating patterns across many species, these               
              predictions have not been tested directly.  This can be done by                
              allowing sex ratios to evolve, via natural selections, in                      
              experimental populations with differing mating patterns.  The                  
              goals of the proposed research are (1) to follow the process of                
              sex ratio evolution in genetically variable populations with                   
              random mating, (2) to determine the behavioral and  genetic                    
              mechanisms by which sex ratios evolve in these populations, and                
              (3) to assess the genetic correlations among facultative sex                   
              ratio responses to multiple environments.  For the experiments,                
              we will use a wasp species in which females exhibit complex                    
              behavioral control over the sex ratio among their offspring.                   
              These experiments represent a novel approach to the study of sex               
              ratio and should provide a rich source of new insights into sex                
              ratio evolution in a species with complex, facultative, variation              
              in sex ratio behavior.
