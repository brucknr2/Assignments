Abstract    :
              The Combustion Institute holds biennial international meetings                 
              for presentation of the latest experimental and theoretical                    
              research results across the spectrum of Combustion Science and                 
              Engineering.  The 1992 meeting will be held in July, 1992 in                   
              Sydney, Australia.  It is expected to draw approximately 1200                  
              participants and results in roughly 250 carefully screened                     
              invited review and original papers.  Funds are being supplied                  
              to help offset the costs of publishing the bound meeting                       
              proceedings.
