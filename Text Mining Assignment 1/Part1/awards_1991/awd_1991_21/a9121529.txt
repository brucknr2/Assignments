Abstract    :
                   This is a project to study shock wave and other                           
              discontinuous solutions of the equations that govern the flow of               
              compressible fluids. For example, there are still many unanswered              
              questions regarding the role that dissipative mechanisms play in               
              the interaction of two or more shock waves and the long-time                   
              stability of such waves.  The principal investigator will use                  
              analytic and asymptotic tools to answer these questions and                    
              related ones.  In addition to the usual equations of fluid                     
              dynamics  the principal investigator will study systems of                     
              equations in magneto-hydrodynamics, the kinetic theory of gases,               
              and the theory of shallow water waves.                                         
                   Dissipative forces like friction can be small in certain                  
              problems in fluid dynamics, but their effect cannot be neglected.              
              For example, the viscosity (internal friction) of a gas is very                
              small and yet it affects the large-scale behavior of objects that              
              move through the gas.  The principal investigator will study how               
              such small dissipative mechanisms can influence the formation and              
              propagation of shock waves in gases.  A shock wave is something                
              like a sonic boom, and it is an important feature of flows at                  
              high speeds.
