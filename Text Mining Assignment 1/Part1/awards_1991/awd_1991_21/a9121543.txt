Abstract    :
                   This Special Minority Award provides a year of support                    
              for Mr. Michael McNeil, who is beginning graduate studies at                   
              the University of California, Santa Cruz.  The award will                      
              allow the incumbent to finish his course work expeditiously                    
              and reach the research participation phase of his studies                      
              sooner.  This award is an integral part of the strategy of the                 
              National Science Foundation to strengthen and increase                         
              minority participation in the field of physics.
