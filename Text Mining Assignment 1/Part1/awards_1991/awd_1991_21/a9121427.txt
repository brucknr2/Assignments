Abstract    :
                   This grant will support a two year program of research                    
              involving a search for electrically charged, massive particles                 
              thought to make up a significant part of the mass of the                       
              universe.  Such "charged dark matter" is made up of particles                  
              called CHAMPS, and is thought to exist in order to explain                     
              various cosmological phenomena.  The existence of dark matter                  
              has never been established, but searches for it form an                        
              interesting component of current research in particle physics.                 
              The proponent hopes to participate in theoretical studies of                   
              the interactions of CHAMPS with the atmosphere of Earth as                     
              well as that in space, and to conduct an experiment using an                   
              apparatus mounted on a balloon to be launched later in 1992.
