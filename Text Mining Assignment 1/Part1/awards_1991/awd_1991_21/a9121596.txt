Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              In this project, the P.I.'s will continue numerical and                        
              analytical studies of the propagation and evolution of strong                  
              economic vortices in the presence of horizontal and vertical                   
              shears, explore mixing by mesoscale vortices and strong eddies,                
              and examine the influence of vertical mixing driven by surface                 
              heat fluxes on oceanic eddies.
