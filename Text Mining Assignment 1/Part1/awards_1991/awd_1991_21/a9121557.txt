Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Mixed convection in porous channels has been numerically                       
              simulated to investigate the inverse relation between Nusselt                  
              number and Rayleigh number when the forced flow opposes the                    
              buoyancy.  The viscous term has been found to influence the                    
              results to a much greater degree than the inertial term.                       
              Support is being provided to review mixed flow in porous flows                 
              in general, and these results in particular, at the                            
              International Center for Heat and Mass Transfer in Dubrovnik,                  
              Yugoslavia.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              The seminar to be presented is aimed at documenving recent                     
              advances in the fundamentals of mixed convection in porous                     
              media and their applications.  The intent is to provide the                    
              heat transfer community with a reference work that will                        
              complement the Proceedings of the 1990 NATO Advanced Study                     
              Institute held in Izmir.
