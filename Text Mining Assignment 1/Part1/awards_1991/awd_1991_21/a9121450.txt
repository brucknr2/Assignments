Abstract    :
                   The goal of thei exploratory research is to assess the                    
              potential for the development of a well documented quality                     
              controlled global data set of subsurface temperatures and                      
              ancillary data relevant to the analysis of recent climate change.              
              Subsurface temperatures stored worldwide in the rocks ofthe                    
              Earth's continental crust record several centureies of surface                 
              temperature excursions, but great care must be taken to seperate               
              local anthropogenic effects such as urbanization, deforestation                
              and wetland destruction, and microclimatic effects associated                  
              with topography and vegetation patterns, from true regional                    
              climatological changes.  The feasibility of assembling a global                
              data set will be determined in discussions with members of the                 
              international geothermal community the through examination of                  
              unpublished data archives.                                                     
                   This research is important because it has the potential to                
              full critical gaps in long-term terrestrial surface temperature                
              records, and hence help resolve issues of climate change                       
              detections.
