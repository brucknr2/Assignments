Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Materials Research Laboratory (MRL) at Cornell University                  
              supports interactive and interdisciplinary research in four major              
              thrust areas.  It provides a central focus for interdisciplinary               
              materials research at Cornell.                                                 
                                                                                             
              Researchers in the polymers and polymer composites thrust are                  
              studying polymer interfaces and thin films, nanoscale polymer                  
              composites, and the dynamics of liquid crystalline polymers.  The              
              quantum phenomena thrust addresses the influence of quantum effects            
              on electron transport in mesoscale systems, phase transitions, and             
              fundamental excitations in condensed matter; researchers in this               
              area also share expertise in low temperature experimental                      
              techniques.  The surface structure and dynamics of a variety of                
              materials are studied in the surfaces and interfaces thrust.  A new            
              thrust on theory and modelling of materials represents a concerted             
              attempt to exploit major new computing resources to advance                    
              materials research in the MRL and beyond.                                      
                                                                                             
              The MRL also supports the development, operation and maintenance of            
              major central facilities for materials research.  It provides seed             
              funding for exploratory research, supports a program to enhance the            
              participation of minorities in materials research, fosters research            
              participation by undergraduates, and administers an active                     
              industrial outreach program.  The MRL currently supports the                   
              research activities of about 53 faculty members, 6 postdoctoral                
              research associates, 39 graduate students, 17 undergraduates and 12            
              technical and scientific staff members: the MRL central facilities             
              also support a substantial amount of research that is funded                   
              directly from other sources.  The Cornell MRL is directed by                   
              Professor John Silcox.
