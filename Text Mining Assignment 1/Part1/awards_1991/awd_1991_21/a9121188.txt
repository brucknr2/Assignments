Abstract    :
              In accordance with the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between NSF               
              and NASA signed in January 1991, the framework for collaboration               
              between NASA and NSF was established to jointly develop projects               
              on antarctic activities that are applicable to space research and              
              exploration.                                                                   
                                                                                             
              On July 3, 1991 the Antarctic Space Analog Program Committee                   
              reviewed several proposed projects and selected two for funding as             
              demonstration projects for antarctic space analog program                      
              demonstration project during the 1992-93 austral summer.                       
                                                                                             
              A summary of the statement of work for those two projects follow               
              this abstract.                                                                 
                                                                                             
              A total of $150,000 is recommended for FY 91 funding by NSF/DPP.               
              This will be matched by $100,000 from NASA.  FY 92 funding will                
              also be provided by the two agencies.
