Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Suspensions of charge-stabilized polymer spheres are exploited to              
              study the basic equilibrium and non-equilibrium properties of                  
              systems of strongly interacting spherical particles.                           
                                                                                             
              Such systems are uniquely suited for testing classical statistical             
              physics.
