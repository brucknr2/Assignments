Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The primary goal of this project is to determine how reliably                  
              mtDNA can be used to reconstruct the evolutionary history of                   
              higher primates (monkeys, apes and humans).  The use of mtDNA to               
              study higher primate evolution rests on three critical                         
              assumptions: (1) that we know the rate at which the mtDNA of two               
              species diverge from one another; (2) that this rate is constant               
              over time and across different groups of species; and (3) that                 
              within a species, individuals have mtDNA that is more or less the              
              same.  The PI has begun to test these assumptions on a number of               
              Asian macaque monkey species and has found (1) large mtDNA                     
              differences between members of the same species, (2) rates of                  
              mtDNA divergence that vastly exceed the accepted rate of change,               
              and (3) divergence rates that vary among populations or species.               
              These findings suggest serious problems with the use of mtDNA to               
              reconstruct evolutionary relationships and date evolutionary                   
              events.                                                                        
                                                                                             
              Macaque monkey females never leave the group they are born in;                 
              the results may be related to this sedentary behavior.                         
              Therefore, the extent to which the problems already identified                 
              will be found in apes and humans is unclear.  The PI proposes to               
              investigate this by extending research to other macaque species                
              and by performing similar sets of tests on the Asian leaf                      
              monkeys, whose females do not necessarily stay in their original               
              group.  This research will provide the first comprehensive                     
              assessment of the dynamics of mtDNA evolution in the higher                    
              primates.  Such information will ultimately lead to a better                   
              understanding of the evolutionary history of humans and their                  
              closest relatives.
