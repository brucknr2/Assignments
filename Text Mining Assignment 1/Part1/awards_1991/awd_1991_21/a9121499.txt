Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This is a study of the decline in fertility in the American               
              South between 1910 and 1940.  Most studies of the transition from              
              high to low fertility has focused on the national pattern.  There              
              were, however, striking regional variations in the timing and                  
              pace of the fertility decline.  This study will pay special                    
              attention to the sharp decline in childbearing in rural black                  
              families which took place between 1910 and 1940.  Public Use                   
              Samples from the 1910 and the 1940 Census will be used.  These                 
              data will be combined with data on the local area in which the                 
              household lives.                                                               
                   This study will provide a significant contribution to the                 
              large literature on the fertility transition by focusing on a                  
              part of American society which has not been much studied earlier.              
              The study will contribute to our understanding of why couples                  
              decided to have fewer children, and it will in particular shed                 
              light on the experiences of rural black families during the early              
              part of the twentieth century.
