Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project contributes supplemental funds to aid the                         
              dissertation research of a student of cultural anthropology.  The              
              project studies the meanings of drinking, drunkenness and                      
              sobriety among different groups of urban American Indians in                   
              Minneapolis.  Through analysis of conversational and narrative                 
              discourse the student investigates the role of drinking in urban               
              Indian life, and proposes to examine the differences between                   
              situational and cultural factors affecting the meaning of                      
              drinking to urban Indians.  Methods include sampling different                 
              levels of drinkers (binge, moderate, abstinent), tribes (Dakota,               
              Ojibwe) as well as differences between men and women.                          
                                                                                             
              This research is important because alcohol abuse is a serious                  
              problem in urban Indian communities, and increased understanding               
              of how drinking is understood by different segments of the                     
              community can help health specialists develop intervention                     
              programs.
