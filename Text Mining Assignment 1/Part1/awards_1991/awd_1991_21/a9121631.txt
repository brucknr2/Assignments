Abstract    :
              This project contains three subprojects, in the first of which                 
              three models will be used to probe the transition structure                    
              preferences in the reaction of enoxysilanes with aldehydes.                    
              Double bond orientation, the role of Lewis acids and facial                    
              preferences with chiral Lewis acids will be studied.  The                      
              second subproject will develop general synthetic methodology                   
              involving the use of organotin reagents as nucleophiles for                    
              stereoselective opening of chiral acetals.  The third area of                  
              study involves development of a new class of chiral Lewis acids                
              based on strain-release Lewis acidity, the invention of a                      
              catalytic asymmetric aldol condensation, the study of a                        
              catalytic asymmetric allylation of aldehydes using                             
              metallacyclobutanes and preparation of a reagent for asymmetric                
              allylation of aldehydes using pentacoordinate siliconate                       
              complexes.                                                                     
              %%%                                                                            
              With this renewal award, the Synthetic Organic Program is                      
              supporting the research of Dr. Scott E. Denmark of the                         
              Department of Chemistry at the University of Illinois, Urbana.                 
              The primary objectives of the research are: 1) to elucidate                    
              those factors responsible for stereochemical control in an                     
              important family of reactions of silicon compounds 2) to expand                
              the synthetic utility of organotin reagents, and 3) to develop                 
              new catalytic reactions for asymmetric synthesis.  Asymmetric                  
              synthesis leads to the preferential production of only one of                  
              the many products possible from reactions of a complicated set                 
              of starting materials, and is of critical importance for the                   
              efficient synthesis of large organic molecules.
