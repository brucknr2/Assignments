Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Fundamental research directed toward improved understanding of                 
              metallic interactions with antimony-based semiconductors will be               
              conducted.  The research is of particular interest  for improving              
              the morphology, functionality, and stability of ohmic contacts                 
              and Schottky barriers to compound semiconductors.  The study is                
              material-structure based and includes detailed research on the                 
              electronic properties across metal-semiconductor and                           
              semiconductor-semiconductor interfaces.

              This research is expected to provide deeper fundamental                        
              understanding of metal-semiconductor and                                       
              semiconductor-semiconductor  growth, processing, and the                       
              fundamental electronic properties of such heterostructures.  From              
              an application point of view, understanding these processes and                
              properties is beneficial to semiconductor device design and                    
              fabrication.  The results will be of importance in a general way               
              to the technology of large scale, high speed integrated                        
              electronic and photonic devices and circuits.
