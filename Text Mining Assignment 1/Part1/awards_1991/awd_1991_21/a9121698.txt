Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The objective of this research is the investigate of the                  
              natural shapes of raindrops through laboratory, field and modeling             
              studies.  In the laboratory, a 28-meter shaft will be used to                  
              evaluate the role of aerodynamic feedback in the persistent                    
              oscillation for 1.5 to 4.0 mm diameter drops.  Additional                      
              experiments are planned for larger drops using a 100-meter fall                
              column.  Also, field measurements of drop oscillation spectra and              
              amplitudes in various types of rain will be conducted to examine               
              the roles of eddy shedding, drop collisions and turbulence in                  
              promoting raindrop oscillations.  The project includes the analysis            
              of aircraft data of raindrop shape as measured by an optical-array             
              probe during the Convective and Precipitation/Electrification                  
              Experiment in Florida (Summer 1991).  The causes of natural                    
              raindrop shapes will be evaluated using measurements of rain rates,            
              drop-size distributions, Doppler radar reflectivities and                      
              polarization.  Finally, models will be developed using these                   
              observations to characterize the variety of drop shapes in rain.               
              The semi-empirical distributions of natural raindrop shapes will be            
              applied to problems in microwave scattering and polarization.
