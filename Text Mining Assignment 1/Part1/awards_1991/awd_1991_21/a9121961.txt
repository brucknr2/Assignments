Abstract    :
                   This award is to purchase an IBM 540 server and assorted                  
              peripheral devices to support research in design automation for                
              single chip VLSI microprocessors, principles of design for high                
              performance VLSI microprocessors, USC Macro Data-Flow project,                 
              data-driven approach to programming multiprocessor systems,                    
              neurobiology and simulation of neural nets for invariant object                
              recognition.                                                                   
                                                                                             
              The University of Southern California will be investigating and                
              evaluating multiprocessor systems for use in the next generation of            
              computer systems.  The departments of Electrical Engineering-                  
              Systems and Computer Science will be purchasing a server and                   
              assorted peripheral devices to support research projects which                 
              rely upon extensive simulation of complex hardware and software                
              systems.
