Abstract    :
                   This grant covers experimental Elementary Particle                        
              Physics research by a group at Vanderbilt University in                        
              collaboration with other NSF and DOE supported scientists.                     
              The group will conclude studies of the production of                           
              jets of particles in high-energy photon-nucleus collisions by                  
              comparing the experimental yields with Quantum Chromodynamic                   
              calculations within the standard picture of interacting quarks                 
              and leptons.  The group plans to help construct a                              
              deep underwater cerenkov detector to study ultrahigh energy                    
              neutrino and muon induced cosmic ray showers and hence search                  
              for galactic or extragalactic point sources of ultrahigh                       
              energy cosmic rays.
