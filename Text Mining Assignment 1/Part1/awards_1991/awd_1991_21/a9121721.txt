Abstract    :
              This project's goal is to accelerate the rate of maturation of                 
              the new field of Scientific Database Studies, ultimately                       
              resulting in an electronic Journal of Scientific                               
              DatabaseResearch.  There are two project phases: the                           
              initialization phase lasts eight months and the crystallization                
              phase lasts sixteen months.  During the initialization phase,                  
              Argonne will set up a multi-user Bulletin Board service to                     
              disseminate news related to the NSF's Scientific Database                      
              activities, and provide an electronic forum for the exchange of                
              ideas.  A mass mailing announcing the Bulletin Board will be                   
              sent, asking for a one page position paper on the most important               
              issues to be addressed by researchers.  These will be examined                 
              and set into a taxonomy of issues, and the taxonomy distributed                
              as part of an initialmailing of a quarterly newsletter.  During                
              the crystallization phase the Bulletin Board will add features                 
              such as abstracts of reports, directories of researchers,                      
              calendars of events, and software available.  Scientific data                  
              visualization services will also be made available.  At the end                
              of the project the quarterly newsletter will be superseded by a                
              Journal published electronically.
