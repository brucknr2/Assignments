Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Fundamental research to elucidate phonon and electron-phonon                   
              properties of limited dimension electronic/photonic materials                  
              structures, particularly quantum well structures of compound                   
              semiconductors, and the recently discovered superconducting                    
              fullerenes, K3C60 and Rb3C60 will be conducted.  The research is of            
              particular interest  for providing a sounder scientific basis for              
              the improvement of epitaxial growth and materials processing                   
              techniques, critical to advanced electronics and photonics                     
              science and technology.                                                        
              %%%                                                                            
              This research is expected to provide deeper fundamental                        
              understanding of basic properties of electronic/photonic                       
              materials.  From an application point of view, understanding                   
              these properties and their relationship to materials synthesis                 
              and processing is beneficial to semiconductor device design and                
              fabrication.  The results will be of importance in a general way               
              to the technology of large scale, high speed integrated                        
              electronic and photonic devices and circuits.
