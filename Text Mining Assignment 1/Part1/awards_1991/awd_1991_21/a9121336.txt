Abstract    :
              This research concerns the effects of elevated                                 
              ambient and substrate temperatures (25oC to 400oC                              
              or higher) on the terminal characteristics of                                  
              integrated Silicon Carbide (hexagonal or 6H polytype                           
              - SiC) MOS Field-Effect transistors.  The work will                            
              focus on the detailed experimental and analytical                              
              modeling of large and small signal parameters of the                           
              transistors, with particular emphasis on leakage                               
              currents, on channel mobility, and on temperature-                             
              induced threshold voltage shifts with substrate bias.
