Abstract    :
                   Many existing models of international population migration                
              ignore the realities of migration circulation.  These                          
              circulations begin with movement from an origin country to a                   
              destination country, which ultimately lead to a return movement                
              of migrants back to their countries of origin.  Existing                       
              migration models focus on initial origin-designation migration or              
              on the subsequent return migration.  This project will develop a               
              framework that integrates all aspects of migration into a unified              
              model of international migration circulation.  Hypotheses will be              
              tested which evaluate the effects of immigrant stocks and                      
              economic and behavioral factors on migration circulation.  The                 
              study will employ a uniquely disaggregated data set of                         
              international migration to and from Germany from 1970 to 1989.  A              
              set of integrated logit models will be used to test the                        
              hypothesis that much international migration is described as a                 
              process of circulation.                                                        
                   The results of this project will enhance the understanding                
              of the dynamics of international circulations.  By simulating the              
              effects of different migration policy scenarios, the model will                
              be able to differentiate the impact of national policy on                      
              migration over the short run and the long run.
