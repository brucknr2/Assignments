Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A major goal of neuroscience is to determine the causal                        
              relationships between patterns of neural activity and consequent               
              behaviors.  This award to Dr. Alvin Murphy focuses on the                      
              behavioral consequences of divers patterns of neural activity in               
              identified neurons of the buccal ganglion of a snail.  The studies             
              will combine intracellular recordings from identified nerve  cells             
              with simultaneous videotapes of musculature that subserves feeding             
              movements and other oral behaviors.  Behaviors will be monitored               
              directly along with intracellular and extracellular recordings from            
              neurons and  muscles.  Intracellular dye and tracer substance                  
              injections will be made to study how neurons are interconnected.               
              Videotapes and tension measurements from muscles will be correlated            
              with activity in the nerve cells and during behaviors.                         
              Pharmacological treatment or manipulation of sensory stimuli such              
              as food will be used to determine the functional efficacy of the               
              various neural patterns produced by this multifunctional pattern               
              generator.  these studies on s simple model system will contribute             
              to fundamental knowledge about how the nervous system controls                 
              behavior.
