Abstract    :
              1he Department of Chemistry at the University of Colorado at                   
              Boulder will use this award from the Chemical Research                         
              Instrumentation Program to help acquire a Fourier transform                    
              infrared (FTIR) spectrometer.  The areas of chemical research                  
              that will be enhanced by the acquisition include the following:                
                                                                                             
              1.  Identification of High Energy Intermediates in the                         
                   Peroxyoxalate Chemiluminescence Reaction.                                 
                                                                                             
              2.  IR-VIS-UV Spectroscopy as a Probe of Molecular Structure                   
                   and Organization.                                                         
                                                                                             
              3.  Heterogeneous Photoreactivity of Photoreactive                             
                   Atmospheric Molecules.                                                    
                                                                                             
              Fourier Transorm Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy is a technique                   
              that uses absorption of infrared energy to probe molecular                     
              structure.  When used in conjunction with a modern computer,                   
              FTIR studies on large numbers of samples can be conveniently                   
              carried out and the resulting data readily analyzed.  The use                  
              of FTIR spectroscopy is essential to chemists who are carrying                 
              out research in many important frontier areas.
