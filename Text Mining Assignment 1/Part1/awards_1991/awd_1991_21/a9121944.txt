Abstract    :
                   There is a clear need for the development of a dating                     
              technique that can provide reliable chronologic control for                    
              sediments deposited in polar marine and lacustrine environments                
              during the late and middle Quaternary.  This award supports a                  
              series of fundamental investigations to ascertain the utility of               
              the emerging photoluminescence (PL) technique to date waterlain                
              sediments.  The energy selective analysis of PL potentially could              
              supply a widely applicable and accurate geochronometer.                        
              Specifically, these experiments will test the accuracy and                     
              precision of the PL technique to date lacustrine and near-shore                
              marine sediments from Spitsbergen, Svalbard.  The sediments                    
              chosen for study are either modern or radiocarbon dated sediments              
              from exposures or cores that were deposited during the last ca.                
              12 thousand years.  These sediments are from a variety of aqueous              
              sedimentary environments and the proposed research should provide              
              coherent results to evaluate the promises and limitations of the               
              PL technique.  This project represents one element of the PALE                 
              (Paleoclimates form Arctic Lakes and Estuaries) activity.
