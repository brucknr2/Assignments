Abstract    :
              The Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program of the                     
              Chemistry Division is supporting research by Professor Cina on                 
              numerical and analytical studies of the time evolution of                      
              electronic geometric phase factors under large amplitude                       
              nuclear motion in polyatomic molecules.  Dynamics calculations                 
              pertinent to oriented and unoriented samples are being used to                 
              investigate the possibility of experimental observation of                     
              quantum adiabatic phase effects.  Theoretical studies of                       
              ultrafast phase-coherent optical spectroscopy on interacting                   
              chemical systems are also being carried out.                                   
              %%%                                                                            
              It may be possible to use laser irradiation to direct and                      
              control the course of chemical reactions.  In order to achieve                 
              this objective, the pathways for redistribution of energy                      
              within an absorbing molecule must be better understood.                        
              Professor Cina's theoretical calculations are intended to probe                
              the possibility for a number of seminal experiments in this                    
              field.
