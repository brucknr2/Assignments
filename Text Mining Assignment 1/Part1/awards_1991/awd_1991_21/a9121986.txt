Abstract    :
                   During the International Geophysical Year (IGY) in 1957-8                 
              Professor Keeling of Scripps Institution of Oceanography initiated             
              a high precision atmospheric CO2 measurements program at Mauna Loa,            
              Hawaii to study the biogeochemical carbon cycle.  This measurement             
              program has been continued and expanded since that time.  In the               
              early 1960's the data set available from this program demonstrated             
              conclusively that the carbon dioxide concentration in the                      
              atmosphere was increasing at a rate of approximately a third of one            
              percent per year.  This increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide is              
              caused primarily by the combustion of fossil fuels.  Since CO2 is              
              a "greenhouse gas" it is expected that within a few decades its                
              increased atmospheric concentration will lead to climatic changes.             
              Among the central issues of the CO2 question is the reliability of             
              predictions of future concentrations.  Such predictions require an             
              understanding of the biogeochemical carbon cycle.  Presently,                  
              however, there are major uncertainties about the CO2 gas exchange              
              processes involving the oceans and terrestrial biosphere.  The goal            
              of this research project is to gather the type of data which can be            
              used to obtain a more reliable estimate of the oceanic and                     
              biospheric carbon dioxide sink and source strengths.                           
                   In this research project emphasis will be on the measurement              
              of the carbon isotopic composition of CO2 in the atmosphere and                
              oceans as a function of space and time.  Additionally, high                    
              precision measurements of dissolved carbon dioxide will be made at             
              key locations in surface and subsurface ocean water.  These, and               
              supporting chemical measurements, will be used to atmosphere by the            
              combustion of fossil fuels.
