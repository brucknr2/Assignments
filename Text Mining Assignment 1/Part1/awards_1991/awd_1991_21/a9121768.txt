Abstract    :
                   This award is to purchase high-speed workstations, high-                  
              resolution cameras, digitizers, and actuator-control                           
              equipment to enhance an existing pair of industrial-quality                    
              robot arms.  The equipment will support research projects in                   
              real-time collision avoidance, integration of stereo range                     
              estimation and cooperative manipulation, planning for real-                    
              time control in real environments, and planning and                            
              simulation.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              Virginia Polytechnic Institute will purchase equipment to                      
              support several research projects in the area of real-time                     
              control of robotic manipulation tasks.  The research will                      
              center on the cooperative use of artificial intelligence                       
              techniques, machine vision, efficient world models, and                        
              hierarchical design for robust planning and control.
