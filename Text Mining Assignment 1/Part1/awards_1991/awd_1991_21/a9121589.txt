Abstract    :
              This award is made as the starter grant increment of Dr. Chad                  
              Mirkin's Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Chemistry award in                
              support of his research at Northwestern University. Early                      
              transition metal metallocene-mediated, electrocatalytic oxygen                 
              atom transfer reactions will be studied. The goal of the                       
              research will be to develop electrocatalytic oxidation                         
              reactions by electrochemically, photochemically and chemically                 
              generating highly reactive organometallic species bound to a                   
              polymer support for use as oxygen atom transfer catalysts.                     
              Oxygen atom sources will be carbon dioxide and water and                       
              typical substrates will be olefins. Expected products will be                  
              epoxides and ketones. Catalyst species will be site-isolated on                
              supported surfaces and spectroscopically characterized.                        
              Individual steps in the catalytic cycle will be defined by                     
              infrared and ESR spectroscopy.

              Catalytic oxygen atom transfer reactions are of great                          
              commercial importance. The epoxidation of olefins is currently                 
              carried out on a large scale. New, more efficient catalysts                    
              could have a major impact both on commercial technology as well                
              as on understanding fundamental oxidation mechanisms.
