Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The PIs wish to determine the vertical transport of ice in                
              clouds and the clouds' mechanism in controlling the concentration              
              of water vapor in the upper troposphere.  They will use a stable               
              isotope method, and propose to simultaneously collect ice and vapor            
              samples, as well as to gather supporting in situ thermodynamic,                
              cloud physics, and satellite data.  The project goal is to                     
              determine the formation altitude of ice in the tops of winter                  
              frontal and summer convective clouds and the relative role of cloud            
              ice and vapor as a supplier of water vapor in the upper                        
              troposphere.
