Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The goal of the RIDGE (Ridge Inter-Disciplinary Global                    
              Experiments) program is to understand the geophysical,                         
              geochemical and geobiological causes and consequences of energy                
              transfer within the global rift system through time.  This grant               
              is to support the RIDGE Coordinating Office which provides a                   
              focal point for the planning, organization, and communications                 
              essential to the development of a successful program. The RIDGE                
              Office has a variety of program responsibilities including the                 
              development and implementation of the RIDGE science plan,                      
              organizing planning meetings and workshops as needed, holding                  
              conferences like the RIDGE Theoretical Institute, producing and                
              distributing a semi-annual newsletter, coordinating timely                     
              scientific responses to major earthquake or volcanic events on                 
              the mid-ocean ridge, implementing a RIDGE-oriented data                        
              management and archiving system, and pursuing international                    
              collaborative research efforts on a bilateral and multilateral                 
              level.
