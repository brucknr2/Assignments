Abstract    :
              At an NSF-funded workshop held in 1988 the process of                          
              establishing a network of well-documented geotechnical                         
              experimentation sites in the United States, open to all                        
              interested researchers, was initiated. The objective is the                    
              proposed workshop is to identify the sites to be developed,                    
              establish guidelines for their use, and select a System                        
              Management Board.
