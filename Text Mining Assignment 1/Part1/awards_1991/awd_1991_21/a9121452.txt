Abstract    :
              This multi-investigator, multi-disciplinary proposal is focused on             
              magnetic and optical properties of semiconductors containing                   
              magnetic ions, so-called dilute magnetic semiconductors (DMS).                 
              Both semiconductor heterostructures and bulk crystalline material              
              will be investigated.  The program involves a unique combination of            
              high magnetic fields, low temperatures, advanced optical                       
              techniques, and new materials development.  The majority of the                
              experiments will be conducted at the National Magnet Lab.  The                 
              collaboration involves several universities, industrial labs, both             
              theory and experiment, as well as DMS workers in Poland.  The DMS              
              materials display a range of scientifically interesting and                    
              technologically important properties, including optical effects                
              like large Faraday rotation and transport phenomena such as the so-            
              called giant magnetoresistance effect.  Both are of interest for               
              possible application as information storage technologies.
