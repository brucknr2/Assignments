Abstract    :
                   This award is to purchase manipulation and sensor and                     
              control processing equipment for projects in intelligent                       
              distributed control of materials handling, object                              
              manipulation using tactile sensing, coordinated motion and                     
              grasp planning, and finding surface boundaries in images.                      
              The award will allow the University of California, Berkeley                    
              to expand its RobotWorld system, update its LYMPH                              
              multiprocessor, and acquire a frame grabber and color camera                   
              to support fast image acquisition and processing.                              
                                                                                             
              University of California, Berkeley will be purchasing                          
              manipulation and sensor and control processing equipment to                    
              support research in robotics and computer vision.  The                         
              equipment will include an expansion of its RobotWorld system,                  
              an update to its LYMPH multiprocessor, and a frame grabber                     
              and color camera.
