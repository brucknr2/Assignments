Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will address the problem of                    
              constructing a class of quasi-(translation) invariant probability              
              measures on an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space.  The measures               
              to be studied are those induced by Hilbert-valued stochastic                   
              differential equations of elliptic type.  The proposer has                     
              previously shown such measures to be differentiable, and has also              
              established a relationship between the properties of measure                   
              differentiability and quasi-invariance.  He now intends to                     
              investigate hypotheses which will allow him to combine these                   
              results, towards the desired end.  The main difficulty is the                  
              verification of certain regularity properties of the induced                   
              measures.  He intends to address this problem via a method of                  
              time-reversal for diffusions.                                                  
                   The principal investigator is studying certain properties of              
              stochastic differential equations (sde's), a type of equation                  
              which arises from the dynamics of a physical system which is                   
              subject to random fluctuations.  (A typical example of such a                  
              system is the position of an aircraft, whose motion is influenced              
              by erratic atmospheric conditions.)  Building on some of his                   
              previous work in this area, the reviewer intends to study the so               
              called quasi-invariance properties of solutions to sde's.  The                 
              quasi-invariance problem is related to quantum field theory and                
              as such is also of interest to mathematical physicists.
