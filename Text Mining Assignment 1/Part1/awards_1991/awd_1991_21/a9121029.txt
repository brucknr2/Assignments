Abstract    :
              This is an award to support conduct of a Symposium on the                      
              current status and emerging issues in aquatic chemistry                        
              that are of significance in environmental engineering                          
              design and practice.  This symposium is planned to be                          
              conducted in associative relationship with a national                          
              meeting of the American Chemical Society in the spring of                      
              1992.  Major topics for the symposium, scheduled for April                     
              8 and 9, 1992 include surface phenomena that affect                            
              chemical reactions in aquatic systems, aspects of earth                        
              contact, biological processes, oxidation-reduction and                         
              photocatalyzed reactions in dilute aqueous solutions that                      
              affect  engineering approaches to management of water                          
              quality.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              Results of this Symposium are expected to provide guidance                     
              to the Environmental and Ocean Systems Program in planning                     
              and conduct of research in aquatic chemistry applicable to                     
              the dispersion, diffusion and interactions of chemical                         
              pollutants in the  environment.
