Abstract    :
              This travel grant from the Organic Dynamics Program will                       
              provide a portion of the expenses required for US scientists to                
              attend the XIV IUPAC Symposium on Photochemistry at the                        
              University of Leuven in Belgium from July 19-25, 1992. The                     
              conference will focus on various aspects of both applied and                   
              basic photochemistry and photophysics. Issues involved in                      
              photobiology, photopolymers, small molecule photochemistry,                    
              interstellar photochemistry, and the environmental implications                
              of photochemical events will be highlighted by presentations                   
              from a distinguished array of speakers from around the world.                  
              The challenge travel grants provided to US investigators will                  
              insure that there will be an adequate representation from the                  
              United States at this strategic scientific meeting in the field                
              of photochemistry.                                                             
              %%%                                                                            
              Formal presentations at the meeting will range from discussions                
              of the factors which govern the use of light to make and                       
              process silicon chips for electronics applications to                          
              the use of energy from pulsed lasers to probe the way in which                 
              many biological processes are stimulated by the absorption of                  
              light. The role of light in the oxidation of contaminants in                   
              water supplies, as well as the reactivity of chemical species                  
              in interstellar atmospheres, will also be discussed.
