Abstract    :
                   This research program uses coherent optical radiation to                  
              probe the dynamics of collisions between atoms in an excited                   
              state.  By measuring the absorption of light and its                           
              subsequent emission as a function of its frequency, the                        
              details of the quasimolecular collision intermediate structure                 
              can be delineated.  Professor Havey will use the polarization                  
              properties of the light to measure the amount of alignment and                 
              orientation that can be transmitted from the reactant atoms to                 
              the final                                                                      
              products.
