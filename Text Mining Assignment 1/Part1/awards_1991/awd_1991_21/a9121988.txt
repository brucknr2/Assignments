Abstract    :
                   The I/UCR Center for Hazardous Substance Management (HSMRC)               
              at the New Jersey Institute of Technology plans to form an Asian               
              Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Partnership for Science and                
              Engineering with one or more colleges/universities in Indonesia.               
              One of these institutions will serve as the lead institution of an             
              academic consortium in Indonesia which will participate in the                 
              partnership.  The consortium concept offers the opportunity to                 
              access a broader range of expertise than that which can be offered             
              by a single university to address hazardous waste management                   
              issues.  The academic consortium in Indonesia will serve as a                  
              nucleus for the formation of an Industry/University Cooperative                
              Research Center which will carry out at the academic institutions,             
              a research program in the area of waste management of value and                
              interest to the industrial participants in the cooperative research            
              center.  Faculty and students from Indonesia will participate in               
              educational and research programs at the HSMRC; HSMRC faculty will             
              participate in the Indonesian institutions' research activities;               
              and there will be possibilities for development of interactive                 
              economic and business endeavors by the corporate membership of the             
              two linked Cooperative Research Centers in Indonesia and in the                
              U.S.  This Center, once established, will train personnel to:  a)              
              address the waste management concerns of Indonesia's industry and              
              provide solutions compatible with local requirements and conditions            
              and b) contribute to the development of an infrastructure that will            
              lead to sustainable development of Indonesia's economy.  The I/UCRC            
              concept is appropriate to address the environmental concerns of                
              Indonesia's industry.  The academic industrial cooperative effort              
              allows academia to recognize industry's problems and develop                   
              strategies to best address these problems with solutions that can              
              be implemented by industry.  This award will be for $100,000 for               
              24 months.
