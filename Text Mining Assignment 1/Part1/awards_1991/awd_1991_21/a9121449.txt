Abstract    :
                   Using measurements of cosmogenic 35S and 7Be in aerosols and              
              precipitation collections and gas (35SO2), the PIs plan to                     
              1determine, on a monthly timescale, the following properties of 35S            
              as a function of time:  (1) the rate of 35SO2 oxidation, (2) the               
              fraction of 35SO4 in wet deposition originating from in-cloud                  
              oxidation, (3) the mean residence time of 35SO4 aerosol and (4) the            
              "dry" deposition flux of 35SO2.  The concentrations of the two                 
              nuclides in the various components measured and the wet                        
              precipitation fluxes of each (combined with the effective                      
              production ratio) provides a complete analysis of the fate of 35SO2            
              in the atmosphere).  The PIs intend to make measurements on a                  
              monthly basis to define the seasonal variations in the parameters              
              controlling the removal of 35SO2 from the atmosphere.  The PIs                 
              desire to show that 35S and stable S are homogenized in the                    
              boundary                                                                       
              layer box on a monthly timescale, in which case the results                    
              obtained from 35S are directly applicable to ordinary gaseous SO2              
              and a complete evaluation of the atmospheric SO2 system as a                   
              function of locale and season will be obtained.
