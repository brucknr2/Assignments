Abstract    :
              In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the                       
              Chemistry Division, Professor James Reilly of Indiana                          
              University will use high resolution overtone spectroscopy to                   
              study highly vibrationally excited polyatomic molecules seeded                 
              in supersonic expansions.  He will search for high resolution                  
              structure indicative of weak vibrational mode couplings in                     
              selected compounds as well as look at molecules with broad,                    
              structureless room temperature spectra.  The goal is to begin                  
              to understand vibrational mode mixing and dynamics in highly                   
              excited molecules.

              When excess energy is deposited into vibrational modes of                      
              polyatomic molecules, that is, those molecules composed of                     
              several atoms, that energy can dissipate internally by                         
              redistributing among the other vibrations in the molecule, or                  
              it may be given up to other atoms or molecules with which the                  
              excited molecule collides.  This project aims at studying the                  
              ways in which such excess vibrational energy flows out of the                  
              initially excited parts of a molecule.  Such information is                    
              important to scientists interested in understanding how the                    
              excess energy released in chemical reactions can affect the                    
              course of these reactions.
