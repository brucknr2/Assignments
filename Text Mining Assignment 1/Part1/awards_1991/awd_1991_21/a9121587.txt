Abstract    :
                   Precision measurements of the properties of elementary                    
              particles play an important role in testing the validity of                    
              quantum electrodynamics (QED).  Professor Gabrielse is measuring               
              precisely the natural frequencies of a single electron confined                
              in a specially constructed charged-particle trap.  He will                     
              measure the electron magnetic moment, and exploit the                          
              one-electron cyclotron oscillator to study hysteresis adn                      
              bistability in this particularly simple system exhibiting                      
              nonlinearity.
