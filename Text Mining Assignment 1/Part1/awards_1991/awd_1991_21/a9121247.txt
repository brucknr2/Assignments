Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              The primary objectives of this U.S.-Poland research project                    
              between Dr. Tatsuro Ichiishi of the Ohio State University and Dr.              
              Adam Idzik of the Institute of Computer Science of the Polish                  
              Academy of Sciences involve research in three areas:  fixed point              
              theorems; cooperative games in a Bayesian framework; and                       
              cooperative solutions to general models involving economies of                 
              scale in production.                                                           
                                                                                             
              This project in economics fulfills the program objective of                    
              advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the              
              United States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary                      
              talents and pool resources in areas of strong mutual interest and              
              competence.
