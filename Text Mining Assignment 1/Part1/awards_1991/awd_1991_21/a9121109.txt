Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program                 
              will help the Department of Chemistry at Yale University                       
              acquire a 300 MHz spectrometer which will be used in research                  
              investigations which range from synthesis of natural products                  
              and other biologically active compounds to elucidation of                      
              reaction mechanisms, determination of energies and                             
              conformations or organic molecules and development of                          
              organometallic reagents for sterocontrolled synthesis.                         
                                                                                             
              Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy is the most                      
              powerful tool available to the chemist for the elucidation of                  
              the structure of molecules.  It is used to identify unknown                    
              substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within                 
              molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between                   
              molecules in solution.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR                         
              spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out                     
              frontier research.  The results from these NMR studies are                     
              useful in areas such as polymers and catalysis, and in biology.
