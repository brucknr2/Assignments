Abstract    :
              This project, in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program,                  
              will explore the thermodynamics of Lewis acid-base interactions                
              of polyfunctional hosts with monofunctional guests.                            
              Interactions of both acidic and basic hosts will be examined.                  
              Solvent effects on reactions involving neutral reactants will                  
              be explored using a linear free energy relationship model                      
              developed by the principal investigators.  The enthalpies and                  
              entropies determined for these systems will be compared with                   
              those of reactions of similar monofunctional hosts.  Techniques                
              to be utilized in these investigations are calorimetry and                     
              multinuclear NMR spectroscopy.

              The Lewis acid-base model, in which an electron pair donor                     
              reacts with an electron pair acceptor, is one of the most                      
              useful in accounting for the regiochemistry of a wide variety                  
              of chemical reactions.  Thermochemical data, such as that to be                
              obtained in this work, have great predictive value for the                     
              behavior of related acids and bases.
