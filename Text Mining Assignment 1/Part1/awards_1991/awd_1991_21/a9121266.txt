Abstract    :
                   A visual signal, as recorded on the retina of an animal or                
              by a TV camera, differs from many signals analyzed by engineers                
              in that it is produced by a world with many overlapping objects                
              and shadows, and, to "decode" the signal, these must be teased                 
              apart so as to reconstruct the world geometry.  Most classical                 
              techniques smooth over the discontinuities in the signal produced              
              by this multiplicity of effects, making it harder to separate                  
              them and reconstruct the world geometry.  The PI plans to use new              
              techniques involving variational problems for discontinuous maps               
              to attack some of these problems.  He also seeks to compare this               
              mathematical approach with the neural techniques by which animals              
              solve the problem.  To do this, he will study "neural net"                     
              implementations and formulate experiments to study how close                   
              these nets are to the true neural activities in animals.  The                  
              goal is to understand mathematically one of the most remarkable                
              cognitive abilities of living organisms.                                       
                   Vision is a focal point of research activity in                           
              computational science, as well as HPCC.
