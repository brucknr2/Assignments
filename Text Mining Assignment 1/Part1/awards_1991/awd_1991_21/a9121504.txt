                                         ABSTRACT                                            
                                                                                            
              The aim of the project is the publication of the Grammar of                    
              Mupun.  Mupun is a West Chadic language, spoken in the Plataeu                 
              State of Nigeria.  The Grammar and an accompanying Dictionary are              
              the first full descriptions of this language and also the most                 
              complete body of information on any language from the Angas                    
              group, to which Mupun belongs.  The two books were written with                
              the support of an NSF grant.  The dictionary received a Kayden                 
              Prize in the Humanities, an award that provides support for the                
              publication of the book.  The Grammar presents a number of                     
              analyses and facts of interest for general linguistics.  In                    
              addition, observation in the field indicates that the language is              
              in extremely vulnerable situation because the educated youth are               
              more and more replacing Mupun in their daily speech by eith Hausa              
              or English.  The Grammar and the Dictionary will be thus the                   
              record of a language in jeopardy of extinction within a few                    
              generations.
