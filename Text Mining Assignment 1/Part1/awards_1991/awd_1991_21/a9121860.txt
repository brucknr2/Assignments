Abstract    :
                    This award is for the purchase of a multiple degree of                   
              freedom, high precision, light weight stereo camera head.                      
              The same equipment is being purchased at three other                           
              institutions in a shared research effort.  Research topics                     
              include gaze control and target tracking, stereo and motion                    
              analysis, landmark-based navigation, automatic acquisition of                  
              object and environmental models, hand-eye coordination,                        
              dextrous manipulation with multi-fingered hands, real-time                     
              perception and manipulation.  System software, algorithms and                  
              subsystems will be shared across the institutions.                             
                                                                                             
              The University of Massachusetts will be purchasing equipment                   
              to support a multi-institutional shared research effort in                     
              active vision for robot navigation and manipulation.  Other                    
              members of the consortium are the University of Pennsylvania,                  
              University of Maryland and the University of Rochester.  Each                  
              institution will acquire the same state-of-the-art binocular                   
              camera head of high precision and high speed, and will share                   
              in the development of systems software and application                         
              software.
