Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Workers in the fields of behavioral ecology and evolutionary                   
              biology have long been grappling with the general question of                  
              how complex behaviors may evolve.  Although comparative                        
              approaches have provided insight into plausible mechanisms,                    
              there is ultimately no substitute for experimental test.                       
              Manipulative field experiments are one of the most powerful and                
              convincing (yet rarely used) means at our disposal for testing                 
              hypothesis about the evolution of behaviors.  This research by                 
              Dr. Van den Berghe will be the first experimental test of                      
              several hypotheses that have been proposed as ultimate                         
              explanations for why parental care evolves in marine fishes.                   
              The hypotheses are not mutually exclusive and may all apply.                   
              In this study, he will test the importance of mate                             
              availability, juvenile survival, and cost tradeoffs in                         
              independent field experiments to see which of these factors may                
              be critical for the evolution and maintenance of parental care                 
              in a species with facultative care.
