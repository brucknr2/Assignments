Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project seeks to achieve a fundamental understanding of the               
              behavior of the dopants (controlled impurity atoms) needed to                  
              obtain desired levels of electrical conductivity of crystalline                
              zinc selenide (ZnSe), a II-VI compound semiconductor material.                 
              This material has important potential applications such as solid               
              state devices which emit blue light, including lasers, which are               
              not currently available.  Such devices would provide advantages for            
              optical information storage systems, full color displays, laser                
              printers, and other purposes.  However, the inability to control               
              the conductivity of ZnSe in the way commonly done with other                   
              semiconducting materials has thus far prevented its use for such               
              practical applications.  Sophisticated optical spectroscopy with               
              and without the influence of intense magnetic fields, and                      
              electrical measurements are being employed to explore the behavior             
              of various impurities in the material, and to determine which ones             
              are most suitable for controlling its conductivity in the way that             
              is necessary for device applications.  Close collaborations with               
              industrial crystal growers are an important part of the program.
