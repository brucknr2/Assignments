Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will continue his study of non-                
              self-dual Yang-Mills connections. The existence of these                       
              connections on any bundle satisfying a topological condition was               
              recently proved by Sadun and the principal investigator. He will               
              now use algebraic and analytic methods to attempt to obtain                    
              additional topological and geometric information. Spectacular                  
              geometric results about four-dimensional manifolds were obtained               
              from a study of the self-dual Yang-Mills moduli spaces and it is               
              hoped that equally important breakthroughs will result from a study            
              of the non-self-dual case.                                                     
                   The Yang-Mills equations were first studied by physicists in              
              an attempt to create a unified field theory. Deep mathematical                 
              techniques were needed to analyze these equations and it soon                  
              became apparent that this area of mathematical physics possessed a             
              fascinating algebraic and geometric structure. The field has                   
              developed to become one which is important both to physics and                 
              mathematics and in which ideas from each discipline contribute to              
              the other.
