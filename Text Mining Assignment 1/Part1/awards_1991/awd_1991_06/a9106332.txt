Abstract    :
                   The principal investigators will continue their studies of                
              various mathematical models of propagating cracks in linear and                
              nonlinear elastic and viscoelastic materials.  For the models of               
              linear materials interest will focus upon dynamic crack growth in              
              viscoelastic materials and interfacial fractures in both elastic               
              and viscoelastic materials.  For the models of nonlinear                       
              materials interest will focus upon the development and                         
              implementation of finite element methods for the numerical                     
              simulation of growing cracks in viscoelastic materials.                        
                   Crack propagation phenomena appear in a variety of                        
              technologically important areas.  For example, due to the                      
              increased use of polymers and polymer-based composites there is a              
              genuine need for understanding the nature of fracture processes                
              in viscoelastic materials.  In this project the principal                      
              investigators will apply analytical and numerical methods to                   
              study the propagation of cracks in mathematical models of elastic              
              and viscoelastic materials.
