Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program                 
              and the National Facilities and Instrumentation Program will                   
              help the Department of Chemistry at Columbia University acquire                
              a SQUID based magnetometer.  Among the areas of chemical                       
              research that will be enhanced by the acquisition are the                      
              following:  (1) investigations of the transition temperatures                  
              and critical current densities of metal-substituted and oxygen                 
              doped high-temperature copper oxide superconductors;  (2)                      
              studies of the effects of metal substitution on the charge                     
              density wave and superconducting states in transition metal                    
              dichalcogenide materials; (3)  measurements of radical yields                  
              and investigations of radical pair interactions in the                         
              photolysis of ketones on porous solids; and (4) studies of                     
              magnetism in novel high-spin and chiral organic solids.                        
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
              A magnetometer measures the force a material experiences when                  
              subjected to a magnetic field gradient.  A paramagnetic                        
              substance consists of molecular magnetic dipoles which tend to                 
              orient themselves parallel to the direction of the field.  The                 
              lining up of the magnetic dipoles is opposed by the thermal                    
              motion of the particles, and in a paramagnetic substance at                    
              room temperature only a small fraction of the molecules have                   
              their magnetic moments aligned with the field.  The measurement                
              of the volume magnetic susceptibility is positive for                          
              paramagnetic substances and negative for diamagnetic                           
              substances.  The magnetometer is useful in studying high                       
              temperature superconducting materials, radical yields, and                     
              research dealing in solid state chemistry.
