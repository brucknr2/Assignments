Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The International Council of Scientific Union (ICSU) will                      
              expand its efforts to plan for and to improve international                    
              coordinationm of global change research. To this end ICSU's new                
              Advisory Committee on the Environment will oversee and                         
              coordinated the various ICSU programs and other activities                     
              related to global change research. These include the                           
              International Geosphere-biosphere Program (IGBP); global                       
              change-related activities of ICSU standing committees, such as                 
              those of the Scientific Committee on Oceanic Researh (SCOR);                   
              and global change-related programs of ICSU unions. A new ICSU                  
              science officer for global change will staff the Advisory                      
              Committee on the Environment; organize ICSU forums on global                   
              change issues; serve as ICSU liaison with other international                  
              organizations and private industry groups concerned with global                
              change research; and ensure effective implementation of the                    
              ICSU Strategy on Global Change.
