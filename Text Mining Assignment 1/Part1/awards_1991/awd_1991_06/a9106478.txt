Abstract    :
              Transition metal complexes in which two or more metal atoms are                
              linked by various aryldiimido bridging bridging groups will be                 
              synthesized and studied.  These bridging groups have the                       
              important advantage that electronic communication in a new                     
              domain of high oxidation state metal complexes can be                          
              systematically examined.  First homo- and then heterometallic                  
              dimeric systems will be studied to probe the fundamental                       
              chemistry of the linked transition metal fragments and to                      
              identify perturbations caused by the introduction of the                       
              heterometal-imido unit, respectively.  In the final stage of                   
              the project the chemistry of multimetallic systems, i.e.,                      
              polymers with aryldiimido linkages, will be investigated.                      
              Electrochemical, spectroelectrochemical, variable-temperature                  
              magnetic, and diffraction studies will be performed in                         
              collaboration with workers at other instututions.

              In this project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and                            
              Organometallic Program of the Chemistry Division, Dr. Eric A.                  
              Maatta of Kansas State University will synthesize and                          
              characterize complexes of early transition metals, in high                     
              oxidation states, that are bridged or held together by                         
              aryldiimido ligands.  These compounds will include a variety of                
              polymeric materials that may have very useful properties as                    
              conductors.
