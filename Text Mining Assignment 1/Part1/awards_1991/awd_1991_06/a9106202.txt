Abstract    :
                   This award request is intended as support for advanced                    
              academic research and applied studies in the multidisciplinary                 
              topic of enhanced in situ biorestoration of hazardous waste                    
              contaminated terrestrial, aquatic and marine environments. The                 
              proposal addresses the need for: (1) the fundamental factors                   
              controlling biodegradation of toxic organics; (2) how combinations             
              of anaerobic and aerobic treatment can be used to compliment each              
              other; (3) in situ detoxification of mixed-type contaminants using             
              local microbiology treatment; and (4) low-cost, efficient in-ground            
              remediation of recalcitrant toxicants, including trace metals                  
              removal and recovery of metal values.                                          
                                                                                             
                   The purpose of this research project is to employ modern                  
              techniques from basic and applied research areas to elucidate the              
              chemical mechanisms of microbial ecology responsible for                       
              detoxifying anthropogenic contaminants in the environment.
