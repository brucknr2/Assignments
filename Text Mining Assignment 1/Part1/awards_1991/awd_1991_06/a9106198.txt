Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award supports infrastructure for research and education                  
              computer communications networking in the Pacific region. It is                
              made to the University of Hawaii Manoa for operation of the Pacific            
              Communications Network (PACCOM). PACCOM is a regional initiative in            
              the Pacific area with the objective of providing common                        
              communications services to the academic and research sector of each            
              member nation (currently, the U.S., through the University of                  
              Hawaii's computer network, Australia, Japan, Korea and New                     
              Zealand). PACCOM circuits and operations support the connections               
              among the research and academic networks of the member countries,              
              but not the networks themselves. NSF, NASA and the Department of               
              Energy share the costs of the U.S. portions of the international               
              circuits, in accordance with the guidelines of the Coordinating                
              Committee for Intercontinental Research Networking. PACCOM circuits            
              terminate in the U.S. at a multi-agency interconnection point at               
              NASA's Ames Research Center in Mountainview, California. The NSFNET            
              node at Stanford University, Palo Alto, California connects to the             
              multi-agency interconnection point.***
