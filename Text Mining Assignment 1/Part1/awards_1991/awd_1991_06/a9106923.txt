Abstract    :
              This research will focus on several issues critical to the                     
              development of the proposed quick prototyping system for multichip             
              modules (MCMs).  These issues are:  1) the detailed design of the              
              workcenter; 2) the experimental demonstration of the accuracy and              
              repeatability of two critical units in the workcenter--the                     
              photoplotter and the pick-and-place robot; 3) the evaluation of the            
              solder joint's electrical resistance; 4) the complete description              
              of the user-interface of the workcenter; (5) the electroless                   
              plating for single-chip solder bumping; and 6) the explicit                    
              comparison to MCC's QTAI and GE's High-Density Interconnect (HDI)              
              alternative methods.  Although the system is proposed for quick                
              prototyping, the manufacturing requirements in these issues are                
              being addressed.  The requirements for manufacturing are more                  
              demanding than those for prototyping.
