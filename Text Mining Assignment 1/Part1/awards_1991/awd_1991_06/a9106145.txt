Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Although people have migrated to the U.S. from Asia                       
              throughout most of the last two centuries, historical and                      
              geographical studies of immigration and immigrant settlement in                
              the United States have focused primarily on European relocation                
              to North America.  This doctoral dissertation project will                     
              examine the migration of the Chinese who came to live in                       
              Pennsylvania between 1860 and 1920.  Documentary and archival                  
              research will be used to examine the roles of individuals and                  
              institutions in the relocation to the U.S.  Special attention                  
              will be given to the ways that Chinese and American institutions               
              affected family structures and locational patterns of Chinese                  
              immigrants.                                                                    
                                                                                             
                   This project will add to our understanding of the interplay               
              between individual motivations and institutional elements that                 
              influence the time and place of migration and settlement.  It                  
              will broaden our view of the nature of migration and settlement                
              in the United States by presenting a balanced view of the                      
              Chinese, an historically underrepresented ethnic group.  This                  
              project also will provide an excellent opportunity for a                       
              promising young scholar to continue to develop independent                     
              research skills.
