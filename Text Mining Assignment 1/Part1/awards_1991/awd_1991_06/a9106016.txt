Abstract    :
              The principal investigators will study the high-pressure                       
              metamorphic rocks of the Oman continental margin, utilizing field,             
              petrologic, stable isotopic, and fluid inclusion methods.  They                
              will attempt to determine fluid fluxes, chemical composition, and              
              provenance of the fluid, as well as pressure-temperature conditions            
              that attended different stages of the metamorphism.  The study will            
              also provide data critical to the interpretation  of the tectonic              
              history of the region.
