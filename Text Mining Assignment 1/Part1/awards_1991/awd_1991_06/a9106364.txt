Abstract    :
              All cellular RNA molecules are synthesized as immature                         
              precursors bearing 5' or 3' terminal extensions which must be                  
              removed during RNA maturation or processing.  Despite the                      
              fundamental importance of RNA processing reactions,most are                    
              not well-understood biochemically.  In particular, little is                   
              known about these processes in  the nuclei and organelles of                   
              higher plants.  Here this focus is on the key reactions of                     
              transfer RNA processing; formation of mature 5' termini by                     
              the endonuclease ribonuclease P, and formation of mature                       
              3'termini by as yet uncharacterized endonuclease(s).  RNase                    
              Ps previously described from eubacteria yeast and vertebrates                  
              have an RNA component.  In the eubacterial enzymes, this RNA                   
              is the catalytic subunit, whereas its role in nuclear enzymes                  
              is unknown.  Surprisingly, RNase Ps from plant nuclei and                      
              chloroplasts appears to lack an accessible RNA subunit like                    
              that of eubacteria.  In the studies proposed here, the                         
              physical structure of purified RNase P from plant                              
              chloroplasts and nuclei will be elucidated.  In particular                     
              the presence or absence of any RNA components in these                         
              enzymes will be verified.  To understand how RNase Ps with                     
              different structures accomplish the same reaction.  The basic                  
              features of substrate recognition and catalytic mechanism of                   
              plant RNase Ps and will be compared to them with those                         
              established for eubacterial RNase P.
