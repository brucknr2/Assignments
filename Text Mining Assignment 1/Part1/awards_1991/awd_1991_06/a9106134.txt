Abstract    :
              This research provides for a systematic evaluation of the                      
              distribution and rates of deformation at Merapi volcano over the               
              next two years -- a period during which a significant explosive                
              eruption is considered likely.  Deformation data will be                       
              interpreted in correlation with conventional telemetered seismic               
              data obtained by the Volcanological Survey of Indonesia, and is                
              expected to provide fundamental new information on Merapi                      
              behavior.  An acceleration in the rate of edifice deformation                  
              preceding sector collapse, or of dome extension preceding dome                 
              collapse and generation of nuees ardentes d'avalanche, should be               
              detectable, and may enable tests of the deformation and failure                
              prediction method of Voight (1988a).  Thus, this research will                 
              enable use of Merapi as a natural laboratory to both understand                
              crucial volcano deformational processes, and to test and refine                
              deformation monitoring techniques.
