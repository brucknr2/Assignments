Abstract    :
                   A combination of approaches, viz. theoretical and observa-                
              tional analyses and numerical modeling, are to be used to study a              
              variety of tropical mechanisms and circulation patterns, particu-              
              larly in the Asia-Pacific Monsoon regions. These will include large            
              areas of heating of the tropical atmosphere, easterly waves and                
              tropical cyclones, the globe-girdling narrow belt of equatorial                
              deep and intense convective activity (the Intertropical Convergence            
              Zone, or ITCZ), and the summer monsoon trough over East Asia (Mei-             
              Yu). The purpose is to understand the dynamic and thermodynamic                
              structure of these flow systems, which range from the global to the            
              regional and individual-storm scales. This understanding requires              
              elucidation of the interactions/inter-relationships among them.                
              These linkages are shaped by the underlying mechanisms which                   
              transfer absorbed solar energy from the tropical upper oceans to               
              the atmosphere and ultimately convert it to the energy of motion               
              systems of various sizes and lifetimes. The regions to be studied              
              supply a substantial fraction of the energy put into the planetary             
              atmosphere, and thus exert a major influence on global weather and             
              short and long term global climate.
