Abstract    :
                   The investigators plan to develop HAILFINDER,  a                          
              knowledge-based system for forecasting severe weather in                       
              Northeastern Colorado.  Until recently most knowledge-based                    
              systems have been based on production rules,  frames,  or                      
              various non-standard logics.  A fourth approach is now                         
              emerging which uses hierarchical Bayesian inference and other                  
              related techniques to perform diagnoses,  draw conclusions,                    
              answer questions,  and produce forecasts.  HAILFINDER will be                  
              the first such system designed for a natural science domain.                   
              Its purpose will be to compare the performance of normatively                  
              designed knowledge-based systems with that of rule-based                       
              systems and with expert performance.  The National Oceanic                     
              and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) will collect and                         
              provide extensive weather information and supply the experts                   
              for a competition among systems for forecasting severe                         
              weather that it will conduct in the summer of 1992.                            
                   HAILFINDER's research team is comprised of four                           
              investigators who embody a variety of skills that are well                     
              suited to meeting the needs of this task.  The project has                     
              the potential of using the specific weather application to                     
              yield results of substantial scientific significance.  Even                    
              if only partially successful,  it promises to provide a more                   
              solid footing for the use of probabilistic expert systems as                   
              practical tools.
