Abstract    :
              This project studies pneumococcal transformation, a naturally                  
              occurring, inducible gene replacement mechanism that is relatively             
              simple and very efficient.  Competence for genetic transformation              
              in pneumococcus (Streptococcus pneumonia) occurs during a brief                
              period of highly specialized protein synthesis, coordinated among              
              all cells of an actively growing culture.  During a period of                  
              approximately 10-20 minutes, the competent cells can transport DNA             
              into the cytoplasm and replace homologous genes in the chromosome              
              very efficiently.  To identify and clone genes involved in this                
              DNA-processing mechanism, and determine their roles, classical                 
              genetic techniques are used, including the efficient gene                      
              replacement provided by the natural transformation process itself,             
              in combination with molecular methods in vitro and recombinant DNA             
              cloning in E. coli, to establish the molecular genetics of the                 
              system.  Gene disruption mutations are made by inserting a drug                
              resistance marker that is expressed both in pneumococcus and in                
              E. coli.  These studies will identify, clone, map, and sequence                
              genes required for synthesis and secretion of a proteins that acts             
              in an intercellular regulatory circuit to control the system                   
              responsible for the temporary differentiation at competence.  They             
              also will characterize other components of the regulatory circuit.
