Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project is a "Scholars Award in Methodological Training for               
              Cultural Anthropologists".  The researcher will receive advanced               
              statistical training to learn techniques appropriate for the                   
              analysis and interpretation of two large datasets.  One is                     
              concerned with the development of sex typing among 192 children                
              aged 3-9 in four agrarian societies.  The second consists of                   
              cross-cultural ratings on the couvade, a custom in primitive                   
              societies where a father's behavior imitates some aspect of a                  
              mother's pregnancy/child-birth experience.  Both datasets are                  
              related to the expression of sex typing, particularly among                    
              males, and will analyze factors that dampen or heighten the                    
              degree of behavior and sociocultural differentiation between the               
              sexes.  The grant will allow extensive statistical tutelage by                 
              faculty at the University of California-Irvine.                                
                                                                                             
              This project is important because it increases the quantitative                
              expertise of a productive socio-cultural anthropologist.                       
              Cultural anthropology has not been known for quantitative                      
              methods, and the National Science Foundation instituted this                   
              funding opportunity to allow scholars to increase their research               
              abilities.
