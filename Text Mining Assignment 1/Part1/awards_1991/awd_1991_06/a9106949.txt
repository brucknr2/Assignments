Abstract    :
              Classical SIMD associative processors execute arithmetic in a bit-             
              serial word-parallel manner.  Current massively parallel machines              
              also perform bit-serial arithmetic in a fine grain computing                   
              environment.  This bit-serial property is a limiting factor in                 
              increasing processing speeds.  A simple but powerful new                       
              architecture based on the classical associative processor model is             
              proposed here.  By distributing logic among slices of storage cells            
              such that a number of bit-planes share a simple logic unit, bit-               
              parallel arithmetic in a massively parallel environment becomes                
              feasible.  For m-bit operands, complex operations such as                      
              multiplications execute in O(m) cycle as opposed to O(m2) for bit-             
              serial machines.  The simplicity of the architecture enables its               
              implementation using VLSI technology, and hence allows the                     
              construction of a word-Parallel, bit-Parallel, massively Parallel              
              (P3) computing system.                                                         
              The main goal of the proposed work is to build an experimental P3              
              machine which is to be embedded into a heterogeneous supercomputing            
              environment.  The need for such architecture and for an actual                 
              working prototype stems from a number of applications which cannot             
              be solved in conventional spercomputers.  In this proposal, space              
              science applications are outlined as this work is also supported               
              by NASA.
