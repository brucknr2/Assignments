Abstract    :
                   This award provides matching funds for the acquisition of a               
              thermal ionization mass spectrometer to be installed and operated              
              in the Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences at              
              the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. MIT is committed to                 
              providing the remaining funds needed for this acquisition.                     
                   The spectrometer system will allow the earth crustal structure            
              and tectonics research group at MIT to pursue geochronological and             
              other isotope geochemical research projects aimed at understanding             
              the evolution of the continental crust and lithosphere.
