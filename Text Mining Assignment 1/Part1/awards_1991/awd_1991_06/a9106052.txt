Abstract    :
                   This theoretical research will be conducted to understand                 
              the role of magnetic fields and current systems in solar flares,               
              and to understand the interaction of plasma flows with radiation               
              in both the chromosphere and corona of flares and active regions.              
              Specifically, this effort will further develop an analytic                     
              description of magnetic reconnection at an X-type neutral point,               
              and extend the studies to numerical simulation; study the                      
              influence of gas pressure on photospheric magnetic fields as                   
              inferred from vector magnetograms; use active region magnetic                  
              field models to determine cross-sectional area variation along                 
              coronal loops for use in hydrodynamic and particle studies;                    
              improve a model for the evolution of the gradual phase of flares,              
              which reduces the complex hydrodynamic description to a simple                 
              ordinary differential equation, making simulations of the entire               
              flare feasible; apply similar techniques to studies of thermal                 
              stability of active region loops; and develop a new, simpler;                  
              faster, radiation-hydrodynamics code for studies of the impulsive              
              chromospheric flare. These problems will be studied with analytic              
              and numerical techniques applied to the gasdynamic, radiation                  
              transfer, and magnetohydrodynamic equations.  This work will aid               
              in interpreting spectroscopic data and vector magnetograms from                
              ground based optical telescopes during MAX '91. ***
