Abstract    :
                   The principal investigators will study a number of                        
              asymptotic problems for linear and nonlinear partial differential              
              equations (PDE's) and systems of PDE's using their connections                 
              with Markov processes.  Such topics as motion of wave fronts,                  
              impulses and other structures in semilinear parabolic systems,                 
              coupled elliptic and parabolic equations with small diffusivity                
              will be considered.  From a probabilistic point of view the                    
              results will be of the averaging principle type or of central                  
              limit theorem and large deviation type for the corresponding                   
              random processes.  The investigators also will study random                    
              perturbations of evolutionary PDE's.  The investigators plan to                
              develop a theory similar to the theory of random perturbations of              
              finite dimensional systems.  Many kinds of limit theorems for the              
              random fields defined by the perturbed PDE's will be considered.               
                   The principal investigators will study a number of                        
              asymptotic problems for linear and nonlinear partial differential              
              equations (PDE's) and systems of PDE's using their connections                 
              with Markov processes.  This work brings together two fields of                
              mathematical research, partial differential equations and                      
              probability theory.
