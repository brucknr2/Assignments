Abstract    :
              This group Research Opportunity Award grant, supported by the                  
              Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the Chemistry                      
              Division, seeks to encourage research in undergraduate                         
              institutions by attracting faculty to a combination research                   
              and classroom summer program.  Having learned broadly of new                   
              analytical science and technology from the classroom work, and                 
              having done forefront research in the various research groups                  
              at North Carolina, the undergraduate faculty will return to                    
              their home institutions, to foster undergraduate research there.

              This program is one of three group Research Opportunity Award                  
              grants supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry                       
              Program in the Chemistry Division.  It is unique in its                        
              combination of classroom lectures with research participation.                 
              Combined classroom and research work seeks to broaden the                      
              general understanding of teachers from small 4-year                            
              institutions, as well as to catalyze their increased                           
              involvement in research.
