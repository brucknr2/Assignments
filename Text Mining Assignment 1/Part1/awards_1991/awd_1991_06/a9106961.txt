Abstract    :
                 Professor Fleming Crim is supported by a grant from the                     
              Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to observe bimolecular                 
              reactions of highly vibrationally excited polyatomic molecules                 
              and to exploit the special nature of these states to directly                  
              control the course of chemical reactions. The object is to                     
              develop and test out schemes to control bond breaking in larger                
              molecules and to make fully quantum-state-resolved measurements                
              which can be compared with theoretical dynamical calculations.                 
              The essence of the technique is to excite an isolated vibration                
              in a polyatomic molecule and to turn that vibration into a                     
              reaction coordinate by a collision with a reactive atom such as                
              H or O.  Reactions to be studied involve HCN, acetylene,                       
              ammonia, methane, propane, and methanol, using techniques such                 
              as stimulated emission pumping and laser-induced-fluorescence                  
              at vacuum ultraviolet wavelengths.

              In this research the course of a chemical reaction between a                   
              polyatomic molecule and an atom is directly controlled by                      
              making use of vibrational excitation, based on the fact that                   
              the geometry change that occurs in going from reactants to                     
              products requires the stretching and breaking of bonds.                        
              Reactions involving collisions of energized molecules are                      
              central in atmospheric chemistry, combustion, and plasmas.
