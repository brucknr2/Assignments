Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The primary objective of this US-Czechoslovak Cooperative                      
              research project between Dr. William Kelly of University                       
              of Nebraska and Dr. Stanislav Mares of Charles University,                     
              Prague is to extend the quantitative capabilities of                           
              surface geoelectrics for estimating aquifer transport                          
              properties.  The researchers plan 1) to establish                              
              appropriate geoelectrical models for transport measure-                        
              ments; 2) to test the models to see to what resolution                         
              transport properties can be determined by direct current                       
              surface geoelectrical methods; and 3) to test the                              
              methodology on an actual field site.  An appropriate                           
              combination of methods will be employed including                              
              profiling, sounding, mise-a-la-masse, and buried                               
              electrode.  The researchers' efforts are expected to                           
              develop a methodology that could be used to combine                            
              data from geoelectrical measurements with measurements                         
              from production wells to determine the properties of                           
              aquifers for evaluation of wellhead areas and the                              
              transport properties from measurements of pollution                            
              movement.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              This project in aquifer transport properties fulfills                          
              the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge                        
              by enabling leading experts in the United States and                           
              Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and pool                       
              research resources in areas of strong mutual interest                          
              and competence.
