Abstract    :
              The Department of Applied and Computational Mathematics at                     
              Princeton University will purchase a high-speed communication                  
              channel which will be dedicated to support research in the                     
              mathematical sciences.  The equipment will be used for                         
              computational hydrodynamics and computational turbulence studies.
