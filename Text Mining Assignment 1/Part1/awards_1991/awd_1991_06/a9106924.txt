Abstract    :
              The University of California - Los Angeles will coordinate                     
              a multidisciplinary workshop to bring together, for the                        
              very first time, biologists, mathematicians, engineers,                        
              geologists, and computer animation specialists who work                        
              with three-dimensional pattern formation and models of                         
              aggregation.  Examples of three-dimensional aggregations                       
              include fish schools, insect swarms, and molecules within a                    
              crystal.  Aggregation is a pervasive behavioral phenomenon                     
              within most animal taxa.  Gaining knowledge about density,                     
              cohesion, and spacing and movements of individuals within                      
              three-dimensional groups has been hampered by the visual                       
              complexity of these aggregations and the lack of tools and                     
              techniques to analyze interactions within them.  Three-                        
              dimensional aggregations are also of interest in several                       
              non-biological disciplines as well.  The workshop will                         
              bring together thirty investigators from various disci-                        
              plines and computer specialists to present information on                      
              their individual research interests, and to explore whether                    
              tools and techniques from other fields can be used to                          
              develop new cross-disciplinary collaboration to advance the                    
              study of aggregations.  Results of the workshop will be                        
              broadly available and form the foundation for future                           
              research.
