Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The proposed research program deals with fundamental questions                 
              regarding unfolding transitions in proteins and the interaction                
              of specific ligands with proteins.  The work will focus on two                 
              proteins, nuclease A and trp aporepressor, and certain site-                   
              directed mutants of these proteins.  Dr. Eftink will study the                 
              cold (as well as high temperature) unfolding and pressure                      
              unfolding of relatively unstable mutants of nuclease.  The goal                
              is to evaluate and correlate various thermodynamic parameters                  
              for the unfolding of several mutants of nuclease in order to                   
              better understand the forces responsible for stabilizing                       
              proteins.  The "structure" and dynamic characteristics of the                  
              various unfolding states (i.e., produced by low and high                       
              temperature, pressure, urea, low pH) will be studied by a                      
              combination of several techniques, including i) time-resolved                  
              fluorescence anisotropy to measure local motion (of the single                 
              trp residue), ii) resonance energy transfer between sites to                   
              obtain intramolecular distance information, iii) size exclusion                
              chromatography to measure the overall hydrodynamic radius of                   
              the molecule, and iv) CD to observe any differences ins                        
              secondary structure.  In addition to comparing the various                     
              unfolded states, the effect of the destabilizing mutations on the              
              folded state of the proteins will be studied by some of the                    
              above methods and by v) room temperature phosphorescence to                    
              compare the rigidity of the environment of the trp residue, and                
              vi) titration microcalorimetry to measure thermodynamic                        
              parameters for the binding of specific ligands to the protein.
