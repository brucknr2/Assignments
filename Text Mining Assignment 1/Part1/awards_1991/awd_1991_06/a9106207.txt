Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will study the relationship between            
              a phase-type distribution and its representations.  A phase-type               
              distribution is the distribution of a hitting time in a finite                 
              state Markov chain.  The central questions are as follows.  For a              
              given phase-type distribution, (a) find its order, and (b) find a              
              minimal representation of it.  Related goals are to study special              
              representations, and to find bounds on order base qualitative                  
              information about a distribution.  Techniques to be used in this               
              study are collectively called the "invariant polytope approach".               
              This research will have relevance to the study of queueing systems.
