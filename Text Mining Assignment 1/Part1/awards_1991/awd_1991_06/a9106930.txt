Abstract    :
                   Bumblebees are perhaps the most important of all pollinators              
              of plants in the Arctic.  Their ability to perform at low air                  
              temperature is based on their remarkable ability to produce heat               
              by shivering and to keep warm in order to remain active.  But                  
              shivering only affects the thoracic muscles that drive the                     
              wings.  The abdomen, which contains no heat-producing tissues,                 
              remains cold unless heat is shunted to that area from the                      
              exercising flight muscles.                                                     
                   In order to reproduce and live in the Arctic, the bees must               
              squeeze their entire life cycle into a single, short summer.  For              
              them, time is temperature; to accelerate egg production and                    
              development rates they must also keep the eggs warm.  The                      
              investigators plan to  examine the hypothesis that Arctic                      
              bumblebee queens "incubate" their eggs not only after they are                 
              laid, but also while they are still developing in the abdomen.                 
              The energy cost of this heat production is likely very high.  But              
              it must be met because of the time constraint.  This                           
              investigation will help determine the importance of temperature                
              regulation in the evolution of the unique life history of the                  
              bumblebee and will further elucidate one of the many patterns of               
              adaptation employed by animals in the harsh, yet fragile Arctic                
              environment.
