Abstract    :
                   An International Conference on Spin and Isospin in                        
              Nuclear Interactions will be held at the Telluride Conference                  
              Center, Telluride, Colorado, on March 11-15, 1991.  The                        
              subject matter will cover new results from major US, Canadian,                 
              and European intermediate energy nuclear physics user                          
              facilities on a variety of subjects, including:  effective                     
              nucleon-nucleon interactions, Gamow-Teller excitations, charge                 
              and spin exchange reactions with pions and nucleons,                           
              polarization studies with high energy leptons, polarimetry                     
              techniques, neutrino physics, and astrophysics.  The meeting                   
              is fifth in a triennial series.
