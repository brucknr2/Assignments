Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The research will evaluate the overloads and ultimate load on a 1/3            
              scale model of a shell-type bridge structure which was previously              
              analyzed and evaluated on a smaller scale model.                               
                                                                                             
              The analytical study will be verified and further analysis on                  
              several other cross-sections will be investigated for comparison               
              of load carrying capacity and economic consideration.
