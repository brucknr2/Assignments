Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research program continues work in a                                      
              second phase evaluation of the performance                                     
              and safety of buildings designed according to                                  
              the recent provisions recommended by the                                       
              Uniform Building Code (UBC) and the                                            
              Structural Engineering Association of                                          
              California (SEAOC).                                                            
                                                                                             
              Research will concentrate on sensitivity of                                    
              risk to uncertainty in structural resistance,                                  
              in particular the contribution of                                              
              nonstructural components; appraisal of                                         
              current code procedures; and development of                                    
              alternative procedures for more risk                                           
              consistent design.  Additional building                                        
              types, i.e., eccentric braced frame and dual                                   
              frame systems, will be studied.  Based on the                                  
              results of the risk study, the Rw factors for                                  
              different building types will be carefully                                     
              examined and if needed alternative values of                                   
              Rw will be commended which are more                                            
              consistent with safety required for different                                  
              building types.  Also, design procedures will                                  
              be developed which provide a given amount of                                   
              damage control through drift limitation.                                       
                                                                                             
              Knowledge to be gained in the seismic                                          
              behavior or representative building types,                                     
              cladding, and nonstructural elements to be                                     
              studied will be most positive.  Results are                                    
              anticipated to have an important impact on                                     
              building code development.
