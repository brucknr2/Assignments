Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              In January 1988 a seismic tomography experiment was carried out                
              on the East Pacific Rise at 9 degrees 30'N to image in three                   
              dimensions the seismic velocity structure of the rise axis. This               
              experiment yielded a seismic data set consisting of more that                  
              8000 records from approximately 500 shots and 15 ocean bottom                  
              seismometers. Initial result from the tomographic inversion of P               
              wave delay times indicate substantial heterogeneity in structure               
              both across and along the rise axis; for instance, the axial low               
              velocity anomaly at 2 km depth is 1.5km/s slower than off axis;                
              the along-axis variations in this velocity anomaly exceed 20%                  
              This renewal will continue the investigation of seismic velocity               
              models using improved inversion techniques, will explore methods               
              of utilizing wave form amplitude information to constrain further              
              the 3-D seismic structure, and will analyze and interpret the                  
              gravity, magnetic, and microearthquake data obtained during                    
              thecourse of the tomograph experiment.
