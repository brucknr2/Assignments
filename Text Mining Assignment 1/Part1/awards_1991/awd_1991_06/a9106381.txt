Abstract    :
                   This project will carry out work related to relativistic                  
              theories of nuclear physics.  The role of vacuum polarization in               
              nuclear ground state correlations will be studied.  A new                      
              approach to renormalization will be investigated.  It is also                  
              proposed to study nucleon-nucleon interactions within a deformed               
              chiral soliton model.
