Abstract    :
                   This award supports the research of Professor J. Beck to work             
              in combinatorics.  He intends to find an algorithmic version of the            
              local Lovasz lemma and if so, to apply this result to various                  
              problems in graph theory and combinatorics.                                    
                   The research is in the general area of combinatorics.                     
              Combinatorics attempts to find efficient methods to study how                  
              discrete collections of objects can be organized.  And, so it is               
              extremely important to modern communications, for example the                  
              design of large networks as in telephone systems and the design of             
              algorithms in computer science.
