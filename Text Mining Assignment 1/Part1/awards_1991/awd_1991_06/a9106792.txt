Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The primary aim of this research is to develop a comprehensive                 
              atomic-level understanding of the chemical reactivity and reaction             
              mechanism associated with the intercalation process.  Scanning                 
              tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy will be used in combination with             
              dynamic high-resolution transmission electron microscopy for                   
              imaging early events in the intercalation chemistry of selected                
              model reactions.  In short, the fundamental questions of how and               
              why intercalation occurs are addressed to enable synthesis of                  
              technologically important materials by design.
