Abstract    :
              The School of Mathematics of the Institute for Advanced Study will             
              purchase six Sparc-2 work-stations, one with graphics capacity, and            
              one Sun server to support research in three projects.  The major               
              project is in computational fluid dynamics and will entail                     
              numerical work in, at least, the following domains: high resolution            
              methods for compressible and incompressible flow; vortex methods;              
              combustion; fast summation methods; wavelets; real-space                       
              renormalization in the context of vortex methods; turbulence                   
              theory; the dynamics of superfluids.  In addition there are smaller            
              projects in computational number theory and in percolation theory.
