Abstract    :
                   Certain plants exude organic sulfides through their roots.                
              In their pure state, many of these sulfides have bacteriostatic,               
              fungicidal, nematicidal, and insecticidal properties.  It is not               
              known whether plants emit sufficient amounts of the sulfides to                
              have these effects in natural systems.  The P.I.'s will                        
              investigate the phylogenetic distribution of these compounds and               
              determine whether their production has effects on the plant                    
              community.  If plants do incorporate sulfides into their overall               
              response repertoire, the effect could be substantial and an                    
              understanding of the phenomenon could significantly alter future               
              investigations of community and ecosystem relationships.
