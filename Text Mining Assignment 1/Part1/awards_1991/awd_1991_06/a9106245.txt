Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The objective of this project is to learn more about the structure,            
              function and regulation of enzymes in pea nuclei that are                      
              stimulated by phytochrome.  Phytochrome stimulates the activity of             
              nucleoside triphosphatase (NTPase) in purified pea nuclei, and                 
              calcium ions are necessary for this response.  A calmodulin-                   
              dependent 47 kD NTPase has been isolated from pea nuclei and shown             
              to have properties that implicate it as being the nuclear NTPase               
              that is regulated by phytochrome.  This NTPase appears to be                   
              closely related to a lamin-derived 46 kD NTPase in mammalian                   
              nuclei, whose activity is thought to be important for RNA export               
              from nuclei.  Additional sequence information on the plant NTPase              
              will be obtained to confirm or disprove this relationship.  There              
              is some evidence that the phosphorylation of lamins in animal                  
              nuclei plays a critical role in its controlled degradation by                  
              proteolysis.  The phosphorylation of the pea NTPase will be                    
              characterized, and its role both in the regulation of NTPase                   
              activity and in the production of NTPase from lamin-like precursors            
              will be examined.  The results should contribute to an improved                
              understanding of how light can influence nuclear metabolism, with              
              possible implications also for models of how light regulates plant             
              gene expression.//
