Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The goal of this research is to understand how the seed controls               
              pericarp (pod) elongation in the pea Pisium sativum, where it is               
              known that the seed is a rich source of giberellins which have                 
              positive effects on pod elongation.  This study aims to confirm                
              that pericarp growth is dependent upon giberellin biosynthesis in              
              situ, to determine whether seeds, or application of another                    
              hormone, auxin, regulate in vivo pericarp giberellin-19 oxidase                
              activity and relate the level of enzyme activity to pericarp                   
              growth, to investigate the mechanism of action of seed and auxin               
              stimulation to giberellin biosynthesis, and to identify the seed               
              factor which promotes pericarp growth and giberellin biosynthesis              
              in the pericarp.  Experimental approaches to these studies will                
              involve use of radiolabelled giberellin precursors and                         
              intermediates and metabolite purification by HPLC and analysis by              
              GC-MS.
