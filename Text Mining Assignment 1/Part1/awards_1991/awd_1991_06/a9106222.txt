Abstract    :
                   This project is concerned with the construction of the                    
              quantum analogs of enveloping algebras, their representation                   
              theory, and solutions to the quantum Yang-Baxter equation on                   
              representation spaces.  The principal investigator will use a                  
              module theoretic approach to the quantum Yang-Baxter equation.                 
              Particular emphasis will be given to classifying solutions in the              
              2-dimensional case.  The class of finite dimensional                           
              quasitriangular Hopf algebras will also be studied with attention              
              given to categorical constructions.                                            
                   Quantum groups are a new area of research for both                        
              mathematicians and physicists.  On the mathematical side, it                   
              combines three of the oldest areas of "pure" mathematics,                      
              algebra, analysis and geometry, yet it is of great interest to                 
              physicists working in conformal quantum field theory.
