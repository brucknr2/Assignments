Abstract    :
                   Professor Ye will study evolution equations and applications              
              to problems in Riemannian geometry. In particular he will study                
              the Ricci flow, the Yamabe flow, and the harmonic mapping flow.                
              The method of evolution equations has become an important method               
              for finding critical points of geometric functionals and in                    
              understanding the dynamic structure of space.                                  
                   The evolution equations to be studied in this research can                
              be understood physically by imagining a stretched rubber band                  
              immersed in a viscous fluid such as oil. The evolution equation                
              for this example then describes the way in which the rubber band               
              shrinks. The speed at which it shrinks at any point on the band                
              is proportional to how much the band is curved at that point.                  
              Since so many physical problems involve deformation of curves or               
              surfaces, the potential for application of this research is                    
              substantial.
