Abstract    :
                   An enigmatic limestone breccia in the Guilmette Formation of              
              southeastern Nevada will be investigated.  The Guilmette Formation             
              spans the Late Devonian Frasnian-Famennian stage boundary.  The                
              breccia is exposed in seven ranges over at least 5000 square miles             
              and has known thicknesses ranging from 25 to 435 feet; it                      
              encompasses a volume of 100 cubic miles or more.                               
                   The breccia appears to be a single sedimentary carbonate bed              
              not tectonically, diagenetically, or solution-derived.  It has a               
              sharp, scoured base, and contains haphazardly oriented,                        
              lithologically heterogeneous clasts that fine-upward.  Some clasts             
              reach 50 feet or more in longest dimension.  The breccia occurs in             
              a shallow-water marine setting, based on characteristics of                    
              overlying and underlying beds.  It suggests catastrophic origin,               
              perhaps related to an extraterrestrial object impacting Earth.                 
                   The breccia and its significance will be investigated through:            
              stratigraphic analysis of overlying and underlying beds to refine              
              its paleogeographic setting; characterization of its internal                  
              properties to determine provenance, transporting and depositing                
              mechanisms, and to test the single-event hypothesis; narrowing its             
              age designation through closer biostratigraphic zonation; searching            
              for links to possible extraterrestrial genesis, e.g., shocked                  
              quartz, geochemical anomalies, etc.
