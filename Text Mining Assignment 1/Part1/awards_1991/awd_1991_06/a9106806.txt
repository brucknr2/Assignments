Abstract    :
                   Ophiolitic rocks in the Coast Ranges of California show many              
              similarities to modern ophiolitic forearcs such as in the Marianas,            
              where large-scale normal faults cause catastrophic landsliding into            
              the trench and there are giant serpentinite mud volcanoes.                     
              Observed processes in modern ophiolitic forearcs suggest that large            
              volumes of oceanic material can be transferred from the forearc                
              into the subduction complex and from the subducting plate into                 
              forearc.  This study will examine the Mesozoic ophiolitic rocks in             
              the Coast Ranges and compare them to rocks in the Mariana forearc              
              to better understand the processes of formation and modification               
              of forearc crust.  The results of this work will have importance               
              for tectonic processes in subduction zones.
