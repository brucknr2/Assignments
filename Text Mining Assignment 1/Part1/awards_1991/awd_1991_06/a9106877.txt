Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              Higher organisms are dependent on precise cell to cell                         
              communication.  Cells communicate via specific receptors on their              
              surfaces.  One important receptor system in that for gonadotropin              
              releasing hormone (GnRH).  This receptor is found in the pituitary             
              gland at the base of the brain and controls, among other things,               
              the timing of the menstrual cycle.  An important, but incompletely             
              understood aspect of this cell to cell communication, concerns the             
              factors that control the number of receptors present on the cell.              
              If there are more receptors, the cell will manifest a greater                  
              response.  However, until recently, studying the synthesis of the              
              GnRH receptor has been difficult.  A variety of new techniques now             
              makes study of this area possible.  The planned research will use              
              a combination of approaches, including molecular biology and                   
              electrophysiology, to measure the level of the gene products for               
              the GnRH receptor in the cell and to investigate how that level is             
              controlled.  This will provide valuable information about the                  
              regulation of the amount of this receptor as well as other similar             
              receptors.//
