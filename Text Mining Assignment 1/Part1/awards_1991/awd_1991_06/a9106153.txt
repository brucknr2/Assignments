Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Changes in energy supply require societal adjustments.  It is             
              important to understand the nature of those adjustments and what               
              potential contribution changes in household energy-use behavior can make       
              in the face of an impending energy shortfall.  This doctoral                   
              dissertation project will study two Swedish towns that are dependent           
              upon different energy sources as they comply with the result of a              
              national referendum issued by the Swedish government to phase out the          
              country's nuclear reactors.  Historical and theoretical analysis and           
              empirical research involving focus groups, telephone questionnaires, and       
              a mass media analysis will be used to illuminate the positions of those        
              groups that were involved in the nuclear referendum debate and to assess       
              the potential for household energy-conservation programs.                      
                                                                                             
                   This project will provide information valuable both to the                
              scientific community and to policy makers about how grassroots behavior        
              can lead to an acceptance of difficult economic tradeoffs in the               
              interest of environmental management.  This project also will provide an       
              excellent opportunity for a promising young scholar to continue to             
              develop independent research skills.
