Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research process and performance consequences of changes in               
              various aspects of work groups.  It builds upon and is an                      
              extension of a continuing program of research on time in group                 
              interaction and performance.  The studies will make use of two                 
              major products of earlier work in that program:  A theory of work              
              in groups (called Time, Interaction and Performance, of TIP,                   
              theory), and a time-oriented system for analysis of interaction                
              process in work groups (called Time-by-Event-by-Member Pattern                 
              Observation system, or TEMPO).  TIP theory predicts a number of                
              important consequences for group process and outcomes, of changes              
              in group membership, changes in group tasks, and changes in the                
              circumstances under which the group is operating.  TEMPO provides              
              a method for testing many of the predictions about process                     
              changes.  A new set of techniques, called "process replay", will               
              be developed and used to explore the situated meanings of acts                 
              within group process and relate those meanings to the main                     
              concepts of TIP theory.
