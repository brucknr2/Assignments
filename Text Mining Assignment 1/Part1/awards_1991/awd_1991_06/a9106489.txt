Abstract    :
                   The hypothesis to be tested is that blue-green algae                      
              (Cyanobacteria) will in general be found to be more efficient in               
              using CO2 than will most non blue-green algae, thus leading to                 
              blue-green dominance when pH is high and CO2 is low.  The                      
              hypothesis will be tested during a whole growing season in two                 
              lakes using + and - enrichments with CO2 by changing pH.  The                  
              experiments will be evaluated by measuring CO2 uptake with 14C                 
              microautoradiography.
