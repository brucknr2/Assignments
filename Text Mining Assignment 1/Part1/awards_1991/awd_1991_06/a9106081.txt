Abstract    :
                      This research is concerned with the Kazdhan-Lusztig theory.            
              This involves Kac-Moody Lie algebras and groups, their                         
              representations and the combinatorics of Bruhat ordering on Coxeter            
              groups.  The principal investigator will study the combinatorics of            
              Bruhat ordering, the geometry of Schubert varieties, and highest               
              weight representations of Kac- Moody Lie algebras.                             
                      This project is in the general area of Lie algebra.  The               
              principal investigator is concerned with the Kazhdan-Lusztig                   
              polynomials which are combinatorially defined objects having deep              
              connections with structures in geometry and representation theory.             
              This work is important in both mathematics and physics.
