Abstract    :
              With this Grant for Exploratory Research from the Physical                     
              Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Davis                   
              will study the dissociation and addition reactions of C60,                     
              called buckminsterfullerene or fullerite, accelerated to high                  
              relative translational energies in a crossed supersonic beam                   
              apparatus.  The dynamics of C60 by itself, in a Van der Waals                  
              cluster, or with adsorbed metal atoms will be studied for the                  
              effects that substituents produce.  Collisions with different                  
              target molecules will also be investigated.

              Since the discovery of the molecule C60 (buckminsterfullerene                  
              or fullerite), chemists have wondered about the physical and                   
              chemical properties of this soccer ball-shaped molecule, since,                
              because of its high symmetry, it is expected to be unusually                   
              stable with respect to chemical reaction.  A recently disclosed                
              method for making large quantities of C60 allows this unique                   
              species to be studied by a wide variety of techniques.  This                   
              current study will help to answer a large number of questions                  
              about the properties of fullerite in particular and will help                  
              form a basis for understanding fullerenes in general.
