Abstract    :
              In this project, PI's from three institutions will carry out                   
              sampling on a transect in the Southern Ocean along 65 degrees                  
              South latitude across the Ross Sea.  The sampling will be carried              
              out on the USSR vessel, R/V IOFFE.  Scientists from Oregon State               
              University will provide overall coordination and contribute to                 
              the overall data analysis and integration, while scientists from               
              Lamont-Doherty will acquire and analyze samples for the tracers,               
              Tritium, Helium, Oxygen-18, and Carbon-14.  The Scripps                        
              Institution of Oceanography (this project) will be responsible                 
              for hydrography and nutrients.  This section constitutes a joint               
              contribution by the USA and the Soviet Union to the International              
              World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE), specifically,                       
              Hydrographic line S-4.
