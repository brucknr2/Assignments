Abstract    :
                The objective of this proposal is to expand research                         
              capabilities and opportunities in physiology, including                        
              neuroscience, at Meharry Medical College.  This expansion                      
              will center on a multifaceted research and training program                    
              organized along the theme of cellular communication.  The                      
              proposed research-centered program will focus on fundamental                   
              questions associated with communication within and among                       
              cells.  The proposed program aims to accomplish the                            
              following:  1) To enhance the development of a core                            
              neurochemistry laboratory equipped to handle such                              
              neurochemical procedures as cellular/subcellular                               
              fractionations and in vivo sampling, neuroactive substance                     
              delivery, and sensitive quantitative analysis; 2) To                           
              contribute to the improvement of a research environment                        
              conducive to effective collaborative interactions; and 3) To                   
              provide additional training opportunities for minority                         
              graduate students and postdoctoral fellows.  Four detailed                     
              projects are presented as core cellular communication                          
              projects.  These core projects will be heavily served by the                   
              expanded core neurochemistry laboratory.  Additional brief                     
              project descriptions are included as further examples of                       
              research to be served by the expanded core neurochemistry                      
              laboratory.
