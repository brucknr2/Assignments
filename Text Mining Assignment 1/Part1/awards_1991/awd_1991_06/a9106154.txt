Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Light exerts enormous effects on phototrophic organisms in addition            
              to providing the energy for their activities; the object of this               
              project is to elucidate the signal transduction pathway between the            
              initial perception of light by the cyanobacterium and the resultant            
              changes in gene expression that have effects on the components of              
              the light-harvesting complexes as well as morphological traits.                
              Freymella diplosiphon will be examined in terms of global responses            
              to changes in light quality and specific molecular requirments of              
              the light-regulated responses, using physiological, biochemical,               
              as well as molecular genetic approaches.
