Abstract    :
                   This project undertakes research on numerical methods for                 
              parameter estimation in distributed parameter systems.  Several                
              important topics are addressed.  Parameter estimation problems                 
              are typically formulated as optimization problems, which are                   
              solved using gradient methods.  The first topic is the efficient               
              computation of gradients using costate methods coupled with                    
              time-Galerkin methods.  The second topic is the choice of                      
              regularization (i.e., stabilization) parameters in the                         
              optimization formulation.  Related to this is the topic of                     
              choosing system inputs and observations to maximize information                
              content.                                                                       
                   These numerical methods are used to develop computer models               
              that describe ion flow in instruments used in analytical                       
              chemistry.  These techniques may also be applied to a broad range              
              of disciplines that use mathematical models to describe similar                
              phenomena.  Examples include the modelling of flow through porous              
              media, which has important applications in the cleanup of                      
              polluted groundwater and in enhanced oil recovery.
