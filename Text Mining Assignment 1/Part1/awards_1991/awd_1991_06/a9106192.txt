Abstract    :
                   This project is concerned with the automorphism groups of                 
              partially ordered sets which are highly homogeneous.  The                      
              principal investigators will focus on freeness and high                        
              transitivity of almost all subgroups, the representation of free               
              products with amalgamation as highly transitive subgroups, and                 
              maximal subgroups.  They will also explore the automorphism group              
              of the real line.                                                              
                   A group is an algebraic object having a multiplication                    
              defined on it.  Groups occur naturally in many areas of                        
              mathematics, physics and chemistry.  Every finite group can be                 
              embedded in a group of permutations.  This project is concerned                
              with infinite permutation groups.  It involves group theory,                   
              logic and combinatorics.  There are also possible connections                  
              with computer science.
