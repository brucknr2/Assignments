Abstract    :
                   This research addresses the excitement generated in the                   
              field of cosmic ray physics by reports of point sources of Ultra               
              High Energy (UHE) gamma rays detected by conventional sea level                
              Extensive Air Shower (EAS) arrays.  The investigator plans the                 
              completion of construction (already 25% complete) of an array                  
              using a new concept involving position sensitive detectors which,              
              it is claimed, provides superior angular resolution of one                     
              quarter of a degree by directly measuring individual angles of                 
              the charged secondaries in the air showers.  This array (GRAND)                
              would consist of 64 stations (with 10 complete in December 1990)               
              over a 100 meter by 100 meter area.  Each station consists of                  
              eight planes, with area 1.25 square meters, of position sensitive              
              detectors spaced vertically.  The bottom two planes are separated              
              from the top six by a thin steel absorber used to distinguish                  
              muons from electrons or soft secondary photons.  Crucial features              
              of the planned array then are smaller angular resolution                       
              (reducing background by a factor of nine relative to other                     
              comparable arrays) and muon, electron and soft photon                          
              identification.
