Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The University of Washington will operate the R/Vs                        
              CLIFFORDA. BARNES and THOMAS G. THOMPSON during 1991 as general                
              purpose oceanographic vessels in support of NSF-funded research                
              projects. The R/V BARNES is a 65 foot general research vessel                  
              built in 1966, the R/V THOMPSON is a 274 foot general research                 
              vessel built in 1991. The BARNES is owned by the National Science              
              Foundation and operated by the University of Washington through a              
              charter party agreement with NSF. The THOMPSON is owned by the                 
              Navy and operated by the University of Washington through a                    
              charter party agreement with the Office of Naval Research.                     
                                                                                             
                   These vessels are part of a fleet used by the National                    
              Science Foundation to support oceanographic research projects.                 
              Most oceanographic requires highly specialized equipment and                   
              extensive support from the ship's crew. An increasing number of                
              research projects require specialized equipment installed on the               
              vessel and for which the ship has been specially designed. Such                
              equipment requires highly specialized crew members for operation               
              and maintenance. The vessels do not operate in the same manner as              
              commercial cargo or fishing vessels, therefore NSF supports the                
              operation of a variety of vessels specifically dedicated to                    
              oceanographic research. These vessels are operated by                          
              universities and research institutions around the country.                     
                                                                                             
              The R/V BARNES operates primarily in the coastal waters of the                 
              northwest U.S. The R/V THOMPSON will operated as an all oceans                 
              vessel and will be operating out of foreign ports as required by               
              cruises. These vessels are capable platforms for these                         
              operations, and the University of Washington has maintained an                 
              excellent program at modest costs.
