Abstract    :
                   A user mode research program will be carried out in                       
              nuclear structure studies with electron scattering and charge                  
              exchange reactions.  This work will be carried out at the                      
              Bates linac and at IUCF.  Some effort will also be dedicated                   
              towards experiment development at CEBAF.  Improved                             
              understanding of nuclear structure and effective interactions                  
              is sought.  Data will be compared to theories including large                  
              basis shell model calculations.  Simulations, detector                         
              development, data analysis, interpretation, and other related                  
              activities will be carried out at Kent State University.
