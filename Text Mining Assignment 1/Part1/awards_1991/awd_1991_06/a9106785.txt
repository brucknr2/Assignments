Abstract    :
                   Several frameworks have been applied to organization of                   
              communities under natural selection.  Of these, the concept of                 
              Evolutionarily Stable Strategies (ESS) provides a powerful                     
              framework evaluating the consequences of density-dependent and                 
              frequency-dependent selection within and among species.  Here,                 
              the ESS concept will be applied to the investigation of three                  
              evolutionary scenarios relevant to natural selection's influence               
              on properties of communities: 1) predator-prey coevolution, 2)                 
              evolution of habitat and diet selection, and 3) evolution in                   
              spatially heterogeneous environments.  The predator-prey model                 
              breaks the traditional dichotomy between the coevolution of                    
              competitors and the coevolution of predator-prey by permitting                 
              coevolution among species within and between trophic levels.                   
              Habitat selection as an evolutionary game considers the                        
              prevalent role of habitat and diet partitioning in promoting the               
              evolution and coexistence of competitors.  In all three                        
              scenarios, the emphasis is on determining evolutionary and                     
              ecological properties of communities that promote or inhibit                   
              species diversity.
