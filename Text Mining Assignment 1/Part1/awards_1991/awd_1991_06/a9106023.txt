Abstract    :
                   The Greater Caucasus Mountain Range is a rapidly rising                   
              mountain belt driven by the collision of the Iranian-Turkish and               
              Arabian continental blocks with the Russian craton.  In cooperation            
              with Soviet colleagues a number of problems bearing on the tectonic            
              evolution of the northern Tethys ocean margin, the involvement of              
              the Russian craton in active margin processes have been identified.            
              These have significance for widely- applicable processes of intra-             
              sialic rifting, the irregular response to deformation of irregular             
              shapes of collisional blocks and in the recycling of                           
              compositionally heterogeneous basement nappes into new sialic crust            
              by superposed batholithic magmatism.  The work will focus on the               
              structural setting and isotope geochemistry of the Chegem River                
              Caldera and related rocks and possible relationships to the                    
              transcaucasus structural zone, U/Pb zircons geochronology of                   
              previously collected samples from the Bechasin, Fore Range and Main            
              Range basement zones and the age and tectonic setting of the Kasbek            
              diabase belt and related intrusions along the southern boundary                
              zone.  Results are expected to increase knowledge of sialic crustal            
              genesis, mesozoic intra-sialic rifting and the neotectonic regime              
              of this area.
