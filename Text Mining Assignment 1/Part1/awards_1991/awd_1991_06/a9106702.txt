Abstract    :
              This grant, jointly funded by the Analytical and Surface                       
              Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division and by the                         
              Instrumentation and Instrument Development Division in                         
              Biological and Behavioral Sciences, will further the                           
              development of ion trap mass spectrometry for sequencing                       
              biopolymers.  Instrumentation for determination of polypeptide                 
              molecular weight and fragment molecular weight will be enhanced                
              to that point that proteins up to MW 100,000 can be sequenced,                 
              even when only a few femtomoles are available.  Novel operating                
              modes of the ion trap to allow selective viewing of a reduced                  
              mass range at enhanced resolution will be developed.                           
                                                                                             
              %%%                                                                            
                                                                                             
              This grant renews support of research in instrumentation for                   
              sequencing of such biopolymers as DNA and proteins.  Novel ion                 
              trap mass spectrometer configurations will be employed for                     
              sequencing species with molecular weights  up to 100,000.                      
              Potential applications include structural elucidation of                       
              enzymes, identification of mutations, and sequencing of                        
              glycoproteins (proteins bound to carbohydrate chains).
