Abstract    :
                   The accurate forecasting of the form of precipitation in                  
              wintertime storms (e.g. rain, snow, freezing rain) is a                        
              challenging problem with potentially great societal benefit.                   
                                                                                             
                   The Principal Investigator will investigate the factors that              
              determine precipitation form and its impact on the structure of                
              the parent storm.  The study will include a climatological                     
              effort, diagnostic and numerical modeling studies.  Particular                 
              emphasis will be placed on the study of snow that falls at                     
              temperatures above zero degrees centigrade.  Such storms cause                 
              great damage and present forecasters with formidable problems.
