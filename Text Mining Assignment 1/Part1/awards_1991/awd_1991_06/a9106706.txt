Abstract    :
                   Estimation of the mean vector and the covariance matrix for               
              multivariate data is an extensive practice.  The investigation is              
              aimed at studying properties of estimators which are robust                    
              against contamination of long tailed distributions.                            
                   The study will investigate the breakdown properties of M-                 
              and S-estimates,along with projection-based estimates. A study of              
              the properties will determine their suitability in real life                   
              applications.
