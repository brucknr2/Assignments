Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal is focused upon the biodegradation/conversion of the             
              lignocellulose and lignin, and related plant materials (humus), by             
              termites that are rendered able to do this by virtue of their gut              
              microbiota (bacteria, protozoa).  The studies will include basic               
              microbiological characterization of those organisms that can be                
              cultivated, study of their biochemistry and physiology, and                    
              assessment of their molecular biological traits.  The aim of the               
              studies is to elucidate fundamental, functional interactions not               
              only between bacterial and protozoal species, but with their                   
              termite hosts as well.  The studies will be significant not only               
              in the biological realm, but in understanding aspects of the global            
              carbon cycle and global warming, as well.//
