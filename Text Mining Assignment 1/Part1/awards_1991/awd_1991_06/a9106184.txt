Abstract    :
              In this project, the PI will continue the operation of an office,              
              established in 1989, to coordinate the International World Ocean               
              Circulation Experiment (WOCE) Hydrographic Programme (WHP) and to              
              provide quality control for all WOCE Hydrographic data.                        
              Hydrographic data from WOCE cruises will be obtained from                      
              individual PI's, submitted for quality control, archived, and                  
              submitted to the WHP Special Assembly Center (SAC) in Hamburg,                 
              Germany.  The director will oversee a number of external data                  
              quality experts (DQE), from countries participating in the WHP.                
              Priorities will be determined in relation to terms of reference                
              revised at a meeting of the WHP Planning Committee in October,
