Abstract    :
              This research will exploit a unique developmental system in which              
              isolated mesophyll cells differentiate synchronously to form                   
              tracheary elements.  Tracheary elements are characterized by                   
              distinctly patterned secondary walls, but it is not known how                  
              wall deposition and patterning are controlled.  Prior results                  
              demonstrated requirements for calcium sequestration and transport              
              before and during wall deposition, thereby providing the first                 
              evidence for a regulatory ion the might coordinate diverse events              
              in cell wall deposition.  These and other results will be                      
              extended in three directions: (1) Determination of which events                
              in wall deposition are regulated by calcium; (2) Determination of              
              how wall patterning is controlled, particularly in regard to                   
              self-determining interactions of wall components; and (3)                      
              Characterization of a plasma membrane associated protein                       
              associated with cell wall patterning.  The research will use                   
              modern cytochemical, spectroscopic, and molecular biological                   
              techniques for molecular dissection of cell wall structure and                 
              control of patterning.  It will represent the first attempt to                 
              obtain a molecular understanding of the temporal and spatial                   
              control of synthesis of cell wall tracheary elements, which are                
              classical specimens in plant developmental biology and have a                  
              significant role in plant adaptation.
