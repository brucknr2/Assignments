Abstract    :
                   When streams in tropical rain forests flood, their fish                   
              populations often swim into the adjacent forests, in some cases                
              for dozens of miles.  Fish species that feed on tropical fruits                
              may then disperse seeds over large areas beyond the normal stream              
              boundaries.  Previous studies have revealed that fish of the                   
              genus Brycon are major components of this seed dispersal system.               
              Accordingly, the P.I. proposes to investigate the diet of Brycon,              
              and particularly the use of figs, and the nature and degree of                 
              seed dispersal into forest next to tropical streams in Costa                   
              Rica.  The study will provide important insights into an unknown               
              component of the maintenance of tree diversity and community                   
              structure in tropical rain forests.
