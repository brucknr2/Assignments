Abstract    :
              The Third International Congress of Plant Molecular Biology will               
              be held October 6-11, 1991 in Tucson, Arizona. The previous                    
              meetings were highly successful in bringing together plant                     
              scientists from throughout the world. This projected meeting                   
              promises to be even more exciting and thus probably even more truly            
              global.***
