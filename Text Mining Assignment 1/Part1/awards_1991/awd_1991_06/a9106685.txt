Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The heliobacteria, a newly discovered family of non-oxygen                     
              evolving photosynthetic bacteria, have a reaction center that                  
              is broadly similar to Photosystem I of oxygen evolving                         
              organisms.  The goal of this project is to develop the                         
              heliobacteria as a bacterial model for Photosystem I in the                    
              same way that the purple photosynthetic bacterial have been                    
              very successfully used as a model for Photosystem II.  Dr.                     
              Blankenship isolated the reaction center from Heliobacillus                    
              mobilis in an active form,, and is characterizing its chemical                 
              and physical properties using a variety of techniques.                         
                                                                                             
              Preliminary femtosecond absorption difference spectra suggest                  
              that a 670 nm absorbing species is not the primary electron                    
              acceptor in the heliobacteria, in contrast to reports from                     
              other laboratories.  Experiments are proposed to identify the                  
              chemical nature of the primary acceptor.  Redox titrations                     
              indicate that a species that undergoes two electron reduction                  
              under some conditions is an early acceptor.  This species is                   
              probably a menaquinone, analogous to the phylloquinone acceptor                
              A1 in Photosystem I. Experiments are proposed to characterize                  
              this acceptor, as well as subsequent Fe-S protein acceptors.                   
              The properties of the membrane-bound cytochrome that acts as                   
              electron donor to the reaction center will also be                             
              investigated.
