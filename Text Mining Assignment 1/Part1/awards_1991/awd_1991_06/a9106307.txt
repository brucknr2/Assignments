Abstract    :
                   Professor Haydn will study dynamical systems using a local                
              entropy function.  There are three areas where this concept will be            
              applied.  First, Professor Haydn will use it to find a formula                 
              which determines the Hausdorff dimension of a hyperbolic set.                  
              Second, he will use it to find the singularity spectrum of for                 
              higher dimensional dynamical systems.  Finally, a somewhat finer               
              tool will be used to investigate escape rates for non-attractors.              
                   A dynamical system can be thought of as a system which evolves            
              in time with a definite well defined law.  For example, given the              
              initial state of a fluid, at least theoretically one can use the               
              Navier-Stokes equations to predict the state of the fluid at any               
              later time.  However, this evolution is so complicated, even                   
              chaotic, that one must look for general ways of describing the                 
              evolution without actually solving the equations.  This is the                 
              realm of the field of dynamical systems and the driving force                  
              behind the research of Professor Haydn.
