Abstract    :
              This experimental program will employ Positron annihilation induced            
              Auger Electron Spectroscopy (PAES) for the study of surfaces and               
              the Auger process itself.  The exising UTA magnetically guided PAES            
              system will be used to identify directly the elemental content of              
              the top-most atomic layer and to obtain Auger spectra with                     
              extremely low energy dose rates.  Systems to be studied include (1)            
              the growth and interdiffusion of ultrathin metal films composed of             
              iron, neodymium and palladium on copper, (2) adsorbates on metal               
              surfaces, (3) suface segregation in alloys, and (4) fragile                    
              adsorbed layers and chemically unstable systems including organic              
              molecules on catalytic surfaces and conducting polymers.  Future               
              modifications of the positron beam will make possible a new form of            
              polarized Auger spectroscopy for use in the study of magnetic                  
              systems in which the polarization of the initial hole rather than              
              the outgoing electron is selected.
