Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Because different astrophysical processes show characteristic                  
              emission at different wavelengths, astronomers seek many different             
              wavelength windows to the universe.  The difficulty of making                  
              infrared observations from typical optical observatories led NASA              
              to construct a 3-meter dedicated telescope on the summit of Mauna              
              Kea, Hawaii in the mid-1970's.  NASA decided, however, that half               
              the total observing time would satisfy its needs, and allocated the            
              other half to visitors.                                                        
                                                                                             
              The National Science Foundation has provided funds to support these            
              visitors since the opening of the telescope in 1979.  While the                
              NASA observers examine objects related in some way to NASA space               
              missions, the visitors are free to observe any object of sufficient            
              scientific interest, whether in or out of our Galaxy.  The modest              
              amount of money is used for accommodations, local transportation,              
              cryogen (to cool the telescopes), and publication in the scientific            
              journals.  The success and diversity of the program fully justify              
              its continued funding.
