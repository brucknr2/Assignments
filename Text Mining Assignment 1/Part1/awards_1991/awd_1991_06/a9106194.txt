Abstract    :
                   This award supports the research of Professor J. Rogawski to              
              work in automorphic functions.  He intends to work on the relations            
              between L-packets and theta liftings for unitary groups.  He                   
              intends to first study the quasi-split unitary group U(3) and then             
              try to extend these results to general unitary groups.                         
                   Modular forms arose out of Non-Euclidean geometry in the                  
              middle of the nineteenth century.  Both mathematicians and                     
              physicists have thus long realized that many objects of fundamental            
              importance are non-Euclidean in their basic nature.  This field is             
              principally concerned with questions about the whole numbers, but              
              in its use of geometry and analysis, it retains connection to its              
              historical roots and thus to problems in areas as diverse as gauge             
              theory in theoretical physics and coding theory in information                 
              theory.
