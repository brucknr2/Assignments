Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project seeks to achieve a fundamental understanding of                   
              surface reactions and related processes during selective silicon               
              epitaxy by chemical vapor deposition.  Experiments will make use of            
              a low pressure, high temperature emission chemical vapor deposition            
              infrared cell, a variable angle attenuatated total reflectance                 
              cell, and Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy.  In situ                    
              emission experiments are designed to provide new information on the            
              role of surface species such as hydrides, chlorides and oxides on              
              silicon substrates under epitaxial growth conditions.  New                     
              qualitative and quantitative understanding of fundamental processes            
              important to surface science, and having technological relevance to            
              the microelectronics industry is expected.
