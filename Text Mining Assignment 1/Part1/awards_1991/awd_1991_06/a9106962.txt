Abstract    :
              This award supports a delegation of chemists from U.S.                         
              universities to Hungary to get acquainted with the research                    
              activities in chemistry in Hungarian universities.  The purpose                
              of the visit is to pinpoint areas and topics for enhanced                      
              interaction between U.S. chemists and their Hungarian                          
              colleagues for the mutual benefit of chemistry in both                         
              countries.  This is a research planning grant which involves a                 
              report to the Foundation shortly after completion of the trip.                 
              The report will be widely circulated to other government                       
              agencies as a means to expedite interactions between the U.S.                  
              and Hungary chemists.
