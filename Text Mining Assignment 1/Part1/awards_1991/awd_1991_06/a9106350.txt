Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal addresses the interactions between nuclearly and                 
              mitochondrially encoded proteins by study of the function of a                 
              novel protein--localized in yeast mitochrondria--that is essential             
              for complex III of the electron transport chain.  This nuclearly               
              encoded protein (CBP4) is not a component of the respiratory chain             
              but is essential for an active enzyme complex in vivo.  The effects            
              of this protein on the import into the mitochrondrion of complex               
              III subunits, more rapid turnover of the subunits, subunit-binding             
              to CBP4, and the relative kinetics of CBP4 and complex III subunit             
              syntheses during de novo protein synthesis will be among the foci              
              of the research.  Use of a suppressor mutant strain should aid the             
              analyses of the functional role of CBP4 and/or other proteins that             
              may be shown to have a role in regulation of respiratory function.
