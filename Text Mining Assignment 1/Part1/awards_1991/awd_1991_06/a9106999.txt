Abstract    :
                   The proposed work will examine locomotory muscle power in                 
              living organisms and apply the findings to extinct reptiles                    
              (particularly pterosaurs, but results will be applicable also to               
              dinosaurs).  Preliminary work by the PI has suggested that some                
              living reptiles possess high-power muscle fibers capable of                    
              generating (during "burst-level" activity) twice the weight-                   
              specific contractile power of avian or mammalian muscles.  Since               
              reptiles traditionally have been considered inferior to endothermic            
              birds and mammals with regard to physiology and locomotion, this               
              observation is remarkable.  The PI now proposes to extend                      
              measurement of locomotory muscle power capacity to a variety of                
              extant reptiles to determine the generality of his earlier                     
              observations.  He will then apply the results to reinterpret the               
              nature of powered flight in pterosaurs.
