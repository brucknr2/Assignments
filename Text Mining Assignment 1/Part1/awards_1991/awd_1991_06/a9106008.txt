Abstract    :
              Homothallism in the unicellular alga, Chlamydomonas monoica is an              
              example of intracellular decision-making: individual cells derived             
              from a common progenitor become cells of compatible mating-types               
              (mt+ or mt-).  Our goal is to decipher the genetic mechanisms                  
              underlying this simple binary cellular decision-a type of decision             
              central to developmental biology.  Our objectives are three-fold:              
              1) to distinguish between regulatory mating-type loci (mt) and loci            
              under mating type regulation (mtl), 2) to identify genes (swi)                 
              controlling the cell's ability to choose between alternative mating            
              phenotypes, and 3) to determine whether genes involved in DNA                  
              repair/recombination also contribute to homothallism.                          
                                                                                             
              During the development of any organism to an adult stage,                      
              innumerable decisions are made.  The hope of understanding the                 
              mechanisms related to such decision making can only be realized by             
              studying the simpler binary decision making process in an organism             
              such as Chlamydomonas.***
