Abstract    :
                   Semiparametric models incorporate both parametric (finite-                
              dimensional) components and nonparametric (infinite-dimensional)               
              components.  Proportional hazards models for single observations               
              or for linked observations are examples; other models for                      
              partially censored data also lead to models of this type. This                 
              research will develop efficient estimators and will address the                
              problem of testing hypotheses about the parametric portions of                 
              these models.
