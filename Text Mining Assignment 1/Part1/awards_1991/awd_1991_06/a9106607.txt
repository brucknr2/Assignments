Abstract    :
              The specific objectives of this proposal are (1) to develop a                  
              unified software program which will optimize the sensitivity and               
              spatial resolution of computer-controlled acquisition and                      
              analysis of electron probe x-ray spectral data from biological                 
              thin sections, and (2) to increase productivity by making the                  
              quantitative analysis portion of the program readily available to              
              each participating investigator, who will then be able to process              
              her/his data off-line on an inexpensive microcomputer.  The                    
              software development goals of this project are (1) to provide and              
              develop quantitative imaging techniques for electron probe                     
              information and (2) to provide and develop multi-user imaging and              
              database facilities which are totally compatible with image                    
              information from other (non-electron) sources, such as light                   
              microscopy, which are used for microchemical imaging.  These                   
              specific objectives and goals are motivated by the biological                  
              goal of determining how structural and ionic compartmentation                  
              relates to the mechanisms involved in maintaining intracellular                
              ionic homeostasis in a variety of cell and tissue types.
