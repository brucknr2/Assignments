Abstract    :
                   The principal investigators study the approximation of the                
              spectrum of singular self-adjoint Sturm-Liouville problems by                  
              regular Sturm-Liouville problems.  They focus efforts on the                   
              conjecture that any point in the spectrum of a singular problem                
              is the limit of a sequence of eigenvalues of a family of regular               
              problems, and on its computational consequences.  A major part of              
              the effort is devoted to development of SLEIGN2, a successor to                
              the SLEIGN code for computing eigenvalues of Sturm-Liouville                   
              problems.                                                                      
                   Sturm-Liouville problems arise in transport theory, quantum               
              physics, quantum chemistry, geophysics, and acoustics.                         
              Computation of their solutions is important.  Where the problem                
              is regular, several software codes are available to help                       
              calculate solutions. This project undertakes to create software                
              for singular problems.
