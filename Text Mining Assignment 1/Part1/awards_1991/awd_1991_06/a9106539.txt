Abstract    :
              In this project, the PI will deploy about 50 RAFOS floats and an               
              associated tracking network in the western North Pacific to study              
              the subsurface circulation during 1992-1995.  The majority of                  
              these floats will be deployed at a depth of 1000 meters, with the              
              remainder at a depth of 3000 meters.  Most of these floats will                
              fulfil, in part, the requirements for the World Ocean Circulation              
              Experiment (WOCE) in the western North Pacific, while all will be              
              in collaboration with a Navy (Naval Oceanographic and Atmospheric              
              Research Laboratory) effort in the same region to study western                
              boundary currents in addition to the general circulation in the                
              region.
