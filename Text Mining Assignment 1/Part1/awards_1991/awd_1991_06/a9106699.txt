Abstract    :
              Studies of the mechanisms of organometallic reactions will be                  
              continued. Concerted organometallic reactions will be examined                 
              in which elementary steps that would otherwise generate high                   
              energy intermediates with vacant coordination sites combine                    
              with steps that consume vacant coordination sites. The                         
              stereochemistry of addition of hydrogen chloride to rhenium                    
              carbene complexes and the rearrangements of the alkyl chloro                   
              rhenium products will be carefully studied. The synthesis and                  
              reactions of unusual metal-metal double-bonded compounds will                  
              will be explored.  Studies of hydrocarbyl bridged diiron                       
              compounds, which have proven useful in carbon-carbon                           
              bond-forming processes, will be continued.  The mechanism of an                
              unusual photochemical dehydrogenation of a m-alkylidene diiron                 
              complex will receive special attention.

              In this project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organo-                    
              metallic Program of the Chemistry Division, Dr. Charles Casey                  
              of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, will continue studies                 
              of the mechanisms of organometallic reactions.  These studies                  
              will have application to homogeneous catalysis and the                         
              synthesis of new and useful compounds.
