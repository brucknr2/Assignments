Abstract    :
                   This award describes the proposed involvement of the                      
              investigator in a collaboration with nine universities and                     
              Fermilab in an experiment to measure and analyze the                           
              scattering of photons from quarks.  The result will be a                       
              measurement of the distribution of momenta of quarks and                       
              gluons residing in nuclei and a study of their transition to                   
              observable particles.  The investigator and his undergraduate                  
              and Master's thesis students plan to continue an already                       
              ongoing role in the running of the experiment during the                       
              present year, and also in the analysis of the data during the                  
              ensuing two years.
