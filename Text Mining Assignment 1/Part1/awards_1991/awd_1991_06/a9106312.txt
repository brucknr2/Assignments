Abstract    :
              Since about 1985, extremely efficient and                                      
              nonconservative methods have been developed                                    
              for the analysis of robust stability of control                                
              systems subject to parameter variations.                                       
              However, there are no synthesis procedures                                     
              available at all.  On the other hand, H-infinity                               
              control theory has a well-developed synthesis                                  
              procedure.  This theory, however, is highly                                    
              conservative when applied to the parametric                                    
              stability problem.  In this proposal we intend                                 
              to develop synthesis procedures for control                                    
              problems containing parameter uncertainty.  A                                  
              promising opening is given by recent results                                   
              (obtained by the PI's) proving that the                                        
              extremal stability margins (including H-infinity                               
              margins) occur on certain manifolds derived                                    
              from Kharitonov's theorem.  This link suggests                                 
              that H-infinity (and other classical synthesis                                 
              methods) might be intelligently tailored to give                               
              nonconservative synthesis procedures for                                       
              parameter variation problems.  This will form                                  
              the main area of our research.  We expect the                                  
              results of this research project to have an                                    
              impact on the analysis and design of control                                   
              systems arising in many applications.
