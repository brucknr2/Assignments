Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Membrane damage in the form of lipid peroxidation may mediate the              
              cytotoxic effects of many photoactivatable dyes and pigments                   
              (photodynamic sensitizers).  Lipid hydroperoxides (LOOHs) generated            
              by sensitized photooxidation of unsaturated phospholipids and                  
              cholesterol have numerous adverse effects on membrane structure and            
              function.  Many aspects of photoperoxidation are still poorly                  
              understood at the molecular and cellular level, including (a)                  
              relative reactivity of different lipid classes and how this is                 
              modulated; and (b) enzymatic detoxification reactions, specifically            
              those involving selenium and glutathione.  Building on past                    
              experience in membrane photooxidation, this project will address               
              each of these questions in comprehensive fashion, progressing form             
              studies on model systems (liposomal membranes, erythrocyte ghosts)             
              to the cellular domain (cultured leukemia and endothelial cells).              
              A variety of biologically relevant sensitizers (porphyrins,                    
              phthalocyanines) and state-of-the-art analytical techniques                    
              (clonogenic survival assays, liquid chromatography with                        
              radiochemical and electrochemical detection) will be used.  These              
              studies are timely and relevant in view of (a) the rapid                       
              development of practical new approaches that exploit photodynamic              
              effects (e.g. phototherapies), and (b) the growing risks of                    
              environmental toxicity.//
