Abstract    :
              With support from the Organic Dynamics Program, Dr. Parker will                
              obtain detailed fundamental knowledge of the factors that                      
              determine the reactivity of organic radical ions and doubly                    
              charged ions in solution. His approach utilizes relationships                  
              developed for isodesmic reactions to obtain thermodynamic data                 
              for a variety of reactions directly from reversible electrode                  
              potential measurements. The thermodynamic data thereby obtained                
              will permit prediction of bond dissociation energies and can be                
              used to suggest new reactions that are based upon knowledge of                 
              relative bond strengths in radical ions and doubly charged ions.               
              %%%                                                                            
              Organic radical ions are reactive species that possess an                      
              unpaired electron in addition to an electronic charge. Dr.                     
              Parker has developed a method that will permit bond dissocia-                  
              tion energies in these species and in doubly charged ions to be                
              determined. This, in turn, will provide a data base for                        
              determining the energetics of a variety of reactions that                      
              proceed via intermediate radical ions and doubly charged ions.                 
              The information thereby obtained will provide fundamental new                  
              knowledge that is likely to lead to improved understanding of                  
              the chemistry of these reactive intermediates.
