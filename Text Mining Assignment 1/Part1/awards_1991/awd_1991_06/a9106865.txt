Abstract    :
              The principal objective of this study is the elucidation of                    
              the relationships between nucleation and growth processes, on                  
              the one hand, and the fundamental chemical processes of                        
              hydrolysis and condensation, on the other hand, in the sol-gel                 
              production of binary glasses and ceramics.  Understanding of                   
              this relationship is necessary to produce the desired                          
              homogeneity, bulk structures, and phase distributions in                       
              complex ceramics and glasses.  A systematic study of the                       
              effects of formulation and processing of binary glasses via                    
              the sol-gel process is conducted.  Several in situ techniques                  
              including infrared, Raman, and nuclear magnetic resonance                      
              spectroscopies are used to examine chemical kinetics, chemical                 
              transformations, and solid-state structures.  The physical                     
              evolution of the sol nuclei and the gel structure are followed                 
              with dynamic light scattering and dynamic  viscoelastic                        
              experiments of the evolving gel.                                               
                                                                                             
              The sol-gel process is a very important new technology for the                 
              production of high-performance glasses and ceramics.                           
              Applications of binary glasses and ceramics are found in many                  
              high-technology systems, including optical systems as fiber                    
              optics and light guides, chemical systems as catalysts and                     
              adsorbents, and electronic systems as dielectric and                           
              ferroelectric.
