Abstract    :
              The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is valuable for studies             
              of gene expression because of its ease of culture and amenability              
              to classical and molecular genetic studies.  A genetically                     
              engineered inducible Ty transposable element, containing a                     
              functional HIS3 gene, it used to obtain insertion mutations in                 
              suitable yeast strains.  The insertions are identified in genetic              
              analysis by the ability of cells to grow without added histidine               
              (the His+ phenotype).  Isolated DNA carrying an insertion hybridize            
              to radioactive probes of the HIS3 sequences.  We plan to improve               
              procedures for obtaining mutants with single Ty insertions and for             
              demonstrating linkage of the His+ phenotype with the mutant                    
              phenotype.  Undergraduate research assistants at Allegany Community            
              College are assisting in developing a method for screening large               
              numbers of mutants by selection of a random sample of spores.  We              
              have obtained 2 types of mutations: (1) activation of a silent gene            
              which alters the control of mating type, resulting in sterility,               
              and (2) disruption of an essential gene, resulting in lethality.               
              I plan to involve students in isolating and characterizing Ty                  
              insertion mutations which disrupt genes essential for growth or for            
              the ability to synthesize specific nutrients, and for mutations                
              which activate other cryptic or silent genes.
