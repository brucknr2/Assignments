Abstract    :
                   The 1991 Theoretical Advanced Study Institute, a summer                   
              school for advanced graduate students of theoretical                           
              elementary particle physics, will be held in June, 1991 at the                 
              University of Colorado in Boulder.  The Institute will focus                   
              on various aspects of the standard model of the elementary                     
              particles and their interactions.  Physics that may lie beyond                 
              the standard model will also be discussed.  The school will be                 
              an improtant part of the advanced training of its attendees.
