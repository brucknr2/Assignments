Abstract    :
              The Arctic Research and Policy Act of 1984 requires the Interagency            
              Arctic Research Policy Committee to prepare a biennial revision to             
              the Arctic Research Plan.  Integral to this revision are statements            
              of accomplishments by federal agencies over the past two years and             
              their plans for the following two years.  This project provides for            
              The Minerals Management Service to convene a meeting of federal                
              scientists to exchange information on recent accomplishments and               
              future plans.  Representatives from some 12 agencies within and                
              outside Alaska are expected to participate.  The meeting will be               
              open to the public.  Results of the workshop will be included both             
              in the Plan's revision and the interagency journal, Arctic Research            
              of the United States.
