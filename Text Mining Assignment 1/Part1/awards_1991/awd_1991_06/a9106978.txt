Abstract    :
                   This project supports a workshop and briefing paper to be                 
              done by the National Academy of Sciences on the research                       
              interface between the mathematical sciences and materials                      
              research.  The briefing paper will be used in planning at the                  
              National Science Foundation and will be distributed to other                   
              Federal agencies and industrial groups that fund research in the               
              mathematical sciences and materials science.                                   
                   The project has particular promise for identifying research               
              opportunities at the interface between the mathematical sciences               
              and materials science.  Materials science applies techniques of                
              chemistry and physics to real materials.  Current research                     
              depends upon correlations that have been arrived at through                    
              exhaustive laboratory experiments and simulations.  Mathematical               
              models of composite materials hold the promise of predicting                   
              strength, flexibility, and electrical resistance of a proposed                 
              composite without conducting extensive testing.
