Abstract    :
                   The Principal Investigator will study possible mechanisms                 
              involved in the formation and spatial distribution of tooth                    
              primordia.  The preliminary model will be closely based on                     
              experimental evidence from alligators  Alligator mississippiensis              
              and the known properties of cells.  The case for the alligator as              
              a model for research in craniofacial development is convincingly               
              made by Ferguson (1981).  In particular the PI's aim to reproduce              
              a specific pattern, namely the positions and initiation sequence               
              of the first seven teeth in the right half lower jaw of the                    
              alligator.  The model will be a quantitative realization of a                  
              caricature of the descriptive model for tooth formation in                     
              Alligator mississippiensis described by Westergaard and Ferguson               
              (1987).                                                                        
                   The mathematical model will involve a system of nonlinear                 
              coupled partial differential equations describing both the                     
              mechanical properties of the epithelial and mesenchymal cells as               
              well as the reaction and diffusion of various chemicals.  Thus,                
              the model will include elements of both the reaction-diffusion                 
              and the mechanochemical approaches to pattern formation, and will              
              incorporate tissue interaction processes.  In the modelling the                
              emphasis will be on the greatest possible biological realism at                
              the expense of mathematical simplicity.
