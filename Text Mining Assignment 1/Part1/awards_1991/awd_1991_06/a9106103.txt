Abstract    :
              Recently, a new technique was developed which utilizes high                    
              intensity electrical pulses to temporarily permeabilize the cell               
              membrane, a process called "electroporation".  With this method,               
              exogenous molecules (including proteins, antibodies and genes)                 
              can be introduced into living cells.  The major objectives of                  
              this research are:  (1) To obtain a better understanding of the                
              basic processes and mechanisms of electroporation.  (2) To                     
              improve the technology electroporation and to develop more widely              
              useful instrumentation.  (3) To develop new applications of                    
              electroporation for research in cell biology, molecular biology,               
              developmental biology and neurobiology.  The technology developed              
              in this laboratory will be made available to other scientists                  
              through the establishment of a collaborative facility located at               
              the Marine Biological Laboratory, Wood Hole, MA.  A number of                  
              collaborative studies using an improved method of electroporation              
              have been planned.
