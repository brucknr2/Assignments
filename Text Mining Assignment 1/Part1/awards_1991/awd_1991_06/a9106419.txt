Abstract    :
              Current performance and reliability modeling techniques and tools are          
              seen to be, by themselves, largely inadequate for obtaining realistic          
              predictions of the behavior of very large scale electronics systems.           
              Numerous authors have experienced difficulties with tractability of            
              large scale models, and have resorted to a variety of specialized, ad          
              hoc techniques.                                                                
                                                                                             
              The focus of this project is the development of a high-level formalism         
              (language) for the specification, composition, decomposition, and              
              solution of large scale performance and reliability models.  It is             
              expected that this formalism for model composition will aid the                
              modeler in assembling models of these large scale systems and in               
              understanding the errors as well as the gain in efficiency achieved by         
              alternative model composition structures.  An automated model                  
              pipefitting system is expected to emerge.
