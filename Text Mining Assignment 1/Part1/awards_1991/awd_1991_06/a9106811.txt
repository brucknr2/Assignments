Abstract    :
              This grant will support a multi-agency workshop                                
              on microelectromechanical systems (MEMS).                                      
              The purpose of the workshop is to introduce                                    
              MEMS to a broad range of Federal agencies,                                     
              and to seek applications of the technology in                                  
              the solution of problems faced by these                                        
              agencies.  Three specific objectives of the                                    
              workshop are (1) to introduce MEMS to                                          
              representatives of several Federal agencies, (2)                               
              to identify MEMS applications relevant to these                                
              agencies, and (3) to provide a high-quality                                    
              report on the status of MEMS technology and                                    
              a prediction of future developments and                                        
              applications.
