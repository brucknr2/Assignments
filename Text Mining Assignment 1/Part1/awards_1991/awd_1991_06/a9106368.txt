Abstract    :
              This project is to develop a model for cooperative work in multi-user          
              rule-based development environments (RBDEs).  RBDEs forma class of             
              environments that assist developers in carrying out the development            
              process.  RBDEs are built on object management systems that abstract           
              project components as objects, representing both product and process.          
              They model the development process in terms of planning system-style           
              rules that act on these objects.  Each rule encapsulates an activity           
              by specifying the condition that must be satisfied to initiate the             
              activity and the effects of completing the activity.  RBDEs maintain           
              object base consistency and automatically carry out some development           
              activities through forward and backward chaining among the rules.              
                                                                                             
              Most existing RBDEs are single-user; those that support multiple               
              users isolate the users, preventing cooperation.  The goal of this             
              project is to scale up RBDEs to assist teams of developers cooperating         
              on large-scale projects.  This cooperation involves: (1) concurrency           
              control; (2) multiple views; (3) evolution; and (4) distribution.              
              These four problems will be solved in the context of the MARVEL RBDE.          
              A single-user version of MARVEL has been completed, and licensed to 11         
              external sites.  Scaling up MARVEL involves solving the four                   
              theoretical problems in addition to engineering the MARVEL                     
              architecture.
