Abstract    :
              The overall objective of this proposal is to characterize                      
              the morphology, structure, geometry, and rheological                           
              properties of two representative hybridoma cell lines in                       
              order to evaluate the effects of well defined hydrodynamic                     
              forces on such cells, and to establish membrane failure                        
              criteria that result in cell damage and cell death.  A                         
              range of experimental techniques (electron, light and                          
              fluorescence microscopy, micropipet manipulation,                              
              rheoscopy, and micro-rheometry) will be used to evaluate                       
              the aforementioned properties, and to determine the                            
              influence of hydrodynamic forces on the cells in simple                        
              (laminar and turbulent) flow, and in complex turbulent                         
              flows that model more closely the fluid environment in                         
              bioreactors.   Mechanisms of membrane and cell damage will                     
              be evaluated by combining experimental measurements with                       
              fluid flow studies and theoretical calculations.   These                       
              studies are essential to improve and/or simplifiy                              
              bioreactor design, and to promote the optimal growth                           
              conditions, for the mass production of monoclonal                              
              antibodies.
