              support for Dr. Subhash C. Goel, of the Civil Engineering                      
              Department at the University of Michigan, to visit Japan to                    
              do an in-depth critical survey of Japanese use of steel                        
              reinforcement for seismic upgrading and strengthening of                       
              existing concrete buildings.  Dr. Goel will spend a month of                   
              his sabbatical leave at the Building Research Institute in                     
              Tsukuba, reviewing relevant Japanese literature and visiting                   
              related Japanese research institutions.
