Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              Little is presently known about the conditions under which                     
              dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is produced or destroyed in                     
              modern oceans or about the role of DOC in the structure and                    
              dynamics of aquatic marine microbial ecosystems.  The objective                
              in this research is to develop a mass spectrometric method for                 
              shipboard determination of carbon-isotopic compositions of                     
              organisms constituting the marine microbial food web.                          
              Availability of such techniques should facilitate large-scale                  
              studies of the origin and recycling of DOC.  DOC is the largest                
              organic carbon reservoir in seawater and, accordingly, is                      
              particularly important in the global carbon isotopes, high-                    
              temperature catalytic combustion techniques for the                            
              determination of the abundance of DOC, flow cytometry for the                  
              separation of individual cell types and experimental growth of                 
              mixed bacterial populations.
