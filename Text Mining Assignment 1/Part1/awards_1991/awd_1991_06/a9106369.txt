Abstract    :
                   The genus Dasymutilla (Hymenoptera: Mutillidae) is a                      
              relatively large group of parasitic wasps distributed predominantly            
              in North America.  There has not been an extensive study of the                
              genus since 1928, and even that study dealt only with species                  
              inhabiting America North of Mexico.  Less than half of the species             
              belonging to this genus are known from both sexes.                             
                   The overall objectives of this study are to complete a                    
              taxonomic revision of the genus Dasymutilla, including correlation             
              of the sexes of more species, updating of biological and                       
              distributional data, providing current keys to the species for both            
              males and females, and phylogenetic analysis.  The specific goals              
              to be accomplished through the funding of this project are: 1)                 
              visit appropriate museums and university collections in order to               
              examine the holotype specimens of the genus Dasymutilla; 2) study              
              the general collections of Dasymutilla in museums and universities,            
              noting geographic distribution, dates of collection, and looking               
              for specimens taken in copula; and 3) visit as many known                      
              collection sites as possible, collecting specimens and biological              
              data, especially for species for which key taxonomic data are                  
              lacking.
