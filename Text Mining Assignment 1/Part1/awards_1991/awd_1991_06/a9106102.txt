Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is a peptide hormone,                    
              originally identified in the brain.  Data has shown that it may be             
              produced by the human placenta and may regulate human chorionic                
              gonadotropin (hCG), which regulates the production of progesterone,            
              which is required for the early maintenance of pregnancy.  Studies             
              will examine placental GnRH production and its effect on the                   
              production of the hCG.  An understanding of this relationship is               
              central to an understanding of the ability of the placenta to                  
              regulate its own growth and development, as well as that of the                
              child.  Approximately ten percent of all infertility is                        
              unexplained, some portion of which may be due to spontaneous                   
              abortions due to an inadequate hormonal environment.  It is                    
              therefore apparent that a better understanding of the hormonal                 
              requirements for the maintenance of pregnancy are required.//
