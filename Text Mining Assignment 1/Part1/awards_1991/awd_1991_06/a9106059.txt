Abstract    :
              The Institute for Algebra and Combinatorics at the University of               
              California, Santa Barbara will purchase equipment which will be                
              dedicated to the support of research in the mathematical                       
              sciences.  The equipment will be used for several research                     
              projects, including in particular: numerical solution of partial               
              differential equations, algebraic geometry and three manifolds,                
              polynomial invariants and the combinatorial classification of                  
              knots and links, and three-dimensional incompressible swirling                 
              flows.
