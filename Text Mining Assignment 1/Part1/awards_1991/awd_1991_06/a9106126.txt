Abstract    :
              Etter         A stochastic filter consists of a bank of fixed filters with  a
              set of corresponding probabilities.  The fixed filters from a  basis set of
              filters for the stochastic filter, and the  probabilities determine the
              specific realization represented by  the stochastic filter.  This research is
              investigating the use of a stochastic filter to  adaptively model an Infinite
              Impulse Response (IIR) system.   Guidelines for selecting the basic set of
              filters are being  developed in order to represent an adaptive IIR filter and
              to  meet both accuracy and convergence speed constraints.
