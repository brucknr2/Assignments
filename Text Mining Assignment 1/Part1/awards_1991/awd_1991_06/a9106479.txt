Abstract    :
                   For the Schrodinger operator, the effective geometry for                  
              spectral considerations consists of the distribution of resonant               
              wells and is controlled by the pseudo-Riemannian metric of Jacobi              
              and Agmon.  The effective geometry for the wave equation is                    
              determined by the shape of the obstacle and the boundary                       
              conditions.  The effective geometry for the hyperbolic manifold is             
              determined by the Poincare metric.  In each of these cases, this               
              research will examine how the spectral data reflects the trapping              
              or non-trapping property of the potential or the capacity of the               
              metric to trap geodesics.  A goal of this research is the                      
              derivation of the trace formulas which express geometric properties            
              of the manifold in terms of the spectral data.                                 
                   This research addresses the general question of the interplay             
              of the geometric and spectral properties of non-compact manifolds.             
              First, how does the geometry of the manifold determine the spectral            
              types.  Second, how does the spectral data place constraints on the            
              geometry and topology of the manifold.  Three cases of application             
              are the quantum mechanics of ordered media with electric fields,               
              scattering for the wave equation, and infinite volume hyperbolic               
              manifolds.
