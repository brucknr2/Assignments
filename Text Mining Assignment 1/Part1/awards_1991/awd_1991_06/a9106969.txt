Abstract    :
                   Support is provided for a workshop on the national geomagnetic            
              initiative.  The workshop will address challenges and future                   
              directions in geomagnetic studies, including all aspects of the                
              temporal and spatial variations, from the near earth environment               
              to the earth'score; consider the needs for an ongoing mechanism for            
              future interaction and coordination; and develop a plan of action.
