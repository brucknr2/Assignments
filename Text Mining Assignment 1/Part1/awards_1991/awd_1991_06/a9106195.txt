Abstract    :
                   This project will develop, analyze, and implement algorithms              
              for solving mathematical programming problems.  It is planned to               
              focus on simplex algorithms, interior point algorithms, and                    
              methods that combine them.  The research on simplex algorithms                 
              will be directed towards solving network flow problems including               
              maximum flow, minimum flow, generalized network flow problems,                 
              and multicommodity flow problems. The research on interior point               
              algorithms will concentrate on solving structured linear                       
              programs, exploring large step path-following algorithms, solving              
              nonlinear programming problems.                                                
                   This research will involve theoretical analysis of the                    
              algorithms and their implementation and empirical testing.                     
              Extensive areas of society where operations research is required               
              will benefit from this project.
