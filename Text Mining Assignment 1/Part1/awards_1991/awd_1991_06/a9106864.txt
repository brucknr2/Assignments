Abstract    :
                   It has always been assumed that pollen characters are                     
              determined by the genotype of the plant (from the classic nature-              
              versus-nurture argument, pollen traits are assumed to be totally               
              determined by 'nature').  However, recent experiments have shown               
              that the environment can have important effects on pollen                      
              characters.  For instance, work with wild radish demonstrated                  
              that pollen from plants grown under nutrient-limiting conditions               
              sired fewer seeds than pollen from control plants.  This proposal              
              is centered around measuring the genetic and environmental                     
              contributions to variation in pollen traits in Silene alba, white              
              campion, a common weed in the eastern United States.  The pollen               
              traits are pollen number per flower, pollen size, percent of                   
              pollen that has aborted, and the ability of pollen to sire seeds.              
              Most of the work will consist of documenting how much natural                  
              variation in these traits exists in fields around New Jersey and,              
              through transplant experiments, how the same genotype performs in              
              different environments.  The result will a precise measurement of              
              the genetic and environmental contributions to a variety of                    
              pollen traits, and perhaps to paternity itself.
