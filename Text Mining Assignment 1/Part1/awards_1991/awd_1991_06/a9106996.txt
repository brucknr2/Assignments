Abstract    :
              The objective of this workshop is to provide a forum for                       
              the exchange of views and information, to assess the state                     
              of the art, and to identify research issues and needs in                       
              the area of soil bioengineering systems. Predictive models                     
              accounting for the reinforcing/stabilizing role of roots                       
              and other natural fibrous inclusions in the ground,                            
              durability and long term stability, conjunctive use of                         
              vegetation and synthetic textiles, cost effectiveness                          
              comparisons with conventional systems will be discussed by                     
              leading soil bioengineering practitioners and experts.
