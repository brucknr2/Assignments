Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal seeks partial support for a summer FASEB conference              
              "Ubiquitin and Protein Breakdown" that deals with a topic of                   
              fundamental importance in a wide variety of both pro- and                      
              eukaryotes; the meeting provides a forum at which leading                      
              contributors to research progress on this topic will be able to                
              share latest findings and interact to stimulate research in key,               
              critical areas.
