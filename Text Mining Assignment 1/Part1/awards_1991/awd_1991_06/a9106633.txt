Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project addresses atomic level details of chemical reactions,             
              transport phenomena, and epitaxial crystal growth underlying                   
              metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy(MOVPE) of advanced III-V compound             
              semiconductor structures.  Major emphasis is placed on basic                   
              studies of doping and contaminant processes for improved                       
              understanding and controllability.  A systematic experimental and              
              computer simulation approach is being taken to address these                   
              issues.  Fundamental details of carbon and zinc doping of gallium              
              arsenide during MOVPE as a function of primary epitaxy growth                  
              variables as well as mapping of doping uniformity will be carried              
              out.  MOVPE has become a premier technique for the growth of                   
              compound semiconductors, but the limited uniformity and the control            
              of electrical properties of such material restricts the general                
              applicability of the method and has limited its utilization for                
              advanced electronic and optoelectronic device and circuit                      
              development.  The basic studies being pursued on this project will             
              provide additional fundamental information at the atomic level                 
              critical to the understanding and utilization of MOVPE, and thus,              
              will have important technological benefits to the field of                     
              microelectronics as well as to our basic scientific knowledge base.
