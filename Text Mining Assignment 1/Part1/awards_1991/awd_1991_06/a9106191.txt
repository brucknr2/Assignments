Abstract    :
              In 1990, the Fifth U.S. Conference on gallium-                                 
              arsenide (GaAs) Manufacturing Technology                                       
              (ManTech) was held to provide a forum for the                                  
              exchange of knowledge in GaAs manufacturing                                    
              science and technology relating to electronic and                              
              optoelectronic devices, and high-speed integrated                              
              circuits.  A two-day presentation of technical papers                          
              was held.  For the first time, the 1990 ManTech                                
              Conference was not held in conjunction with the                                
              International GaAs Integrated Circuit (IC)                                     
              Symposium, but instead was structured as a full-                               
              fledged stand-alone conference with a high                                     
              interactive workshop environment.                                              
              Because of the enthusiastic evaluation of the                                  
              Conference by the attendees, the Sixth U.S.                                    
              Conference on GaAs Manufacturing Technology                                    
              has been organized and will again be held                                      
              April 7-10, 1991 in Reno Nevada.  A considerable                               
              expansion of the Conference's scope has been                                   
              authorized by the Executive Committee in response                              
              to widespread suggestions from attendees to include                            
              a vendor exhibition and a special workshop on                                  
              microwave and digital testing.
