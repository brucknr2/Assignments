Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The purpose of this proposal is to study synthesis of the                      
              chlorophyll isocyclic ring.  The proposal specifically seeks to                
              understand the cyclization of Mg-protoporphyrin mono-methyl ester.             
              The enzymological system catalyzing this reaction has two                      
              components, one soluble and one membrane-bound.  This research will            
              seek to isolate and characterize the soluble component.  The aims              
              are the research are to elucidate as far as possible the synthesis             
              of (divinyl) protochlorophyllide at the level of enzyme mechanism,             
              to purify the soluble protein component of the system and thus open            
              the way for analysis of the problem by molecular biology.//
