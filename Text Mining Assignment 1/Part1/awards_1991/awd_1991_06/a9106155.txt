Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This three-year project addresses the need to develop the                      
              architectures and distributed system software in Picture Archiving             
              and Communications Systems (PACS) and Global PACS.  PACS                       
              environments are a sub-class of a much larger class of image                   
              database systems, distributed over a local and national                        
              geographical area.  PACS have been researched since the early                  
              1980's and are currently being developed for use in medical imaging            
              and hospital environments.  In a PACS, the patient information and             
              digital images are generated every time a patient experiences a                
              procedure on a medical imaging equipment, such as an x-ray,                    
              computed tomography (CTSCAN), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)             
              machines.  The information and images are transferred through a                
              high speed network to a database archive system, where the data are            
              later retrieved into the radiologist's high resolution workstation             
              for diagnosis.  In a Global PACS, the data may be transferred                  
              and retrieved across country between PACS and national archive                 
              centers.  In this research project, the existence of local PACS in             
              various hospitals around the country is assumed, and the project is            
              developing the interconnection methods into the NSFNET and the                 
              distributed system software to implement a prototype Global PACS               
              environment.***
