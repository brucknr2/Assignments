Abstract    :
              This award to Dr. Joan S. Valentine of the Chemistry                           
              Department, University of California at Los Angeles, is made by                
              the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program.  It                   
              supports work in three related areas:  model intermediates for                 
              the reactions of non-heme monooxygenase enzymes; organic                       
              cofactors required by dioxygenase enzymes; and the synthesis                   
              and characterization of metalloporphyrin peroxo complexes of                   
              iron and chromium, which may model intermediates in the                        
              activation of dioxygen by heme-containing monooxygenase                        
              enzymes.  In the first area, Dr. Valentine will study the role                 
              of Fe-cyclam and related complexes in olefin epoxidation                       
              reactions with hydrogen peroxide, alkyl hydroperoxides, and                    
              organic peracids.  In the second study, benzolylformate                        
              complexes of iron and tetrahydropterin complexes of iron and                   
              cobalt will be synthesized and investigated.                                   
              %%%                                                                            
              The overall goal of the proposed research is to design                         
              catalysts for oxygenation reactions, and in the process better                 
              understand the mechanism of biological dioxygen and monooxygen                 
              activation.
