Abstract    :
                   This research is the analysis of hybrid random-access systems             
              which use a combination of multi-user coding and collision                     
              resolution algorithms to accommodate the bursty transmissions of               
              many independent users on a single communications channel.  The                
              main idea is to avoid collisions among T or less simultaneous users            
              by the use of multi-user codes and to resolve occasional collisions            
              among more than T users by the use of a collision resolution                   
              algorithm.  A gain in throughput and delay performance can thus be             
              expected if close to T users transmit at the same time, but a                  
              penalty must be paid if only one user transmits because the                    
              symmetric code rate of almost all multi-user codes must be less                
              than one for each individual user. One of the major goals of this              
              research is to determine the properties which a multi-user code                
              must possess such that the use of a hybrid random access system                
              yields better overall performance than an uncoded random access                
              system.
