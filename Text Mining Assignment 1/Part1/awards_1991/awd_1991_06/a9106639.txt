Abstract    :
                   This SGER award is to develop a three-dimensional                         
              electromagnetic particle code which will be capable of processing              
              20 million particles in a 200 by 200 by 200 grid.  In order to                 
              achieve this ambitious goal, new and unique computational                      
              techniques will be introduced which include radiating boundaries               
              local processing of fields, local, filtering and the elimination               
              of Poissons equation and its time consuming solution.                          
              Scientifically, the grant will be used to investigate the                      
              fundamental physical processes associated with plasma clouds                   
              expanding into an ambient magnetized plasma.  This problem is                  
              important for the space plasma applications of the release of                  
              lithium and barium, clouds, galactic plasma jets, and the                      
              interaction of cometary atmospheres with the solar wind.
