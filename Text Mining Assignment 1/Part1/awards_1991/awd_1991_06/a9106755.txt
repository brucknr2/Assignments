Abstract    :
                   To investigate the electrification of clouds near their                   
              tops, the electric field will be measured using three research                 
              aircraft during the Convection/Precipitation/Electrification                   
              Experiment (CaPE) scheduled for Florida during the Summer of                   
              1991.  Also, the persistence of charge in dissipating                          
              thunderstorm clouds will be investigated using the same aircraft               
              and instrumentation.
