Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The hydrogeology of karst, a limestone region marked by sinks and         
              abrupt ridges, irregular protuberant rocks, and underground streams, is        
              important both to the understanding of hydrological processes and to the       
              resolution of groundwater pollution problems.  This doctoral                   
              dissertation project will assess the extent of groundwater pollution in        
              a representative karst landscape in southwestern Wisconsin, and it will        
              define and quantify the routes by which contaminants reach the aquifer.        
              Groundwater testing, identification of subsurface flow routes, and             
              measurement of solid and sediment infiltration rates will be used to           
              develop a predictive model of contaminant transport and behavior based         
              on the hydrogeology of the dolostone karst terrain.                            
                                                                                             
                   This project will provide valuable information about groundwater.         
              It will lead to enhancement of conceptual models of hydrogeological            
              processes, and it will identify more clearly how rapidly groundwater in        
              karst terrains becomes polluted and comtaminated, the mechanisms of            
              pollution, and the potential for self-correction of the problem.  This         
              project also will provide an excellent opportunity for a promising young       
              scholar to continue to develop independent research skills.
