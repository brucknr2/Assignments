Abstract    :
                   With the rapid accumulations of molecular sequence data,                  
              there is an increasing demand for rigorous methods for assessing               
              statistical significance of various sequence features.  The                    
              proposed research focuses on two sets of urn model problems which              
              are primarily directed to characterizing the spacings of long                  
              repeats in DNA sequences and discerning nonrandom charge clusters              
              in protein models.  The principal investigator will use this                   
              award to continue her contacts with a group of mathematicians at               
              the University of Southern California.  This contact will allow                
              the investigator to improve both her mathematical and biological               
              knowledge.
