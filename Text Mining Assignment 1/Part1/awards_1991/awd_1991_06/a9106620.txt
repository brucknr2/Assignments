Abstract    :
                   Saddlepoint methods have been particularly useful in the                  
              approximation of joint and conditional parametric density                      
              functions.  A theory of predictive inference has drawn heavily on              
              these constructions of approximate likelihoods; and this theory                
              will continue to be developed under this award.  However, the                  
              class of potential applications for saddlepoint methods is much                
              broader, and the principal focus for this research is this                     
              expansion into several new areas.  These include multivariate                  
              testing problems where the null distribution of the likelihood                 
              ratio statistics can be written in product Dirichlet form, also                
              finite (unequal probability) sampling schemes and resampling                   
              schemes, and response analysis for non-linear stochastic systems               
              prevalent in the engineering literature.
