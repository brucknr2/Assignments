Abstract    :
                   The South American continental plate overrides the Chile Rise             
              spreading center off the coast of southern Chile and the region is             
              thought to have had a relatively simple geometry and geologic                  
              history since the late Cenozoic.  Thus the region is one of the                
              simplest areas in which to study the tectonically important                    
              processes of an active triple junction.  This project will map and             
              analyze faults and sedimentary strata that are the result of the               
              Chile Rise collision.  The data will be integrated with results                
              from adjacent onland and offshore marine studies currently in                  
              progress by other investigators.  The results of this study will               
              provide important information on the geological consequences of                
              ridge/continental plate collision.
