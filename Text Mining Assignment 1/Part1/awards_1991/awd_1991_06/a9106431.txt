Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The exoprotein secretion ("Out") system of the plant pathogens                 
              Erwinia chrysanthemi and E. carotovora provide a promising                     
              experimental model for studying the translocation of proteins                  
              across the two membranes that envelope gram-negative bacteria.  The            
              bacteria selectively secrete a remarkable array of pectic enzymes              
              and other exoproteins.  A cluster of E. chrysanthemi "out" genes               
              enables Escherichia coli to secrete E. chrysanthemi exoproteins.               
              The E. chrysanthemi "out" genes are homologous with the pullulanase            
              secretion genes of Klebsiella pneumoniae, suggesting that the                  
              Erwinia model will be broadly relevant.  The two Erwinia "out"                 
              systems are conveniently specific for their respective exoproteins.            
              The objectives of this project are to complete the characterization            
              of the E. chrysanthemi "out" genes and encoded proteins by DNA                 
              sequence analysis and Tn5tac1 mutagenesis, identify the E.                     
              carotovora and E. chrysanthemi "out" components controlling                    
              exoprotein secretion specificity, and explore the secretion ability            
              of hybrid proteins and deletion derivatives involving E.                       
              chrysanthemi PelE and either E. carotovora Pel1 or beta-lactamase.             
                                                                                             
              An adequate understanding of the "out" pathway could lead to                   
              general techniques for either disrupting the secretion of virulence            
              proteins or enhancing secretion of beneficial proteins.
