Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A transcript at the flightless gene locus of Drosophila                        
              melanogaster exhibits significant homology with the cytoskeleton               
              regulating protein factor gelsolin from vertebrates. When                      
              mutagenized, the gene causes either severe disruptions of the                  
              flight muscle structure or embryonic death. Gelsolin is                        
              implicated in a plethora of morphogenetic processes by either                  
              promoting the formation of actin filaments from monomeric                      
              subunits, or by restricting their length in a calcium dependent                
              fashion. The molecular analysis of the Drosophila homologue of                 
              this family of actin-severing proteins will, for the first time,               
              provide a way to correlate the molecular structure of a                        
              cytoskeleton-regulating factor with the cellular effects of a                  
              specific mutation. The project proposes to determine                           
              transcriptional patterns of the flightless gene by DNA sequence                
              analysis and to study the developmental and tissue-specific                    
              expression by in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry.                   
              Furthermore, it is intended to analyze mutant alleles by the                   
              polymerase chain reaction to obtain information about functional               
              sites within the molecule, and to study the effects of over                    
              expression in situ by germ line transformation with a construct                
              containing the gelsolin gene under the control of heterologous                 
              promoter. The results from this study are expected to provide a                
              detailed understanding of functional domains of gelsolin its                   
              evolution, and of its role during embryonic development and                    
              myogenesis.
