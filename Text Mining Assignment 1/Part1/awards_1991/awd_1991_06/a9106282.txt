Abstract    :
                      The history of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)                 
              provides one of the best records of earth's climatic system                    
              responding to an internal oscillation rather than external                     
              forcing.  To date the best evidence for changes in ENSO have come              
              from historical observations, coral geochemistry and ice core                  
              changes in tropical highlands.  The Galapagos Islands have                     
              provided some of the best records of ENSO from corals, but there               
              has been no separate confirmation of the history of ENSO in this               
              region.  This proposal will rectify that omission by providing a               
              history of precipitation as recorded in the diatom abundances of               
              Galapagos lakes.  Since precipitation is directly related                      
              to ENSO intensity, this record will help to confirm the history                
              of ENSO for the last 500 years as well as extend it back at least              
              another 500 years.  This research is important because it will                 
              extend our record of ENSO back through two intervals in earth                  
              history when the climate system differed from today: the Little                
              Ice Age (17th to 19th century) and the Medieval Warm Period                    
              (circa. 12th century).
