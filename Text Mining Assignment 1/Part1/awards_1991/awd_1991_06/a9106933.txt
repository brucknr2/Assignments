Abstract    :
              This collaborative award is made under the Materials Chemistry                 
              and Chemical Processing Initiative and is supported by the                     
              Divisions of Chemistry and Materials Research.  The theme of                   
              the research is the synthesis, characterization and catalytic                  
              evaluation of supported alloy thin films prepared from main                    
              group-transition metal cluster precursors. Specifically, iron                  
              boride clusters will be prepared, characterized and decomposed                 
              on a variety of supports.  The supported alloys will be                        
              characterized and evaluated for catalytic oxidation of methane                 
              to formaldehyde. Solid catalysts known to be effective for the                 
              partial oxidation of methane will be promoted with iron boride                 
              films and evaluated. Once the role of the boride films is                      
              understood, the preparation will be modified to optimize the                   
              catalyst activity and selectivity to formaldehyde.

              Correlation of precursor structure, thin film properties and                   
              catalytic activity will impact both basic science and applied                  
              catalysis.
