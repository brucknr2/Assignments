Abstract    :
                   This project is concerned with free resolutions.  The                     
              principal investigators will study finite resolutions, with                    
              particular emphasis on the multiplicative structures they may                  
              support and their role in linkage theory.  Families of                         
              resolutions will be investigated including resolutions of objects              
              such as algebras in the linkage class of a complete intersection,              
              algebras defined by residual intersections and powers of perfect               
              ideals, canonical classes and other class group elements, and                  
              modules of finite length over rings of a fixed dimension.                      
                   Algebraic geometry is the study of the geometric objects                  
              arising from the sets of zeros of systems of polynomial                        
              equations.  This is one of the oldest and currently one of the                 
              most active branches of mathematics.  It has widespread                        
              applications in mathematics, computer science and physics.
