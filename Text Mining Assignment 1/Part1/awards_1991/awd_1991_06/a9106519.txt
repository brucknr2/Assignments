Abstract    :
              This U.S.-Italy award will support Professors Clifford                         
              Truesdell, Reza Malek-Madani, and John Pierce of Johns                         
              Hopkins University to collaborate with Italian mathematicians                  
              under the leadership of Prof. Gianfranco Capriz of the                         
              University of Pisa.  The investigators intend to work on the                   
              recent reorganization of the mathematical foundations of                       
              continuum mechanics begun by Professor Truesdell.  In the                      
              process, they expect to solve associated problems in topology,                 
              functional analysis, and geometric measure theory.                             
                                                                                             
              Among the topics to be studied are classes of solutions of                     
              Navier-Stokes equations, the formation and stability of                        
              singularities in systems of quasilinear elliptic and parabolic                 
              differential equations that govern the deformation of                          
              nonlinear viscous materials, the study of equilibria for                       
              highly symmetric boundary value problems which arise in                        
              nonlinear elasticity, and various aspects of the mathematical                  
              theory of singularities that lend themselves to continuum                      
              mechanics and applied mathematics.  Researchers on both sides                  
              are leading experts on various aspects of continuum mechanics                  
              and their collaboration is expected to lead to new approaches                  
              in the field.  This work is jointly supported by the Solid                     
              Mechanics and U.S.-Italy Programs of NSF.
