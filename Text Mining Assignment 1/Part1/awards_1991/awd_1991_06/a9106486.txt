Abstract    :
                   The objective of this project is the establishment of a                   
              United States/Spain joint study group to discuss and analyze                   
              engineering research and education issues related to manufacturing             
              industries.  Activities include tours to leading manufacturing                 
              industries, representative universities and governmental research              
              laboratories in both the United States and Spain as well as                    
              workshops at both of the lead institutions.  Anticipated results               
              include establishment of joint research activities, development of             
              exchange programs for faculty and students from one institution to             
              the other, development of programs to improve interaction between              
              universities and multinational industries, and the establishment               
              of programs to increase the number of manufacturing engineers in               
              each country, especially from population segments that do not                  
              traditionally select technologically oriented careers.  Workshop               
              proceedings and video documentation will be made available to                  
              interested parties in both countries.
