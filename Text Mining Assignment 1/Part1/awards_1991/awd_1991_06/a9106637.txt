Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The objective of the proposed program is to strengthen                         
              research in materials science and engineering at the                           
              University of Puerto Rico, Mayaguez Campus.  To accomplish                     
              this, a variety of activities will be implemented.                             
                                                                                             
              Research infrastructure will be strengthened by faculty and                    
              Hispanic student involvement in the following projects:
