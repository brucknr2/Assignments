Abstract    :
                   This award will support the research of Professor William                 
              H. Press, one postdoctoral fellow, and partial support for a                   
              graduate student, in the areas of cosmology, theoretical                       
              astrophysics, and computational theoretical physics, at                        
              Harvard University.  Continuing investigations by this group                   
              include:  three-dimensional computer simulations of                            
              fundamental fields that have been proposed as causing observed                 
              large scale structure; the theoretical development of future                   
              experimental and observational tests that might find, or rule                  
              out, additional scalar fields in gravity; the question of                      
              whether there are "natural" initial conditions for                             
              cosmological perturbations; some aspects of signal processing,                 
              e.g., for gravitational wave and dark matter experiments;                      
              computational algorithm development; and some other related                    
              problems.
