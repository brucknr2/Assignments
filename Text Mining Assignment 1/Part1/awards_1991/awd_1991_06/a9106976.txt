Abstract    :
                   Professor Slodkowski will investigate the structure of                    
              envelopes of holomorphy where he is especially interested in                   
              problems related to their construction and univalence.  Some                   
              questions of existence of analytic discs and varieties in envelopes            
              of holomorphy and of the uniqueness of Levi-flat hypersurfaces will            
              also be addressed.  Finding answers to these questions should be               
              very helpful in solving a second set of problems involving the                 
              extendibility of holomorphic motions and related questions                     
              concerning the holomorphic axiom of choice.                                    
                   The areas under investigation here involve the theory of                  
              functions of several complex variables.  The structure imposed by              
              requiring that a function of several complex variables be                      
              differentiable (as in elementary calculus) is a very rich one.  In             
              particular, given a set in which such a function is defined, it is             
              important to know the largest set to which all such functions can              
              be extended maintaining their differentiability.  This "envelope of            
              holomorphy" is not well understood and one of Professor                        
              Slodkowski's projects is to develop methods to find it.
