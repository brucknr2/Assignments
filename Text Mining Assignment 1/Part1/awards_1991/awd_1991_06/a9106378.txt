Abstract    :
              This project involves cultural and biological anthropologists                  
              studying the causes of growth variation in Ecuadorian children.                
              Households in two communities, one a more traditional farming                  
              community in the highlands and the other a more cash-crop                      
              oriented community in the lowlands will be studied.  Methods                   
              include participant observation, surveys, formal interviews, and               
              periodic measures of growth, illness and activity in a sample of               
              families.  The hypothesis to be tested is that the traditional                 
              farming regime produces children who grow better than those in                 
              the more "modern", cash crop regime, by providing a broader                    
              assortment of foods and allowing mothers more autonomy and                     
              control over resources.                                                        
                                                                                             
              This research is important because the issue of child health is                
              critical in the developing world, and development programs                     
              stressing "modern" cash-crop agriculture may be damaging the                   
              overall health of the families by ignoring issues of diet and                  
              mother's access to resources.  This project will provide a                     
              controlled comparison which will shed light on this issue.
