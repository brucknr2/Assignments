Abstract    :
                The continuing interest in information retrieval systems is based            
              upon the need to cope with the massive problems associated with                
              storage, access, and retrieval of information.  It is clear that               
              text processing is a vast area, which encompasses information                  
              retrieval, is of prime importance in computing and beyond, and that            
              it also relates to many aspects of computing, including                        
              architecture, data and file structures, and, of late, graphics and             
              interface design.  The ACM/SIGIR International Conference on                   
              Research and Development in Information Retrieval (ICRDIR) is the              
              premier conference concerned with the vital area of information                
              access and retrieval as it effects the important issues in text                
              processing.  The topics at ACM/SIGIR are highly interdisciplinary.             
              At least ten graduate students from different disciplines in                   
              various universities across the country are invited to participate             
              in the conference, based on submitted papers, in order to be able              
              to present their work and be exposed to scholars from all over the             
              world doing parallel work.  The students' participation offers them            
              the opportunity of getting wide feedback on their ideas, and on the            
              other hand enriches the conference by their innovative ideas.
