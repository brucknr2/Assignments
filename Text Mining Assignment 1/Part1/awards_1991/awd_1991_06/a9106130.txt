Abstract    :
              Regulated transcriptional termination and RNA processing of the                
              immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy chain gene during B cell development will            
              be examined.  The long-term goal of this research is to understand             
              the general mechanisms governing these events as well as to                    
              determine the basis for the developmentally regulated changes that             
              occur during B cell maturation.  Transcriptional termination of                
              normal and altered Ig u-o genes, introduced into established B and             
              plasmacytoma cell lines, will be analyzed using the standard                   
              nuclear run-on assay or a proposed PCR-based assay.  The                       
              contribution a functional poly (A) site and the downstream                     
              termination region make to termination within the u-o gene will be             
              analyzed by deleting the poly (A) sites, altering the poly (A) site            
              strength and mutating the termination region sequences.  To                    
              determine whether the regulated production of us and um RNA, which             
              is dependent on the efficiencies of two competing RNA processing               
              reactions, is a u gene-specific event or is instead due to global              
              changes in processing efficiencies, a non-Ig gene that can be                  
              alternatively processed by splicing and polyadenylation will be                
              expressed in B and plasmacytoma cells.  The u gene will be                     
              expressed in non-B cells to identify the non-regulated processing              
              pathway and, by inference, the regulated pathway.                              
                                                                                             
              The results from this study could have significant impact in other             
              systems where alternatively processed pre-mRNAs are invoked as well            
              as increasing our insight into the switching process in                        
              immunoglobin maturation.***//
