Abstract    :
                   In open models of the magnetosphere, the cleft is the                     
              dayside boundary between open and closed geomagnetic field lines.              
              There is considerable evidence that, within the cleft region, the              
              effects of the full range of solar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere               
              coupling phenomena can be observed.  These include Brikeland                   
              currents, strong electric fields, particle energization within                 
              localized regions, and intense ionospheric heating.  This grant                
              is directed towards experimental and theoretical studies of the                
              cleft and its dynamic behavior in response to variations in the                
              solar wind and IMF.  Coordinated analysis, using various                       
              combinations of data, will be performed.  These data include                   
              radar observations, magnetometer array data, satellite data, as                
              well as other ground data.  *** //
