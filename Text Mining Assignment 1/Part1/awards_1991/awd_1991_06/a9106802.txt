Abstract    :
              Filamentous cyanobacteria are unique microorganisms which can                  
              produce energy by plant type photosynthesis and reduce                         
              atmospheric nitrogen by nitrogen fixation.  Nitrogen fixation is               
              severely inhibited by the oxygen produced by photosynthesis;                   
              hence, these two incompatible metabolic processes are spatially                
              separated.  Photosynthesis occurs in vegetative cells and                      
              nitrogen fixation occurs in heterocysts.  Heterocysts are                      
              terminally differentiated cells which arise in a semi-regular                  
              pattern in a filament in response to starvation for fixed                      
              nitrogen.  Nitrogenase is the enzyme complex, localized in                     
              heterocysts, that is responsible for the reduction of atmospheric              
              nitrogen to ammonia.  The PI is interested in the regulatory                   
              signals which control expression of nitrogenase genes in                       
              heterocysts.  She has recently found a new set of genes that                   
              appear to code for a second nitrogenase in Anabaena variabilis.                
              This second nitrogenase is genetically similar to a vanadium-                  
              dependent nitrogenase characterized in two species of                          
              Azotobacter.  It does not appear to be another copy of the                     
              conventional nitrogenase of Anabaena.  The PI proposes to analyze              
              the two nitrogenase genes of Anabaena variabilis in an attempt to              
              identify regulatory sites and regulatory gene that are important               
              in developmental control of expression of nitrogenases.
