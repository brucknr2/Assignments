Abstract    :
              The principal investigator, in collaboration with Dr. John Bowman              
              (University of Utah), will study metamorphic rocks of the Big Maria            
              Mountains in southeastern California using petrologic and isotopic             
              techniques.  The investigation will help geologists to understand              
              fluid flow and fluid-rock interaction in rocks that have undergone             
              metamorphism at mid-crustal depths in the Earth.
