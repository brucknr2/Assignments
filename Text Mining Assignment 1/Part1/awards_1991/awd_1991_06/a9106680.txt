Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will continue his study of                     
              hydrodynamic behavior of a class of density dependent stochastic               
              reaction-diffusion models.  Laws of large numbers, central limit               
              theorems, and large deviation behavior will be investigated.                   
              Applications to related models and related areas such as stochastic            
              partial differential equations driven by jump processes will also              
              be pursued.  The work will contribute to the interaction of                    
              mathematics and the physical sciences.                                         
                   The principal investigator will continue his study of  the                
              derivation of certain macroscopic reaction-diffusion equations from            
              certain microscopic models of chemical reactions.  The work will               
              contribute to the interaction of mathematics and the physical                  
              sciences.
