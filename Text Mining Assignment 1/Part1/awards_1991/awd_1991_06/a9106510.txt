Abstract    :
              The principal investigator will design and implement efficient                 
              (space and time) algorithms for analyzing DNA and protein                      
              sequences.  The research will focus on three projects:  local                  
              similarity, multiple sequence alignment, and biosequence library               
              search.  These projects represent a continuation and expansion of              
              his work.  In particular a portion of the work will involve                    
              design and implementation of algorithms in parallel                            
              architectures.                                                                 
                                                                                             
              The principal investigator will design and implement efficient                 
              algorithms for analyzing DNA and protein sequences.  These                     
              algorithms will be useful to molecular biologists working in                   
              genetics, biophysics, and evolution.
