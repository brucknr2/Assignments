Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The fungus Mucor racemosus exists in both yeast-like and hyphal                
              forms, and this dimorphism has associated with it several protease             
              activities that appear morphology-specific.  One of these, a serine            
              carboxypeptidase termed CP3 is the focus of this research.  The                
              aims of the project include cloning and characterizing the                     
              structural gene that determines this protein, and to analyze the               
              expression of that gene in cells undergoing rapid morphogenesis.               
              The roles of proteolysis as regulatory mechanism(s) in cellular                
              metabolism should be better understood from these studies.
