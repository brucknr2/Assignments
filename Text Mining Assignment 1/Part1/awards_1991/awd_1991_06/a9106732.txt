Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award supports members of the NSF Science

              Professor Surendra P. Shah, to collaborate with                                
              members of the Department of Civil Engineering                                 
              of the Technische Hochschule Darmstadt, Germany,                               
              directed by Professor Gert Koenig.  They are                                   
              joining their resources and expertise in                                       
              experimental research to determine the factors                                 
              that influence the strain softening response of                                
              concrete in uniaxial compression and tension.                                  
              The research plan combines the expertise of TH                                 
              Darmstadt in large-scale structural testing and                                
              design with the knowledge of materials science                                 
              being developed at the Center for Advanced                                     
              Cement-Based Materials.                                                        
                                                                                             
              Recent advances in concrete technology have made                               
              it possible to make concrete with compressive                                  
              strength more than double that of normal                                       
              strength concrete.  This high strength concrete                                
              is used more and more in current construction,                                 
              because of perceived beneficial characteristics,                               
              but there is growing evidence that it is being                                 
              used improperly in some cases.  The increased                                  
              strength is due in part to an improved bond                                    
              between the cement-based matrix and aggregate in                               
              concrete.  However this improved bond makes the                                
              high strength concrete more brittle than normal                                
              concrete.  The failure mechanisms are poorly                                   
              understood.  Different failure mechanisms result                               
              in different strain softening response.  A                                     
              better understanding of the strain softening                                   
              response will help to define the appropriate use                               
              of this new material.
