Abstract    :
              The recent development of the atomic force microscope toward                   
              obtaining images from insulator surfaces opens the possibility of              
              insulator cluster studies.  Clusters from fundamentally and                    
              technologically important elements like silicon and carbon need to             
              be studied for an understanding of many properties and processes               
              concerning these materials in their various bulk crystalline                   
              configurations and surface structures.  Clusters will be deposited             
              on various crystalline substrates and the atomic arrangements will             
              be imaged by atomic force microscopy (AFM).  The AFM results should            
              provide new information on the static and dynamic behavior of the              
              clusters in addition to cluster-substrate interactions.  Size-                 
              selected clusters will be deposited on single crystal supports in              
              ultra-high-vacuum (UHV) using an ion-sputter generation source and             
              a quadrupole mass separator.  The substrates will be prepared by               
              standard UHV surface preparation methods, namely ion sputtering,               
              annealing, low-energy electron diffraction, and Auger analysis.                
              Electronic velocity filtering deposition of the ionized cluster                
              beam will ensure gentle deposition of the particles.  Deposition on            
              different types of substrates will show eventual changes in the                
              cluster geometries and the substrate lattice upon adsorption.                  
              Advances in this field have implications for currently used                    
              industrial processes and fields like microelectronics, sensors,                
              catalysis, coating technology, materials science, engineering of               
              semiconductor materials, and heterostructures.
