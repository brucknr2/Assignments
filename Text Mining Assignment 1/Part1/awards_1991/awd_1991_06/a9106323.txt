Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Cyanobacteria that are not di-nitrogen "fixing" will be studied in             
              terms of the dynamics of nitrogen metabolism as related to the                 
              unique nitrogen storage polymer, cyanophycin, during normal growth             
              conditions as well as in conditions where nitrogen limitation or               
              repletion exist.  NMR spectroscopy using N-15 and P-31 will be a               
              principal analytical tool to study N metabolism in vivo and to                 
              monitor the metabolic state of cells during shifts from one                    
              environmental state to another.  The studies are expected to lead              
              to a better understanding of gene regulation in this group of                  
              environmentally significant procaryotes particularly in terms of               
              the interactions of metabolic controls and environmental                       
              conditions.//
