Abstract    :
                   The Snowbird zone is a major structural break crossing North              
              America from the Rocky Mountains to Hudson Strait, it marks the                
              boundary between the Rae and Hearne Archean provinces and may                  
              represent the suture along which these ancient provinces (micro-               
              continents?) were attached.  This project is part of a                         
              collaborative research program with the Geological Survey of                   
              Canada.  It will focus on the metamorphic and structural history               
              of the tantato domain, one of the best exposed parts of the                    
              Snowbird deformation zone, in northeastern Saskatchewan.  Results              
              from the study of mylonites in the domain should help constrain the            
              relative motions and pressure-temperature conditions during the                
              deformation that produced the Snowbird zone, and therefore help                
              understand its significance in the Archean development of North                
              America.
