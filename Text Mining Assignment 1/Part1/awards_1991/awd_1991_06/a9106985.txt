Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              UCAR, with support from the Electric Power Research Institute                  
              (EPRI), is sponsoring the creation of a textbook for teaching how              
              an interdisciplinary climate system model is developed and used                
              for research.  This grant supports a two-week summer workshop for              
              about 40 first-term graduate students at which the draft                       
              textbook would be used to teach climate system modeling.  The                  
              two-week session would be taught by selected authors of the                    
              textbook and facility of the University for Wisconsin, Madison,                
              the site of the proposed workshop.
