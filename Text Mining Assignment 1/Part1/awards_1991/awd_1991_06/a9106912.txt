Abstract    :
              On-line monitoring of viable cell                                              
              density is important in monitoring                                             
              and controlling fermentation                                                   
              processes.  A new, on-line cell                                                
              density monitor is proposed which                                              
              can measure viable cell density                                                
              directly in a culture medium.  In                                              
              this method, viable cells are                                                  
              distinguished from other inert                                                 
              particles or dead cells by using the                                           
              characteristics of the living cells.                                           
              The speed in measurement is achieved                                           
              by fast counting.  The sensor will                                             
              be usable in any single cell                                                   
              cultures without requiring                                                     
              calibrations. An ultraviolet                                                   
              exposure system capable of                                                     
              transferring a sensor image onto a                                             
              silicon wafer is to be used to carry
