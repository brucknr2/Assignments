Abstract    :
                   This project will consider capillarity theory and related                 
              geometric problems including stability of liquid bridges, shape                
              and size estimates for pendent liquid drops, and discontinuous                 
              dependence theorems for capillary surfaces in the absence of                   
              gravity.  The project will also examine, through theory and                    
              experiments, axially symmetric fluid container shapes that admit               
              entire continua of symmetric surfaces which are not stable.                    
                   This work will contribute to the theoretical basis for                    
              experimental research on contact angle of liquids in space
