Abstract    :
                   Traditional Bayesian inference has followed the paradigm of               
              expressing information and degree of uncertainty about the                     
              information prior to the gathering of data, and then reexpressing              
              the collective information and subsequent degree of uncertainty                
              after incorporating the data.  Much of the Bayesian research on a              
              wide variety of statistical issues has used parametrized                       
              functions in this paradigm.  The extension of statistical theory               
              and methodology to broader classes of functions, or even to                    
              procedures, which are no longer simply characterized by small                  
              numbers of parameters, requires extension of this Bayesian                     
              paradigm.  This research addresses several specific extensions of              
              this kind: monotone densities and monotone hazard rates and their              
              extension to spherical distributions, bootstrap procedures, and                
              infinite-dimensional parametric problems.
