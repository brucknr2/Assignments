Abstract    :
                   Common measures of association such as the correlation                    
              coefficient need expanded definitions or reformulations when                   
              nonparametric or semiparametric models replace familiar                        
              parametric ones.  One expanded definition uses curves to express               
              these relationships.  This research will develop an asymptotic                 
              theory of estimates of such curves.  Further extensions to the                 
              case of several covariates will be considered.
