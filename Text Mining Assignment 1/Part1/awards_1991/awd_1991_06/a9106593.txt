Abstract    :
                   Research in theoretical elementary particle physics will                  
              focus on the possibility that the "elementary particles" are                   
              the vibrational states of extremely tiny strings, or perhaps                   
              of tiny membranes.  Efforts will be made both to develop this                  
              possibility further, and to explore its experimental                           
              consequences.  The speculation that the elementary particles                   
              may be understood in terms of tiny strings has excited very                    
              considerable interest because of the belief that the string                    
              picture may provide a consistent and unified theory of all of                  
              the basic forces of nature.
