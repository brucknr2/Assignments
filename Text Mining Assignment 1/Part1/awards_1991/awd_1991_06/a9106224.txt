Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Description:  In a joint project, Dr. Victor Zakkay of New                     
              York University (NYU), and Drs. V. Krishna Sastri and A.K.                     
              Kolar of the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras (IITM)                     
              plan to extend their studies on Pressurized Fluid Bed                          
              Combustion (PFBC).  The studies will focus on the                              
              fundamental areas of concern to PFBC including: parametric                     
              studies on vertical heat exchangers; bubble dynamics with                      
              immersed horizontal and vertical heat exchangers; and                          
              combustion and emission characteristics of high moisture                       
              lignite, high ash coal and high sulpher coal.  Tests will                      
              be conducted at a recently completed facility for PFBC at                      
              the IITM which has a combustor of 30 cm diameter, and is                       
              capable of operating up to 15 atmospheric pressure.                            
                                                                                             
              Scope:  This project extends for two years the support                         
              provided earlier by NSF to the U.S. and Indian scientists                      
              for studies aimed at understanding the parameters affecting                    
              the behavior of PFBC and the usefulness of this method of                      
              coal combustion.  The facility at IITM and the Indian staff                    
              provide excellent opportunity for extending and broadening                     
              the investigations being conducted in the U.S. and other                       
              countries in this field.  The importance of PFBC is well                       
              recognized in both countries as well as by other countries                     
              with low quality coal.  The project has the backing of the                     
              Government of India as well as major coal users in that                        
              country.                                                                       
              Funding:  The project is funded under two grants:                              
              INT 9106224 to the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras.                     
              INT 9012682 to New York University.
