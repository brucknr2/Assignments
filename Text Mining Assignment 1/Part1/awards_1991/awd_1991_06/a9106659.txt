Abstract    :
              The physical structure of the "30 nm" chromosome fiber is a                    
              fundamental unknown of eukaryotic genetics.  The fibers play an                
              integral role in gene storage, segregation, expression,                        
              replication, recombination, damage, and repair.  Detailed                      
              knowledge of the 3-dimensional structure of chromatin fibers will              
              give insight into the essential protein and DNA contacts that                  
              stabilize chromosome structure, constraints imposed on DNA                     
              sequence and structure, and constraints placed on the enzymatic                
              machinery that interacts with the genome.  Those insights will be              
              important to understanding the normal and abnormal regulation of               
              growth and differentiation.                                                    
                                                                                             
              The research supported by this award will focus on how nucleosome              
              are packed into "30 nm" fibers under physiological conditions.                 
              This team of researchers proposes to determine important                       
              structural parameters of chromatin fibers by quantitative cryoEM               
              and x-ray scattering, using specially-chosen fully hydrated                    
              chromatin molecules.  In addition, the research team will make                 
              the first attempts to study the structure of chromatin designed                
              to have homogeneous properties. We will determine the following                
              structural parameters:  1)  radial distribution of density;  2)                
              radial distribution of protein, DNA, and counterions;  3)  radial              
              distributions of HMG14/17; and 4)  diameter, axial repeat, mass                
              per unit length, and helical symmetry satellite chromatin chosen               
              to be homogeneous by virtue of strong phasing of nucleosomes                   
              along the repetitious DNA sequence.  Our goal is to determine a                
              model-independent, low resolution maps of protein and DNA in                   
              thick chromatin fibers, which can be combined with higher                      
              resolution crystallographic information about the nucleosome                   
              cores to determine the pattern of interactions stabilizing                     
              chromatin fibers in cells.
