Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              One of the most significant impediments to the ability of                      
              ecologists to contribute to understanding and solving issues                   
              associated with global change is the inability to characterize                 
              ecosystem structure and dynamics at scales that are relevant to                
              those issues.  To date, ecologists have not taken full advantage               
              of the approaches used and advances made by the remainder of the               
              earth science community.  As a step in the process of increasing,              
              the ability of ecologists to exchange results with other earth                 
              scientists, this project will conduct a regional analysis of the               
              central grasslands of the United States.  The objectives of the                
              analysis are to understand the current state of ecosystems in the              
              region and to evaluate their potential responses to climate and                
              management change.  The approach will involve constructing a                   
              regional database, statistically evaluating relationships among                
              biotic and abiotic variables in the database, and using                        
              simulation models to assess the current state of the region and                
              to understand the potential regional consequences of climate                   
              change.
