Abstract    :
              There is some amount of variation in almost every trait in every               
              species that exists, and part of the cause of this variation is                
              genetic.  The well known forces of directional selection and                   
              genetic drift both act to reduce variation, so its maintenance is              
              difficult to explain, and has been a long standing problem.  The               
              small marine crustacean, Paracercus sculpta has three different                
              genetically based male body forms, which affect their ability to               
              attract and mate with females.  The proposed research will                     
              capitalize on this system to first identify the precise mode of                
              inheritance, then describe how the environment influences the                  
              expression of the genotypes responsible for the different forms,               
              and lastly attempt to account for the evolutionary forces that                 
              allow the three morphs to coexist.  This system is uniquely                    
              suited to address these important questions, because the                       
              genotypes and the environments are easily manipulated, and the                 
              organism has a short generation time so that experiments can be                
              done quickly.  Furthermore, the answers should have broad                      
              generality for explaining the ubiquitous variation in nature.//
