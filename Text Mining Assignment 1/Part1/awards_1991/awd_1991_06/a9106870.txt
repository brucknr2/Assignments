Abstract    :
                   The insight and intuition developed over the past 50 years                
              about how species form in terrestrial habitats does not apply                  
              often to speciation in the sea.  Two new biological tools will be              
              used in the study of marine speciation in order to understand                  
              biodiversity in the world's most diverse marine habitat:  the                  
              Indo-West Pacific.                                                             
                   Recent advances in biotechnology allow DNA segments from the              
              nuclear and mitochondrial genomes of four species of tropical sea              
              urchins to be sequenced.  Previous results show that these                     
              species are the most closely related urchin species known, and                 
              new sequence data will show how genetic distinctions arise early               
              in the divergence of new species.  The data analysis will take                 
              advantage of recent techniques that emphasize the genealogical                 
              trees of DNA sequences.  The parallel analysis of different types              
              of DNA segments will provide a unique body of information                      
              explaining the evolutionary events surrounding speciation in the               
              group.  The results will be generalizable to other groups, and                 
              allow an understanding of how and why the large number of co-                  
              occurring species in the tropical oceans has arisen and is                     
              maintained.
