Abstract    :
              With this award the Synthetic Organic Program of the Chemistry                 
              Division will support the research of Dr. Jeffrey H. Byers of                  
              the Department Chemistry of Middlebury College.  The project is                
              directed towards the development of new carbon-carbon bond                     
              forming reactions. It will utilize 2- phenylselenyl-                           
              1,3-dicarbonyl compounds, such as malonates, in a free radical                 
              reaction with olefins. Both inter- and intramolecular processes                
              will be investigated in order to gain a better understanding of                
              the scope and limitations of the reaction. Based upon these                    
              studies, the methodology will be applied to the synthesis of                   
              several simple, but important classes of organic compounds,                    
              including amino acids, butanolides, and tetronic acids.

              This research is in the area of synthetic methodology and will                 
              develop a new carbon-carbon bond forming reaction, one of the                  
              most important classes of reactions in organic chemistry, using                
              organoselenium compounds. To demonstrate the applicability of                  
              this methodology, it will be used to synthesize several simple,                
              but important classes of organic molecules.
