Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Hydrographic and Chlorofluorocarbon measurements will be taken                 
              along a meridional section of the South Atlantic Ocean, with                   
              additional sections along the equator and 10 degrees South to                  
              determine the role played by the deep basin circulation of                     
              Antarctic Bottom Water on climate change on decadal time scales.               
              This work is part of the Deep Basin Experiment, a component of the             
              World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE).
