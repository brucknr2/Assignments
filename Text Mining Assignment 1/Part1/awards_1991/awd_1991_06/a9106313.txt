Abstract    :
              The principal investigator will study the solubility of silicate               
              minerals in various aqueous solutions at elevated temperatures                 
              and pressures.  Measurements to 5 kilobars will provide data in a              
              pressure range for which no data currently exist.  These data are              
              important to understanding the interaction between fluids and                  
              rocks during metamorphism of the Earth's crust.
