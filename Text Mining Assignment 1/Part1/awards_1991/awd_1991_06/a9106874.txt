Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Under this grant, the University of Rhode Island will carry               
              out its first, in a series, major initiatives in educational                   
              outreach related to the science and social science aspects of                  
              global environmental change through the mechanism of an Honor's                
              Colloquium for the spring semester 1991.  The Honor's Colloquium               
              is a combination of public outreach, in the form of Wednesday                  
              evening public lectures and a complementary undergraduate course               
              for freshman and sophomore Honor's students.  The University of                
              Rhode Island will bring world-renown educators and scientists to               
              the campus during the spring 1991 for the Wednesday evening                    
              lectures.  They will videotape the evening lectures for long-term              
              educational prospects in the form of additional-to-offered-                    
              courses and the development of a new course for the distance-                  
              learning market.  The invited speaker presentations will be                    
              published and available along with curriculum materials and                    
              readings to other interested educational institutions and public               
              groups through a number of networks and mechanisms.  A                         
              Colloquium volume will be  produced through the Marine Technology              
              Society through a special issue of the Marine Technology Society               
              Journal.  This activity is important because it seeks to increase              
              the pool of qualified students entering the environmental                      
              sciences.
