Abstract    :
              The purpose of this research is to extend recent work                          
              of the investigators in the area of power system                               
              reliability and the computation of variance and higher                         
              order moments of power system production costs.  It                            
              is expected that this work will add insight to the                             
              relationship between production costing models based                           
              on chronological simulation and those based on the                             
              load duration curve.
