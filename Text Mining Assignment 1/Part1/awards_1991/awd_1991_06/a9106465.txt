Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              Proper mapping of processors is a critical component of programming            
              on message-passing machines.  The proposed research focuses on the             
              design and development of a prototype environment-sensitive mapping            
              tool which allows the programmer to generate, assess and optimize              
              mappings.  The prototype mapping tool will be integrated with                  
              modified tools for parallel debugging, performance monitoring and              
              program visualization.  The resulting new more complete environment            
              will be targeted to MIMD, message passing multiprocessors.//
