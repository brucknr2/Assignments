Abstract    :
                 State of the art network security is based on end-to-end                    
              encryption and link encryption.  Many operations on networks are               
              however broadcast ( or multicast or flooding) oriented.  This                  
              implies that the straightforward application of link or end-to-end             
              oriented authentication techniques to network integrity implies                
              either that the required bandwidth increases dramatically or that              
              a terrible key management problem is created.  A geometry-based                
              non-interactive unconditional authentication scheme for a single-              
              sender-multiple-receiver environment has been co-authored by                   
              the principal investigator.  The solution is based on secret                   
              sharing (threshold) schemes.  This gives rise to the following open            
              problems to be investigated in this research: (1) can                          
              unconditionally and conditionally secure multi-sender and multi-               
              receiver authentication and privacy schemes which are (partially)              
              non-interactive be achieved (2) is there a duality between sharing             
              and authentication (3) what are the most optimal schemes and what              
              other enhancements can be obtained?  Geometry could continue to                
              play an important role in solving the above problems.
