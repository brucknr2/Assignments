Abstract    :
              A variety of life processes, ranging from muscle contraction to                
              nutrient absorption, are either triggered or driven by the                     
              selective transport of ions across cell membranes.  The working                
              hypothesis in virtually all models of mammalian active ion                     
              transport is that the carrier can assume different conformations in            
              which the ion binding sites are alternately exposed to opposite                
              sides of the membrane.  The mechanism of the conformational change             
              is unknown.  Does the conformational change gate a channel, or is              
              extensive rearrangement of the protein structure involved?  The                
              principal objective of the research proposed in this application is            
              to obtain physicochemical data on the conformational transition                
              step in the reaction mechanism to permit discrimination among                  
              alternative proposals for active ion transport.  The forward and               
              reverse rates of the conformational change reported by fluorescent             
              labeling of E1E2-pumps will be measured as a function of                       
              temperature.  Analysis of the results by absolute reaction rate                
              theory places contraints on the types of molecular chemical events             
              that are occurring by resolving the enery which determines the rate            
              and extent of reaction into heat changes resulting from formation,             
              or cleavage, of chemical bonds and into changes in the organization            
              of the system that increase, or decrease, the number of molecular              
              degrees of freedom.  The transport enzyme, the monovalent cation               
              and the solvent structure will be empirically varied to learn which            
              reactants are important and how they affect the conformational                 
              change in E1E2-enyzmes.
