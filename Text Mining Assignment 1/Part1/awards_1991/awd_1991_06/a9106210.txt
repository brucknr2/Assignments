Abstract    :
                   A broad program of research in theoretical physics and                    
              theoretical astrophysics, involving many postdoctoral scholars                 
              and visitors, will be carried out.  Topics will include the                    
              string theory of the elementary particles and the basic                        
              forces, the solar neutrino problem, quantum field theories of                  
              the elementary particles, neutrino astrophysics, and                           
              astrophysical processes.  The program will serve not only to                   
              address interesting questions and produce important new                        
              results in physics and astrophysics, but also as a training                    
              ground for the postdoctoral scholars.
