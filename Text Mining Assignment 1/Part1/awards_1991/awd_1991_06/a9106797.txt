Abstract    :
                   The objectives of this research are (A) highly accurate                   
              calculations on small systems for comparison with recent high                  
              precision measurements, and (B) the development of better                      
              computational methods, where "better" means greater accuracy                   
              and reliability with a smaller expenditure of computer time.                   
                   Specific problems to be considered include (1) The 1/Z                    
              expansion, (2) Bethe logarithms and other matrix elements of                   
              functions of operators, (3) Hydrogen in strong magnetic                        
              fields, (4) Basis functions for problems with multiple length                  
              scales, (5) High precision calculations for lithium atoms, (6)                 
              Simplification of the Fock expansions, and (7) A priori                        
              estimates of non-linear parameters in basis functions.
