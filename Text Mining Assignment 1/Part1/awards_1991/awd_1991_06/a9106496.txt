Abstract    :
              Investigation will be continued for building more powerful computer            
              programs for proving theorems in mathematics.  The work can be divided         
              into subareas: building provers with large-step capacity; using analogy        
              to aid in proof discovery; combining known methods for new proofs in           
              higher order logic; and mechanical methods for streamlining proofs.
