Abstract    :
                   Debugging of real-time distributed software systems is difficult          
              because of timing constraints imposed on them and because of their             
              non-deterministic behavior.  Conventional static analysis methods are          
              not adequate to deal with the violation of timing constraints which            
              are inherent in real-time distributed software systems.  This research         
              develops a dynamic analysis method which uses recorded run-time                
              information to debug these kinds of timing errors.  Based on this              
              approach, a non-interference monitoring architecture will be developed         
              to collect the process-level and the function-level program execution          
              data of a target real-time distributed system.  Different-leveled              
              logical views can be reconstructed from this collected run-time                
              information.  The dynamic analysis method will then be developed to            
              analyze the timing behavior of real-time distributed software systems.
