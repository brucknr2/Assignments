Abstract    :
              This award is made as the starter grant increment of Dr.                       
              Raymond Goldstein's Postdoctoral Fellowship in Chemistry Award                 
              in support of his research at Princeton University. The thrust                 
              of Dr. Goldstein's research is the study of the motion of                      
              colloidal surfaces such as cell membranes and nucleic acids.                   
              The spatial patterns formed by these surfaces generally occur                  
              on length scales larger than molecular, and may be described by                
              a continuum elastic theory.                                                    
                                                                                             
              The research involves the development of formalisms for such                   
              constrained variational dynamics dominated by dissipation.  A                  
              first step toward understanding the role of surface geometry                   
              and elasticity in the motion involves a local description of                   
              the viscous dissipation as in the dynamics of an isolated                      
              Brownian particle. Generalizations of a recently developed                     
              approach for two-dimensional systems are envisioned for the                    
              study of closed polymers with bending and torsional energy and                 
              of membranes with diffusing impurities coupled to the local                    
              geometry, and to develop a finite-temperature Langevin dynamics                
              for closed surfaces--a statistical mechanics of shapes.
