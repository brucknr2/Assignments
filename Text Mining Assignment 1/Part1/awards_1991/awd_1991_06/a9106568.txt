Abstract    :
              The objective of this proposal is the development of a full-                    
                                                                                            
              field measuring technique for particle velocity and size based                 
                                                                                             
              on particle image velocimetry methods.  The resolution,                        
              accuracy and biases of the technique will be investigated.                     
              The approach will be illustrated for a transient spray.  The                   
                                                                                             
              main areas of application will be in two-phase turbulent and                   
                                                                                             
              transient flows. A main contribution is the automation of                      
              particle size measurement, as an alternative to direct                         
              imaging.  A key issue which has to be solved is the                            
              correlation between the velocity  and particle size.  If                       
              successful, the proposed technique will be a significant                       
              advancement for a combined full-field  particle velocimetry                    
              and particle sizing measurement, with  application to                          
              particles, droplets or bubbles of any shape.   This is a                       
              complimentary method for the point measurements with phase                     
              Doppler velocimetry.
