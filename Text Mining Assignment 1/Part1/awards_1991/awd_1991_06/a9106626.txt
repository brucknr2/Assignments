Abstract    :
              With this grant in the Theoretical and Computational program of                
              the Chemistry Division, Professor Michl will organize and fund                 
              the travel of young faculty, advanced graduate students, and                   
              invited speakers to attend the VIIth International Congress on                 
              Quantum Chemistry in Menton, France, July 2-5, 1991. The                       
              scientific program consists of plenary lectures, topical                       
              symposia, poster sessions, and satellite meetings. The five                    
              satellite meetings will immediately preceed the conference and                 
              will be in the areas of: catalysis, electron transfer, recent                  
              methodological advances in dynamical and in correlation                        
              calculations, computer simulations of biomolecular systems, and                
              new materials.
