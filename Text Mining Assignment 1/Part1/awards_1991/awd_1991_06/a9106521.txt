Abstract    :
                   In this project the principal investigators will continue                 
              their study of new, higher-genus solutions of the Yang-Baxter                  
              equation in the chiral Potts model.  These solutions describe                  
              phase transitions in experimentally realizable systems and they                
              serve as representatives of various universality classes.  In                  
              addition, the principal investigators will look at spin-spin                   
              correlation functions of the Z-invariant inhomogeneous Ising                   
              model on an irregular lattice, in order to obtain the correlation              
              functions of certain quasicrystals and some quasiperiodic Ising                
              lattices.                                                                      
                   Models in statistical mechanics are an important vehicle for              
              improving our understanding of ordered structures such as                      
              crystals.  In addition, the study of models like the chiral Potts              
              model involves a nice interplay between mathematics and physics                
              that serves to enhance both fields.  In this project the                       
              principal investigators will look for new solutions of the Yang-               
              Baxter equation that describe quasicrystals and quasiperiodic                  
              lattices.  This work touches upon other topics on the border                   
              between mathematics and physics such as quantum groups and knot                
              theory, monopoles and string theory, phase transitions in                      
              condensed matter and biomembranes in biophysics.
