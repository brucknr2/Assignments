Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Cold Spring Harbor Symposia are held yearly at the beginning               
              of June at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor,              
              New York.  They bring together approximately 300-400 scientists                
              from all over the world to present and evaluate new data and ideas             
              in rapidly moving areas of biological research.  Each year a topic             
              is chosen that seems to be at a stage where general and intensive              
              scrutiny and review is needed.  A Cold Spring Harbor Banbury                   
              meeting in 1988 set the stage for the subsequent merger of a wide              
              range of approaches to the cell cycle.  For the first time those               
              working on signal transduction, ascomycete genetics and marine                 
              invertebrates began to be able to talk in a common language.  This             
              followed the realization that several critical cell cycle                      
              regulators are conserved throughout eukaryotic evolution.                      
              Following a period of remarkable unification, the cell cycle field             
              has now developed into one that attracts the attention of                      
              scientists from a variety of very different disciplines.                       
                                                                                             
              The 56th Cold Spring Harbor Symposium entitled The Cell Cycle is               
              designed to bring together those who work on aspects of signal                 
              transduction, mitotic control, mitosis, and DNA replication.  By               
              illustrating the very different approaches that are taken to a                 
              common problem, this Symposium will reinforce the interactions that            
              have recently brought this field such vitality.
