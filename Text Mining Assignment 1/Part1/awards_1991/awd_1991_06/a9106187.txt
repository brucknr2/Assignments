Abstract    :
                   In the last two decades, there has been remarkable progress               
              in the theory of operator algebras and its applications to both                
              mathematics and physics.  The modern theory of operator algebras               
              interacts with a wide variety of specific areas, including index               
              theory for foliated manifolds, the geometry of multi-connected                 
              manifolds, difference differential equations, quantum groups,                  
              quantum physics, the Yang Baxter equation, the theory of knots                 
              and links, and via the latter, even the study of DNA by                        
              biologists.                                                                    
                   In view of the rapid advances in the field and the                        
              preeminence of the West Coast in research in operator algebra                  
              theory, this grant will support a West Coast Operator Algebra                  
              Seminar in October, 1991.  This will enable researchers to assess              
              the latest achievements and further stimulate research                         
              activities.
