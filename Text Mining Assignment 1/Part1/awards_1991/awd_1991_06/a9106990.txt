Abstract    :
              Partial support is provided for a conference on the application of             
              diamond films and related materials in tribological applications,              
              for use as coatings on cutting tools and for optical and electronic            
              uses.  The conference will address the apparent gap between process            
              development for these technologically promising films and their                
              application.
