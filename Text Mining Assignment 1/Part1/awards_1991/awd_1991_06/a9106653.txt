Abstract    :
                   This RUI grant supports the research of Professor T. Schmidt.             
              He will work on the Chinburg conjecture about the interplay between            
              analytically defined invariants in a number field and the algebraic            
              structure of the S-units in Quaternion extensions of the rationals.            
                   This is research in the field of number theory.  Number                   
              theory starts with the whole numbers and questions such as the                 
              divisibility of one whole number by another.  It is among the                  
              oldest fields of mathematics and it was originally pursued for                 
              purely aesthetic reasons.  However, within the last half century,              
              it has become an essential tool in developing new algorithms for               
              computer science and new error correcting codes for electronics.
