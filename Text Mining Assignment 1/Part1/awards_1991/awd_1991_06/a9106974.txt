Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will conduct research in four                  
              areas:  1)  development and application of statistical methods                 
              for identifying and interpreting unusual molecular sequence                    
              features and studies on related  probability limit theorems of                 
              various functionals on random letter sequences;  2)  statistical               
              studies of inhomogeneities in DNA sequences;  3)  mathematical                 
              modeling in evolutionary processes; and  4)  total positivity and              
              applications in probability, statistics and analysis.  The first               
              two topics will have impact on molecular biology studies and data              
              analysis.
