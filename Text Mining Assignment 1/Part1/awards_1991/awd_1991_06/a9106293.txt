Abstract    :
              The subject of this proposal is cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), a wide            
              host-range plant virus for which there is very little natural                  
              resistance available.  The goals of this project are: (1) to                   
              localize sequences in the viral genome involved in the regulation              
              of the rate of replication, and the inhibition of replication by               
              high temperatures; (2) to determine the underlying mechanisms of               
              differential replication in plant cells (protoplast) affected by               
              various genetic alterations; and (3) to determine the regulatory               
              effects of various genetic alterations on the viral replicase in               
              vitro.  These goals will be achieved by using biologically-active              
              DNA clones of strains of CMV, that show differences in the                     
              regulation various aspects of CMV (and satellite) RNA replication              
              in several cucurbit hosts.  The sequences controlling the various              
              replicate-related phenotypes will be mapped by recombination and               
              site-directed mutagenesis of the DNA clones.  The specific                     
              functions altered by these sequence substitutions will be                      
              determined by analyses of the replication products both in in vitro            
              infected protoplasts, as well as of the purified viral replicase               
              provided with the appropriate templates and incubated under the                
              experimental conditions.  These analyses will relate differences               
              in viral protein structure to specific functions.***//
