Abstract    :
              This project supports the dissertation research of a cultural                  
              anthropologist from Syracuse University.  The project will study               
              the use of traditional medicine by rural poor in three                         
              communities in the Dominican Republic: one of Haitian, one of                  
              Spanish identity, and one of African-American descendants of                   
              nineteenth-century migrants. The project will focus on women                   
              healers and will use a combination of participant observation,                 
              in-depth interviews and survey research to study the healer's                  
              role in their societies and the differences in usage of these                  
              traditional healers as opposed to urban biomedical physicians in               
              these three cultural communities..                                             
                                                                                             
              This research is important because most poor areas of the world                
              are underserved by trained biomedical physicians, and                          
              understanding the roles and activities of traditional healers                  
              will aid planners to develop programs of health care for                       
              underserved rural areas in developing countries.
