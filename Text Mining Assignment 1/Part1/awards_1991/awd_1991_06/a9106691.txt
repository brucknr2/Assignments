Abstract    :
              Duke University Medical Center is currently improving its                      
              facilities for Molecular Biophysics, and this equipment will be                
              central to an X-ray 'shared resource' of the Duke Comprehensive                
              Cancer Center.  It will be available to all faculty members in                 
              this field of research and will help the Department of                         
              Biochemistry in their efforts to attract a new faculty member in               
              the field of protein crystallography.  Finally, it will also act               
              as a major focus for a Molecular Biophysics graduate program that              
              is being developed within the Medical School.  The program will                
              help to attract quality students to the many groups at Duke that               
              are becoming involved in structural research.
