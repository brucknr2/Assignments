Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This sample preparation equipment includes a state-of-the-art ion              
              mill, a specimen grinding system, and a new parallel electron                  
              energy loss spectrometer acquisition system to be used for hard and            
              brittle samples prior to study in the existing transmission                    
              electron microscopes, scanning electron microscopes, and scanning              
              auger spectrometer housed in the Microstructural Analysis Facility.            
              %%%                                                                            
              The Facility operates as a cost-center and includes two TEM's, two             
              SEM's, two hot-stages, an evaporator, an electropolishing unit, an             
              oven and grinding wheels for sample preparation.  A new scanning               
              Auger is being acquired.  Two technicians operate and maintain the             
              instruments, which primarily serve Materials Engineering,                      
              Electrical Engineering, Chemical Engineering, Physics and Chemistry            
              Departments.
