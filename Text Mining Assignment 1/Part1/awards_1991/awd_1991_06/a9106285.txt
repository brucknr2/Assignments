Abstract    :
                   Professor Phillips will investigate the concept of exponential            
              rank in C*-algebras.  In particular he will (a) obtain a better                
              understanding of the exponential rank of algebras of matrix valued             
              functions, and the possible connections with real rank, (b)                    
              determine the exponential rank of stable C*-algebras, and (c)                  
              further investigate the relation between real rank zero and the                
              property weak (FU).  In addition Professor Phillips will                       
              investigate the homotopy theory of inverse limits of C*-algebras.              
                   The notion of a C* algebra is an abstraction of the idea of a             
              family of linear transformations on a space.  These transformations            
              can also be thought of as having values in the states of the space,            
              and the property of this family which is responsible for the symbol            
              * is that the algebra is generated by transformations whose values             
              in these states are real numbers.  The fact that these objects                 
              appear naturally in many branches of mathematics and physics make              
              them important to study.
