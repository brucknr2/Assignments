Abstract    :
                   This project will consider semilinear partial differential                
              equations with critical exponents.  Topics to be studied include               
              the Kazdan-Warner problem in bounded regions with Dirichlet                    
              boundary condition, further analysis of the constant in the                    
              Sobolev inequality, and multiplicity of solutions for the Neumann              
              problem.                                                                       
                   These problems are motivated by questions arising in areas                
              as diverse as differential geometry and mathematical biology.                  
              Basic questions such as the existence of surfaces with prescribed              
              curvature or the properties of the equilibria of biological                    
              population models will benefit from the results of this project.
