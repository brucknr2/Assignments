Abstract    :
              Primary goal is to use Hf isotope ratios to determine the extent               
              and timing of High Field Strength Element (HFSE) depletions in                 
              the astenospheric and lithospheric mantle beneath the western                  
              U.S.A.  These depletions are common in many mafic lavas.  Mafic                
              magmas derived through melting of shallow mantle, such as                      
              continental basaltic magmas derived from the lithosphere, are the              
              most likely candidates to have high 176Hf/177Hf ratios; these                  
              would stand in marked contrast with low 143Nd/144Nd ratios of                  
              what is often considered to be the subcontinental lithospheric                 
              mantle.  Initial results from the Rio Grande rift region                       
              indicate that both high and low 176Hf/177Hf mantle exists beneath              
              the rift.  This study will include work in four areas that                     
              encompass a wide variety of isotopic and chemical composition of               
              the underlying mantle.  Epsilon Nd values for primitive Cenozoic               
              lavas from the western U.S. span almost 20 units indicating                    
              complex interaction between multiple sources.  The Hf isotope                  
              compositions of these sources, however, are largely unknown.
