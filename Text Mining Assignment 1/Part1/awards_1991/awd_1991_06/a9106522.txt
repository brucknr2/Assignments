Abstract    :
                   Aspects of the topology of algebraic varieties will be                    
              studied.  Particular emphasis will be on the development of new                
              topological invariants or techniques (e.g. Intersection Homology,              
              Motivic Cohomology, Perverse Sheaves) and on the study of                      
              particular varieties which are important in applications (e.g.                 
              Modular Varieties, Configuration Spaces).                                      
                   Algebraic varieties are spaces defined by polynomial                      
              equations.  They should be particularly simple, but their                      
              topology can be more complicated than this suggests.  Since they               
              arise in many different contexts, it is important to classify and              
              analyze them.
