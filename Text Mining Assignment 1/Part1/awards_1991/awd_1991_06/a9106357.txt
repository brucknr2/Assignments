Abstract    :
                   This work will use the quantum kinetic equations in a                     
              Green's function formalism to study the properties of nuclear                  
              matter under conditions relevant for heavy-ion collisions at                   
              100's MeV/nucleon.  The work will not be restricted to the                     
              quasi-particle approximation.  The spreading widths of                         
              spectral functions and the energy dependence of the mean field                 
              will be taken into account.
