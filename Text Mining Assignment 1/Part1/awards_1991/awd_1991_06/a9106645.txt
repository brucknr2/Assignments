Abstract    :
              The production and maintenance of reliable software require powerful           
              and rigorous analysis methods.  Analysis techniques for sequential             
              systems have generally suffered from limited applicability or                  
              computational intractability.  Analysis of concurrent software is even         
              more difficult.  In a previous project supported by the NSF, a toolset         
              automating the constrained expression techniques for analyzing                 
              concurrent software systems was constructed.  Experiments with that            
              toolset have shown that it is capable of analyzing systems that                
              approach realistic sizes for designs of concurrent systems.  This              
              project will involve efforts to extend the range of questions that the         
              constrained expression toolset can address and to increase the size of         
              the systems it can handle.  This will involve theoretical work on the          
              constrained expression formalism and analysis techniques and the               
              modification of the existing toolset.
