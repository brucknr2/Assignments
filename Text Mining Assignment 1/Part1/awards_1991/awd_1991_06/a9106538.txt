Abstract    :
              This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) award is to                   
              prepare detailed plans and protocols for university-based remote-              
              accessed MultiChip Module (MCM) testing services for universities.             
              Current MCM testing is proprietary, product specific, and without              
              university involvement.  This research contributes to the                      
              development of standard public domain processes that can be used               
              for prototype quantity testing of MCMs whose electrical, physical,             
              and test designs are done at universities.  Plans provide for                  
              testing of bare chips, bare substrate and assembled modules for                
              various assembly methods and degrees of testing automation.
