Abstract    :
                   In this project the principal investigator will continue his              
              fine work on problems that lie on the border between harmonic                  
              analysis and partial differential equations.  The main goal of                 
              his work is the description of harmonic measure for the exterior               
              of a convex domain.  A key question is to provide a bound on the               
              second variation of the electrostatic capacity that is analgous                
              to the Brunn-Minkowski inequality for the volume.  Other topics                
              for study are the behavior of nodal lines of eigenfunctions of                 
              free boundary problems, mixed boundary value problems in                       
              Lipschitz domains and L-p estimates for Airy-type operators.                   
                   The two subjects of harmonic analysis and partial                         
              differential equations figure prominently in the branch of                     
              mathematics known as classical analysis.  Indeed, harmonic                     
              analysis grew out of Fourier analysis, which was developed to                  
              help solve various types of partial differential equations.  In                
              this project the principal investigator will work on problems                  
              that span both of these areas.                                                 
                   In particular, he will try to describe the harmonic measure               
              of the exterior of a convex domain and he will study various                   
              types of boundary value problems using techniques from the theory              
              of harmonic functions.
