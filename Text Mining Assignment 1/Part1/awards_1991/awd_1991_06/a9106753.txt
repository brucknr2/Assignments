Abstract    :
                   This project supports work on finite and infinite groups and              
              their geometrical and combinatorial aspects.  The principal                    
              investigator will also examine lattices in Euclidean and hyperbolic            
              spaces, knots, games and related topics.                                       
                   This research is concerned with problems in combinatorics and             
              group theory.  In particular, the principal investigator will                  
              concentrate on a particularly remarkable group which is called the             
              Monster.  The outcome of this investigation is likely to impact                
              other areas of mathematics and physics.
