Abstract    :
                   This project will address questions in Analysis, Group                    
              Representation Theory, and Number Theory.  The part on Analysis                
              will include Radon transform, partial differential equations,                  
              Riemann surfaces, and scattering theory.  The part on group                    
              representations will be devoted to developing new techniques to                
              handle higher rank groups.  Finally, the part on number theory                 
              will encompass the Roger-Ramanujan identities, transcendental                  
              numbers and PDEs, and Euler series.                                            
                        This is an ambitious program designed to solve                       
              fundamental problems intertwined among various mathematical                    
              disciplines.
