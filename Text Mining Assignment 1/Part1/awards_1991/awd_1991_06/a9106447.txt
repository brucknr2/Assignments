Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research is aimed at understanding a recently discovered                  
              phenomenon of morphological instability in solid-solid phase                   
              transformations.  The geometry under study is the diffusion of a               
              thin metal film through an oxide layer into an underlying metal.               
              Interface instabilities may occur under these conditions leading to            
              microfacetting at the interface.  Experiments are designed to                  
              observe the transformation in copper films deposited onto aluminum             
              and test a working hypothesis developed to predict the results.                
              Hot stage transmission electron microscopy is employed to measure              
              instability wavelengths and oxide layer thicknesses.  Profilometer             
              measurements provide a check on the oxide layer thicknesses                    
              measured by microscopy.                                                        
              %%%                                                                            
              The results of this grant could impact important processes in                  
              technology, such as diffusion bonding of different materials and/or            
              reactions of substrates with thin metal films.
