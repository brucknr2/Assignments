Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The primary objective of this US-Bulgaria project                              
              between Dr. Alexander Ramm of Kansas State University                          
              and Dr. Plamen Stefanov, Institute of Mathematics of the                       
              Bulgarian Academy of Sciences is to study  several                             
              problems in applied mathematics and classical analysis.                        
              In particular the researchers plan to develop methods                          
              for the study of multidimensional inverse scattering                           
              problems and inverse backscattering problems.  The                             
              researchers' methods are based on the concept of                               
              property C for pairs of formal partial differential                            
              operators.  Data will be studied within the framework of                       
              exact theory.  The researchers plan to develop several                         
              applications of property C to the theory of multi-                             
              dimensional inverse problems.                                                  
                                                                                             
              This project in applied mathematics and classical                              
              analysis fulfills the program objective of advancing                           
              scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the                        
              United States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary                      
              talents and pool research resources in areas of strong                         
              mutual interest and competence.
