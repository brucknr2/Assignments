Abstract    :
                 Professor T.S. Lin is supported by a grant from the                         
              Experimental Physical Chemistry Program for the application of                 
              pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy.  This                     
              technique will be used to study the mechanisms of spin                         
              polarization transfer from electron spins to nuclear spins                     
              (Dynamic Nuclear Polarization processes) which invoke the                      
              photo-excited triplet states of organic solids.  Three aspects                 
              will be investigated:  resonance polarization transfer via the                 
              integrated solid effect, coherent polarization transfer via the                
              spin locking experiment, and electron-nuclear cross                            
              polarization dynamics at the level anticrossing region.  The                   
              results of these studies are expected to provide the                           
              information which will allow formulation of a theory of the                    
              resonance polarization transfer and the cross polarization                     
              processes in general.                                                          
              %%%                                                                            
              The enhancement of the proton nuclear magnetic resonance signal                
              in some organic solids can be as high as a factor of 15,000                    
              compared to the normal signal.  Such a large improvement in the                
              intensities of the proton signals could allow the studies of                   
              structures of guest molecules at low concentrations in these                   
              crystals.
