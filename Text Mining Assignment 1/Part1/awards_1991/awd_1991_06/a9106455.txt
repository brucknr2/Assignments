Abstract    :
                   When there is very little migration within a population of                
              living organisms, the distance between the birthplaces of                      
              individuals and the birthplaces of their parents is not much                   
              greater than the distance between neighbors.  Under these                      
              conditions different types of genes may become locally more or                 
              less common than average by purely random chance.  These random                
              genetic changes are very different from the nonrandom genetic                  
              changes brought about by natural selection that lead to adaptive               
              evolution.  However, random changes in the genetic composition of              
              local areas within a population can have a great impact on the                 
              specific evolutionary pathway along which a population is guided               
              by natural selection.  Therefore, to understand the types of                   
              evolutionary changes that may be brought about by natural                      
              selection, the importance of random changes must be determined.                
                   The investigators will study random genetic changes within                
              natural populations of two plant species that are native to the                
              tallgrass prairies of North America.  The extent to which                      
              different local areas within each study population have different              
              genetic compositions as a result of random changes will be                     
              measured.  Migration distances of pollen grains and seeds will                 
              also be measured to see if  the amount of random genetic change                
              is consistent with present migration patterns.  The information                
              on how genetic variation is distributed among different local                  
              areas will also be useful in establishing management guidelines                
              for the conservation of genetic diversity within the few                       
              remaining tracts of the once vast tallgrass prairie.
