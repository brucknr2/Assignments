Abstract    :
                   Many real-life situations can be modelled by a mixture                    
              model.  The investigator will derive robust estimates of                       
              parameters  of mixture models which have high efficiency.                      
                   The investigation will focus on minimum distance estimation               
              methods.  Theory and methods for the development of                            
              semiparametric mixture models will also be developed.
