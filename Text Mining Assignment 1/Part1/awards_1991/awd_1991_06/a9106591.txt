Abstract    :
                   A bottleneck can occur when a new population is established               
              from a few individuals.  Bottlenecks have been invoked as a                    
              mechanism in the formation of new species because they may                     
              dramatically modify mating behavior, but the specific effects of               
              bottlenecks on courtship repertoire have not been tested to                    
              confirm such a mode of speciation.  Recent studies have shown                  
              that traditional models are inadequate to predict bottleneck                   
              effects on genetic aspects of complex traits, such as body size                
              and survival.  The proposed study will apply classical                         
              quantitative genetic techniques currently employed for morphology              
              (i.e., statistical comparisons of body dimensions of parents and               
              offspring) to examine the effects of bottlenecks on courtship                  
              behavior.  Specifically, videotaped courtships of 100 families of              
              each of twelve strains that have undergone population bottlenecks              
              and four control lines of the housefly will be assayed for                     
              genetic variation and covariation of four courtship behaviors.                 
              These analyses will more clearly establish the efficacy of                     
              bottlenecks to alter the genetic properties of courtship elements              
              and the consequent potential of bottlenecks to catalyze                        
              speciation.  The successful management of endangered species                   
              critically depends upon such information for more thorough and                 
              accurate understanding of the effects of small population size on              
              the genetics of reproductive behavior.
