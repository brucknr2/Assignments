Abstract    :
                   Carlson will work on the following four problems and related              
              issues:                                                                        
                                                                                             
                   (1)  Do the strongly meager sets form an ideal?                           
                   (2)  How far along the inner model hierarchy do strong                    
                        covering lemmas hold?                                                
                   (3)  Is Fraisse's conjecture on models with many isomorphic               
                        substructures consistently false?                                    
                   (4)  Can the existence of medial limits be proved in set                  
                        theory?                                                              
                                                                                             
                   These are technical questions lying at the foundations of                 
              axiomatic set theory.  One wants to know under what assumptions                
              they are true, whether there are models of set theory in which                 
              they fail and others in which they hold.  It is subtle questions               
              such as these that allow us to explore the limits of the                       
              axiomatic systems upon which all of mathematics logically rests.
