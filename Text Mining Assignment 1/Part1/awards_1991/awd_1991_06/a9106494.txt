Abstract    :
                   It has been shown that large topographic features can have a              
              significant effect on atmospheric processes and hence the                      
              prediction of weather.                                                         
                   The Principal Investigators will perform                                  
              theoretical/numerical studies of atmospheric flows past                        
              three-dimensional topographical features.  Previous work will be               
              extended by allowing non-uniformity in the upstream                            
              stratification and airflow.                                                    
                   The research should lead to indications of critical                       
              atmospheric factors responsible for various flow features around               
              mountains including flow-splitting, formation of shearlines and                
              generation of lee vortices.
