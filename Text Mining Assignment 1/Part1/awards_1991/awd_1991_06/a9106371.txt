Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Politics is fundamentally about aggregation.  Organizing diverse               
              elements into stable and enduring coalitions is a central concern              
              of political activity.  Political parties attempt to forge enduring            
              coalitions of interests across multiple social cleavages. Nations              
              pursue alliances for mutual security.  Legislatures organize so as             
              to facilitate the development of majority coalitions that can enact            
              legislation.  To date, however, separate theories of political                 
              aggregation have been developed for each of the various aspects of             
              politics in which aggregation is of concern.  This important                   
              research attempts to develop a general theory of aggregation which             
              can account for the organizational dynamics of diverse social                  
              systems.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              Specifically, this research uses concepts from the physical                    
              sciences and biology to develop and test a formal model of                     
              aggregation called landscape theory.  It seeks to develop a                    
              relatively simple model that has wide applications to a variety of             
              aggregation problems including international alliances, coalitions             
              of political parties, social networks, and social cleavages in                 
              democracies among many others.  The research will proceed in                   
              phases. It will begin by elaborating the theory adding complexity              
              and realism.  It will proceed to distill general principles of                 
              aggregation from across the several applications.  Finally, it will            
              test the theory with data for each of the applications.                        
                                                                                             
              When completed this research should greatly enhance our                        
              understanding of the dynamics of aggregation in politics.
