Abstract    :
              Seven projects devoted to determining the reactivity of                        
              dioxygen species and means of activating them will be pursued.                 
              These are: I) activation of peroxides by iron and cobalt                       
              complexes, II) activation of dioxygen by iron complexes, III)                  
              ligand centered redox reactions of metal complexes, IV) the                    
              chemistry of superoxide, V) development of a model for the heme                
              containing component of cytochrome c oxidase, VI) development                  
              of a model for the manganese cofactor of photosystem II, and                   
              VII) the characterization of the nucleophilicity of peroxides                  
              towards electrophilic centers such as sulfur dioxide, chlorine,                
              and chlorinated, aromatic hydrocarbons.

              In this project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organo-                    
              metallic Program of the Chemistry Division, Dr. Donald T.                      
              Sawyer of Texas A&M University will continue studies of the                    
              reactivity and activation of oxygen, superoxide, and peroxides.                
              This work will increase our understanding of such diverse                      
              topics as biological oxidation, combustion processes, and                      
              decontamination of some environmentally hazardous chemicals                    
              such as chlorinated hydrocarbons.
