Abstract    :
                   The emergence of the Central American isthmus (approximately              
              3.5 Ma) presents an ideal natural experiment for testing the causal            
              basis of the rates and mechanisms of evolutionary change of marine             
              organisms.  This event isolated previously contiguous populations              
              in the eastern Pacific and Caribbean, and initiated the development            
              of different selective regimes on opposing sides of the barrier.               
              Molluscan stable isotopic profiles can provide an excellent record             
              of ambient environmental conditions.  In particular, molluscan                 
              isotopic profiles record the contrasting patterns of seasonal                  
              change in temperature, salinity, and upwelling that characterize               
              the eastern Pacific and southwestern Caribbean today.  Stable                  
              isotopic analyses will be conducted for selected mollusc shells                
              from extensive and well-dated Plio-Pleistocene sections on either              
              side of the Central American isthmus.  The purpose of these                    
              analyses is to: 1) track the development of the differences between            
              eastern Pacific and Caribbean environments, and 2) provide a                   
              paleoenvironmental context for future evolutionary studies of                  
              marine invertebrate taxa.
