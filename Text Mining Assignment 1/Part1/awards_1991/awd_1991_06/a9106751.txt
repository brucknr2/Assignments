Abstract    :
                   This awards supports the research of Professor I. Dolgachev               
              as principal investigator and Dr. V. Lunts as a postdoctoral                   
              associate to work in algebraic geometry.  Professor Dolgachev                  
              will study the Scorza invariant of curves in projective space, as              
              well as the connection between certain hypergeometric functions                
              and moduli spaces.  Dr. Lunts will work on characteristic                      
              varieties of Verma modules on flag varieties, the hard Lefschetz               
              theorem and the cohomology of toric varieties.                                 
                   This research is in the field of algebraic geometry, one of               
              the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which blossomed                
              to the point where it has, in the past 10 years, solved problems               
              that have stood for centuries.  Originally, it treated figures                 
              defined in the plane by the simplest of equations, namely                      
              polynomials.  Today, the field uses methods not only from                      
              algebra, but also from analysis and topology, and conversely it                
              is extensively used in those fields.  Moreover, it has proved                  
              itself useful in fields as diverse as physics, theoretical                     
              computer science, cryptography, coding theory and robotics.
