Abstract    :
                   Paleomagnetic vector data from granite plutons are commonly               
              robust and well-clustered, unlike paleomagnetic data from deformed             
              sedimentary rocks.  However,  because no paleohorizontal references            
              plane (such as bedding in layered rocks) is available in most                  
              plutons, their use in tectonic reconstructions has been severely               
              limited because any proposed latitudinal translation can just as               
              easily be explained by in situ tilting of the pluton.  This                    
              ambiguity has led to a major controversy concerning whether or not             
              some Tertiary plutons in the pacific northwest originated near                 
              Baja, California and subsequently moved north to their present                 
              position, or formed near their present position and were then                  
              tilted.  This project will examine one of these plutons and use a              
              widely-applicable pressure indicator (Aluminum in hornblende) to               
              calculate a paleohorizontal plane for the pluton.  Successful                  
              results will not only provide a resolution of the "Baja-BC"                    
              controversy, but more importantly would demonstrate the potential              
              to obtain paleohorizontal reference planes for plutons in general.
