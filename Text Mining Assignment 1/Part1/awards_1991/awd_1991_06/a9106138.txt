Abstract    :
                   The assembly of continental crust into large continental                  
              cratons typically involves several continent-continent collisions.             
              Relatively shallow level parts of such collisions can be addressed             
              in active or young system such as the Himalaya, however, deep                  
              portions are only exposed in ancient orogens.  This project, a                 
              collaboration between Syracuse University and University of                    
              California, Santa Cruz, will investigate the crustal evolution of              
              the Archaean Rae-Hearne platform and the bounding Snowbird Tectonic            
              zone in northeastern Saskatchewan to document Archean and early                
              Proterozoic crustal growth and to evaluate the effect of terminal              
              collision within the orogen at 1.8 Ga.  Because approximately 20               
              km of crust has bee removed by uplift and erosion, a view of mid-              
              crustal levels of orogeny will be directly studied.  Results are               
              expected to help understand not only Archean events in the Trans-              
              Hudson orogen but also deeper parts of compressional tectonic                  
              settings generally.
