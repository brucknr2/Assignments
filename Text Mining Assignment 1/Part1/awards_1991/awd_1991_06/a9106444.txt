Abstract    :
                   This project is concerned with a number of issues in algebraic            
              geometry, the geometric theory of noncommutative rings, the                    
              differential topology of complex algebraic varieties, and                      
              arithmetic algebraic geometry.  These issues include the following:            
              (1) the enumeration of the multiple-points of a finite map that is             
              birational onto its image; (2) Whitney equisingularity and the                 
              Buchsbaum-Rim multiplicity; (3) the inseparablility of the Gauss               
              map of a smooth complete interaction; (4) the enumeration of the               
              rational normal curves on the generic quintic hypersurface in                  
              4-space, and the singularity of the Hilbert scheme component of the            
              rational normal n-ics; (5) the autoduality of the compactified                 
              Jacobian; (6) the theory of a transition map in the theory of                  
              residues and duality; (7) quantum projective planes; (8) the                   
              foundations of noncommutative projective geometry; (9)                         
              noncommutative projective schemes of dimension 1; (10) maximal                 
              orders with p-fold ramification in characteristic p; (11) special              
              polyhedral filtrations; (12) higher Chow groups as derived                     
              functors; (13) bivariant sheaves and motives; (14) applications of             
              geometry to the study of class groups of number fields.                        
                   This is research in the field of algebraic geometry, which is             
              one of the oldest parts of modern mathematics.  In its origin, it              
              treated figures that could be defined in the plane by the simplest             
              equations, namely polynomials.  Nowadays the field makes use of                
              methods not only from algebra, but also from analysis and topology.            
              It is finding application in those areas of mathematics as well as             
              in theoretical computer science and in robotics.
