Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              There are several species of weakly electric fishes that                       
              produce small repetitive discharges from their electric organs,                
              and assess objects in their environment by monitoring distortions              
              of the electric field that they produce.  Studies of the                       
              physiology and behavior of these electrosensory systems have                   
              revealed principles of neuronal coding and processing of                       
              information which also characterize systems such as vision and                 
              audition in other vertebrates.                                                 
                                                                                             
              This work concentrates on groups of nerve cells, called                        
              nuclei, in a central region of the brain called the diencephalon,              
              which lies just in front of the midbrain region.  Studies have                 
              already shown that the diencephalic nuclei, unlike those in the                
              midbrain, contain neurons dedicated to the generation of specific              
              behaviors by the whole fish in using its electric organ                        
              discharge.  This study will investigate the structure, function,               
              and interconnections of these neurons from different nuclei using              
              a variety of physiological and anatomical tracing techniques.                  
              Behaviorally relevant stimulus paradigms will be used to test the              
              response properties of individual neurons along pathways involved              
              in control of specific behavioral responses.  This fruitful model              
              system will generate results important to a range of sensory                   
              sciences, to behavior, and to computational neuroscience.
