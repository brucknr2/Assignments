Abstract    :
                   The use of in-situ produced cosmogenic helium to measure                  
              surface exposure ages has many applications in the earth sciences.             
              Because 3He is stable and has a high production rate (by cosmic                
              ray spallation), it can be used to measure the ages of both young              
              (~ kyr) and old (~myr) surfaces.  However, there are a number of               
              important problems that must be addressed.  Most important, it is              
              critical to have accurate determination of the production rate as              
              a function of latitude, altitude and depth and time.  The                      
              acquisition of new data from young radiocarbon dated lava flows                
              will help constrain the reason for the apparent 3He production rate            
              changes during the last 10 ka (which may be partly due to dipole               
              moment fluctuations).  In addition, it is critical to know                     
              diffusion rates to assess the importance of diffusive helium loss.             
              This proposal seeks funds to address these problems with new                   
              measurements of dated lava flows and glacial moraines, production              
              rate experiments, and diffusion measurements.  The combination of              
              field work and laboratory experiments proposed is critical to                  
              evaluating the precision of the technique, the basic assumptions               
              involved, and for developing surface exposure dating for use in                
              geomorphology, glacial geology, volcanology, and archaeology.
