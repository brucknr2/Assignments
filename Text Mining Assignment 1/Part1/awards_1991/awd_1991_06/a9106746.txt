Abstract    :
              Biologists have long been interested in reconstructing the history             
              of life, and there are many procedures that have been used to                  
              provide such reconstructions.  However, there are almost no                    
              examples in which the phylogeny is known in advance, whereby the               
              reconstruction methods can be tested directly.  In this study,                 
              viruses (T7 bacteriophage) will be grown in the laboratory in the              
              presence of a mutagen to generate known phylogenies, DNA sequence              
              information will be obtained from the resultant lineages, and these            
              data will be used to test methods of phylogeny reconstruction.                 
              Experiments will consider (i) the effect of the shape of the tree              
              (branching structure and branch lengths) on the accuracy of                    
              reconstruction methods, (ii) the effect of environment of molecular            
              convergence, and (iii) constancy of rates of molecular change.  The            
              data gathered will be DNA sequences and restriction enzyme cleavage            
              sites of the viral genome.  This study will impact the field of                
              systematic biology both in establishing an empirical methodology               
              for experimental phylogeny construction and in providing direct                
              tests of phylogenetic inference methodology.  These phylogenetic               
              methods have become increasingly important to many fields of                   
              biology.  Preliminary data have been collected to demonstrate both             
              the technical feasibility of the study and the utility of the                  
              system for these objectives.
