Abstract    :
                   Experiments are carried out to probe the competition between              
              ionization and dissociation in highly excited small molecules.                 
              The analysis of data includes a calculation of statistical                     
              covariance between all the fragments (both ions and electrons),                
              which allows identification of specific collision partners and                 
              the transition state of their parent molecular systems.                        
              Experiments are performed with long (15 ns) and short (10 ps)                  
              pulsed 193 nm radiation at power densities between 1 GW/cm2 and                
              100 TW/cm2.  At the lower intensities, the effects of resonant                 
              bound and unbound intermediate states on this competition are                  
              studies.  At higher intensities the details of Coulomb explosions              
              and above threshold dissociation are studied in diatomic systems.
