Abstract    :
              Analytical equipment for                                                       
              molecular/cellular bioengineering                                              
              research is to be provided by this                                             
              award.  A spectrofluorometer and a                                             
              scintillation counter will be used                                             
              for quantitation of specific                                                   
              macromolecules inside cells, on                                                
              cell surfaces, and on solid                                                    
              substrates.  A Coulter counter will                                            
              be used to obtain statistically                                                
              significant measurements of cell                                               
              numbers with high sample                                                       
              throughout.  Each of these                                                     
              instruments is necessary to provide                                            
              essential data for at least three                                              
              of five ongoing research projects.
