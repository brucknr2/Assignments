Abstract    :
              An experimental research program will be undertaken                            
              to realize in the laboratory the process of photon                             
              duplication, a novel process in which the photon                               
              statistics of an input beam of light is duplicated into                        
              two output beams, one of which can be measured                                 
              while leaving the other for further manipulation.                              
              This process is of interest from a number of                                   
              standpoints that are both fundamental and applied.                             
              Fundamentally, photon duplication is a phenomenon                              
              that has never been observed; it requires quantum-                             
              optic experimentation in a regime that has never                               
              been explored.  It also leads to novel quantum                                 
              nondemolition detection strategies that are efficient                          
              and do not require largepump power or explicit                                 
              phase-sensitive measurements.  From an applied                                 
              standpoint, a photon duplicator can be used in a                               
              communication network as a transparent optical tap.                            
              Specifically, we propose to analyze the detailed                               
              physics of photon duplication and to perform an                                
              experiment that will demonstrate the process.  A                               
              four-wave mixing experiment will be carried out in a                           
              regime where photon duplication is predicted to                                
              occur.  A platelet of CdTe, pumped by a mode-                                  
              locked and Q-switched Nd:YAG laser, will be used as                            
              the nonlinear medium.  CdTe is chosen because it                               
              has been shown to have a large third-order                                     
              nonlinearity with a sub-nanosecond response time.                              
              Photon correlations will be measured using a novel                             
              pulsed shot-noise detection scheme that we have                                
              developed.  In addition, we will investigate avenues                           
              toward implementation of the process of photon                                 
              duplication in nonlinear optical waveguides.
