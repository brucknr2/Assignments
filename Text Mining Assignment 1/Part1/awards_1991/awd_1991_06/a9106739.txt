Abstract    :
                   This project supports research in commutative algebra and                 
              algebraic geometry.  The principal investigators will study                    
              torsion-free, projective and Cohen-Macaulay modules over affine                
              rings and their localizations; prime ideal structure of                        
              two-dimensional affine domains; and Hilbert functions and reduction            
              numbers of primary ideals in Cohen-Macaulay local rings.  They will            
              also consider automorphism groups of rational surfaces; ideal                  
              theoretic questions of embedded rational surfaces; and the                     
              set-theoretic complete intersection problem for curves in                      
              projective 3-space.                                                            
                   Algebraic geometry is the study of the geometric objects                  
              arising from the sets of zeros of systems of polynomial equations.             
              This is one of the oldest and currently one of the most active                 
              branches of mathematics.  It has widespread applications in                    
              mathematics, computer science and physics.
