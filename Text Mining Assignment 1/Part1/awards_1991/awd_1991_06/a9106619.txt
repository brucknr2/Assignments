Abstract    :
              It is proposed an experimental study on the electrostatic                      
              atomization of aerosols with controlled size distribution in                   
              the range between 0.05 to several microns.  The objective is                   
              to determine the conditions required for monodispersity,                       
              establish the scaling law for particle change and mass, and                    
              identify the fundamental mechanisms.  It is expected that a                    
              representative set of experimental data will be obtained in an                 
              unexplored region of electrostatic spraying.  Physical                         
              insights and possible concepts  for the development of the                     
              electrospray technology are targeted.  The results from this                   
              project may be of use in analytical chemistry, cluster                         
              physics, materials processing and electronics fabrication.
