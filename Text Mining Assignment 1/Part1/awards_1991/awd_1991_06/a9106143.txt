Abstract    :
              The Department of Mathematics at the University of Pennsylvania                
              will purchase computer equipment which will be dedicated to                    
              support research in the Mathematical Sciences.  The equipment                  
              will be used for several research projects, including in                       
              particular that of Jim Lipton on automated deduction and                       
              realizability, Eugene Lerman on some problems in symplectic                    
              geometry, that of various junior faculty on projects in number                 
              theory, Lie algebras, combinatorics, differential geometry, and                
              partial differential equations, and that of various graduate                   
              students on research projects on similar topics.
