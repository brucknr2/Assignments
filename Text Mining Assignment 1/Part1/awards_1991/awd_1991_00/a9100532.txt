Abstract    :
              This renewal award is made in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and                  
              Organometallic Chemistry Program in support of the research of                 
              Dr. Daniel Nocera. The thrust of the research is the                           
              photo-driven, two-electron oxidation-reduction reaction between                
              metal centers in binuclear transition metal complexes. The                     
              research will include the synthesis of quadruply-bonded                        
              tungsten and molybdenum complexes, mixed-valence binuclear                     
              rhodium complexes, and layered vanadium and niobium phosphates                 
              intercalated with dimolybdenum and dirhodium cores.                            
              Photoexcited intermediates will be characterized by picosecond                 
              and nanosecond time-resolved excited-state spectroscopy with                   
              the ultimate objective of understanding the mechanisms of                      
              multi-electron processes.

              Some of the chemical systems to be studied in this project are                 
              appropriate to energy-converting multi-electron transformations                
              such as splitting hydrogen chloride into hydrogen and chlorine,                
              while other systems will be used to prepare novel photoactive                  
              layered solids possessing multi-electron reactivity.
