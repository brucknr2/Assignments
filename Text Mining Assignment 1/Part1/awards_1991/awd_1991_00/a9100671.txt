Abstract    :
                   In this project the principal investigators will study the                
              geometric properties of harmonic measure; in particular, they                  
              will focus on the relations between harmonic measure on domains                
              in the plane and one-dimensional Hausdorff measure.  The                       
              principal investigators will also look into problems involving                 
              harmonic measure and analytic capacity, the relationship between               
              rectifiable sets and harmonic measure, and the estimation of                   
              eigenvalues of the Laplace operator on subdomains of the sphere                
              in higher dimensions.                                                          
                   The principal investigators are interested in studying the                
              relationship between an analytical quantity known as the harmonic              
              measure of a set and the geometry of this set.  Harmonic measure               
              is an important and useful concept that arises in probability                  
              theory and complex function theory.  In this project the                       
              principal investigators will seek to characterize properties of                
              the harmonic measure of a set in terms of geometric properties of              
              the set such as its Hausdorff dimension.
