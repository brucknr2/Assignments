Abstract    :
                   This grant to a University of Washington faculty member                   
              will support an extension of measurements of the neutron                       
              electric dipole moment using cold neutron beams at the                         
              Institut von Laue-Langevan High Flux Reactor.  The measurement                 
              is of fundamental importance in establishing limits to parity                  
              and time reversal symmetry violation.  In addition,                            
              measurements will be undertaken to study the parity violating                  
              interaction of neutrons with helium nuclei by measuring the                    
              parity nonconserving neutron spin rotation in a liquid helium                  
              target.
