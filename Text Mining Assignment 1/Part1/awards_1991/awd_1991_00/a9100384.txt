Abstract    :
                 This is a Conference grant award to provide partial travel                  
              assistance for five postdoctoral fellows and graduate students to              
              attend the International Meeting on Gap Junctions, to be held on               
              June 9-13, 1991 at Asilomar Conference Center, Pacific Grove,                  
              California.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              This will be the fourth in a series of major comprehensive meetings            
              on gap junctions to be held since 1984, and the most recent since              
              1989.  The field of gap junctions has expanded enormously in the               
              past two years, and therefore this meeting is timely and important.
