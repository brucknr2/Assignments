Abstract    :
                   In this project the principal investigator and a graduate                 
              student will work on several interesting problems involving                    
              partial differential equations that arise in various                           
              applications. Among other things, they will study ill-posed                    
              problems, St. Venant and Phragmen-Lindelof problems, stability                 
              questions for nonlinear systems and overdetermined problems.                   
              This work will be characterized by a deft use of analytical                    
              techniques such as a' priori estimates and maximum principles to               
              derive sharp bounds on physically relevant quantities that are                 
              described by ill-posed problems.                                               
                   Important physical phenomena are described by what are                    
              called "ill-posed" problems, to which the tried and true methods               
              of mathematics often do not apply.  These are problems that can                
              have more than one solution or no solution at all and whose                    
              solutions, if they exist, exhibit strange behavior.  Most                      
              problems in partial differential equations are "well-posed", by                
              which mathematicians mean that there is a unique solution that                 
              depends continuously on the data of the problem.  In this project              
              the principal investigator and a graduate student will apply                   
              mathematical methods to study the behavior of solutions of ill-                
              posed problems that come from physics and engineering.
