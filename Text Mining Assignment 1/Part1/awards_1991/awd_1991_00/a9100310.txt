Abstract    :
                   This project is concerned with the modular representation                 
              theory of finite groups over a field of finite characteristic p and            
              in particular, the relations with the p-local structure of the                 
              group.  The principal investigator will study perfect isometries,              
              a recent concept introduced by Broue.  This links invariants of                
              block algebras of finite groups with the derived categories of                 
              block algebras.  The configurations in classical Chevalley groups              
              connected with the Alperin conjecture will also be studied, as well            
              as, the classification of blocks in finite Chevalley groups.                   
                   This research is in the general area of the representation                
              theory of finite classical groups.  One of the main applications of            
              group theory to other mathematical and scientific fields is in                 
              representation theory, and finite classical groups are a primary               
              source of finite simple groups.
