Abstract    :
                   This project is concerned with the study of verbally                      
              prime p.i. algebras.  These algebras are basic building blocks                 
              in the theory of T-ideals.  The principal investigator will                    
              study the structure of generic models, embedding theorems, and                 
              applications of invariant theory.                                              
                   This research is in the general area of noncommutative                    
              ring theory.  In particular, it is concerned with a class of                   
              rings which satisfy a polynomial equation.  This area, with                    
              the discovery of combinatorial theorems that provide insight                   
              into the structure theory of the algebra, has become an                        
              exciting topic of current research in ring theory with                         
              implications for representation theory.
