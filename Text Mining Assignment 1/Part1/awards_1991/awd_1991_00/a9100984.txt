Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Undergraduate students will be involved in the research activities             
              of the radio astronomy group at Cornell University.  The                       
              undergraduate students will work directly with members of the                  
              Cornell faculty and research staff on projects covering a range of             
              disciplines in radio, infrared, and radar astronomy, and related               
              theoretical topics.  Many students will participate in observations            
              at one of the facilities used by Cornell scientists in their                   
              research.  Some will use the supercomputing resources available at             
              Cornell.  The students will conduct individual research projects               
              and also participate in group activities such as seminars.                     
              Attempts will be made to encourage participation by students at                
              undergraduate institutions, by women and by minority students.                 
              This program will be a continuation of the undergraduate program               
              established in the summers of 1989 and 1990.
