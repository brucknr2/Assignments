Abstract    :
              This award provides funds to the Biology Department of Furman                  
              University to establish a Research Experiences for Undergraduates              
              SITE.  With this support the department will recruit talented                  
              women and minority students, rising juniors studying biology at                
              neighboring institutions in South Carolina, and extend to them                 
              the benefits of this NSF-REU program.  Student groups of two or                
              three will work closely with each faculty member in full-time                  
              summer laboratory research.  The student-faculty research                      
              projects span many of the sub-curricula of the department,                     
              including gene expression studies in seed development,                         
              immunocytological studies on phytochrome activity in plant                     
              development, isoenzyme studies in plants, ultraviolet absorbing                
              and fluorescing molecules in insects, isolation of active                      
              compounds in plant defense mechanisms,                                         
              community ecology, and neurobiology.  In the selection process                 
              faculty mentors will be matched with appropriate student co-                   
              workers.  Student participants will submit a formal written                    
              summary of their summer's accomplishments.  A regular schedule of              
              special scientific, social, and athletic events will round out                 
              the program and provide an added mechanism for developing esprit               
              de corps among the diverse group of participants.
