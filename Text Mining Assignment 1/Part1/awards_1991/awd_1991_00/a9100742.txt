Abstract    :
              Professor Ronald G. Lawler and other members of the Chemistry                  
              Department at Brown University are being supported to conduct                  
              an Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in                       
              Chemistry.  For the period 1991-93, eight undergraduate                        
              students will spend ten weeks each summer actively engaged in a                
              variety of research projects.  Projects range from study of                    
              analytical techniques such as laser-photoacoustic trace                        
              detection and crystallography to biochemical studies of                        
              coenzyme A using NMR and biosynthesis of terpenes.  At the                     
              conclusion of the program, each student will prepare a written                 
              report and give a poster presentation at a session attended by                 
              all members of the Chemistry Department.
