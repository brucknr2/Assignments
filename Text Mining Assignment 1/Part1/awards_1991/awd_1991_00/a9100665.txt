Abstract    :
                   In automated deduction, the project involves the computer                 
              verification of proofs of mathematical theorems.  It addresses                 
              the problem of automatically generating proofs of individual                   
              lemmas, and also sets forth a general framework for verifying                  
              large fragments of mathematics through a development of axiomatic              
              set theory.                                                                    
                   In logic programming, the project considers Prolog-style                  
              languages.  These derive from logic, but there are serious                     
              questions about their semantics, and there are several divergent               
              points of view on what a logic program "should" mean.  The goal                
              is to clean up the semantics, while still maintaining Prolog's                 
              efficiency as a programming language.                                          
                   In set theory and topology, three topics of research are                  
              planned.  (1) Homogeneity properties of compact spaces. (2)                    
              Real-valued measurable cardinals; recent advances by Gitik and                 
              Shelah make it reasonable to reconsider some old questions in                  
              this area. (3) Martin's Axiom (MA) and uncountable cardinals                   
              below the continuum.  Specifically, the investigator would like                
              to find models where MA first fails at a singular cardinal of                  
              cofinality greater than omega-one and would like to discover                   
              consistent PFA-style axioms which allow the continuum to be                    
              greater than omega-two.                                                        
                   This project thus involves several apparently unrelated                   
              areas, logic programming and proof verification on the one hand                
              and set theoretic topology on the other hand.  The former has a                
              more obvious relation to practical problems of computer science,               
              but the underlying connection is through the habits of mind                    
              cultivated by long study of mathematical logic.
