Abstract    :
                   A summer program for undergraduates will be held at the                   
              University of Colorado-Boulder.  The students will work on the                 
              various research programs now underway in the Physics                          
              Department, and will meet as a group to discuss their                          
              experience and progress.  NSF support is highly recommended.
