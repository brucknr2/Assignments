Abstract    :
              This is the first year of a three-year continuing award.  The                  
              research is to study computational complexity of adaptive and                  
              robust robot motion planning algorithms which can be effective in              
              situations with incomplete information or in dynamically-changing              
              environments.  The planner's performance is to adapt as new                    
              information is acquired or the environment changes.  The research              
              will also consider movement problems with inherent errors in the               
              sensing and movement control, so that the motion planning                      
              algorithms must be robust to lack of information on the position               
              of the robot.  The emphasis is on the design of algorithms that                
              give provable optimal or near-optimal performance, focusing                    
              especially on some less-investigated motion planning problems.                 
              The use of massive parallelism will be explored, to speed up the               
              movement planning algorithms.  The results should contribute to a              
              more fundamental understanding of the nature of motion planning                
              problems, and ultimately to more robust planning approaches for                
              less structured environments.
