Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research is aimed at developing a better understanding of ion             
              beam-assisted deposition to produce useful coatings on metal                   
              alloys.  Of particular interest are the effects of several process             
              variables on the mechanical behavior of the coated materials.  Film            
              morphology, composition, and geometry are controlled to optimize               
              film properties.  Emphasis is on improved fracture toughness while             
              maintaining oxidation resistance by creating alternating oxide                 
              (alumina) and metal (aluminum) layers.  Mechanical properties are              
              determined by the ultra-low load indentation method, tensile                   
              testing, four-point bending, and indentation-fracture techniques.              
              The structure of the microlaminates is correlated with the                     
              processing parameters and mechanical properties.
