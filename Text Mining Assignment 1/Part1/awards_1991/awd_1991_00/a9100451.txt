Abstract    :
              The Graduate School of Oceanography at University of Rhode                     
              Island will receive support for shipboard technician                           
              activities associated with the research vessel ENDEAVOR,                       
              a 177-foot research vessel that is owned by the NSF and                        
              operated by the University.  A significant portion of the                      
              ship's operating schedule in recent years and again in 1991                    
              is in support of NSF-sponsored research projects.  The                         
              Shipboard Technician Program has two components: an at-sea                     
              component and an ashore component.                                             
                                                                                             
              The at-sea component consists of instructing scientific                        
              personnel in the use of shared shipboard equipment; main-                      
              tenance, repair, and calibration of scientific instru-                         
              mentation; instruction and supervision of deck operations;                     
              and providing logistics assistance to on-coming and off-going                  
              scientific parties.  On shore activities include the mainten-                  
              ance, repair, and calibration of shared use seagoing equip-                    
              ment and assisting scientific personnel in preparing for                       
              field work on the vessel.  Shipboard technicians funded by                     
              this award have broad responsibilities for providing the                       
              coordination and assistance needed for the successful                          
              completion of research projects at sea.  The level of                          
              activity and amount of support are closely related to the                      
              size and capability of the vessel, and its scientific outfit                   
              and capability.
