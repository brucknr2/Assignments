Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This project investigates the developmental course of social              
              action groups.  It tests propositions from classical social                    
              theory about the natural course of development from spontaneous                
              and relatively unorganized groups to bureaucratic organizations                
              with rules and defined official responsibilities.   PIs sent                   
              questionnaires to about 370 such organizations active in 1986,                 
              and plan to interview their leaders and analyze printed material               
              in the course of this research.  Results will help establish                   
              whether the predicted bureaucratization is universal or whether                
              certain conditions modify its course.
