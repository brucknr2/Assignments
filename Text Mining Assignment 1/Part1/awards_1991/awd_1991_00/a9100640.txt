Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A Research Experiences for Undergraduates project will be                      
              supported by this award.  Ten students will work on problems of                
              mathematical analysis under the direction of two faculty                       
              advisors.  The principal investigator and the visiting faculty                 
              member were both heavily involved with the REU program conducted               
                                                                                             
              last year at TSU.  Again too, there will be joint activities with              
                                                                                             
              the University of Houston.  Included will be a weekly visit to                 
              the UH campus to access the facilities of the Nonlinear Dynamics               
                                                                                             
              Laboratory.  In addition, a Careers Day and panel discussion                   
              will be repeated.  Visitors from the surrounding community such                
              as Exxon and the Johnson Space Center as well as other academic                
              institutions will meet with students to discuss career                         
              opportunities.                                                                 
                                                                                             
              The research will focus on two primary topics.  These are                      
              oscillation theory of ordinary differential equations and                      
              iterating of mappings and chaos, sometimes referred to as                      
              discrete dynamical systems.  These topics are particularly good;               
                                                                                             
              one can involve students almost immediately with important and                 
              intelligible problems with a strong geometric flavor.                          
                                                                                             
              Students will be encouraged to prepare reports on their                        
              accomplishments and present them at professional meetings.  In                 
              particular, they will be invited to attend the annual meeting of               
                                                                                             
              the Research Association of Minority Professors held each year in
