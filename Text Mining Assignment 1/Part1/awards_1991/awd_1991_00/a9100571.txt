Abstract    :
              This award provides funds to establish a Research Experiences for              
              Undergraduates Site program in the Department of Biological                    
              Sciences at the University of Missouri-Columbia to provide                     
              research opportunities for students from other institutions.  The              
              Department will work in partnership with a select group of                     
              undergraduate institutions, including predominantly minority                   
              institutions, to provide students with the kind of research                    
              experience only available at a major comprehensive research                    
              university.  This REU program will complement an internship                    
              program for MU students funded through a grant from the Howard                 
              Hughes Medical Institute.  Faculty participant's research                      
              programs center on the theme "Cellular, Molecular and Genetic                  
              Approaches to Biological Problems," and utilize methodology                    
              raging from recombinant DNA technology, to immunocytochemistry,                
              to sophisticated electrophysiology.  All participating faculty                 
              are personally involved in their research projects, are well-                  
              funded, and have a history of successful partnerships with                     
              undergraduates interns.  While the research experience is the                  
              cornerstone of the summer program,  multiple and varied                        
              opportunities for the students to develop their communication                  
              skills, and the opportunity to present their research at local                 
              and regional scientific meetings will be provided.  Finally, a                 
              number of enrichment activities including seminars by research                 
              faculty, an informal evening program "Science and Scientists,"                 
              and a panel discussion on selecting and applying to graduate                   
              schools have been developed.
