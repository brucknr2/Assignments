Abstract    :
              Eight undergraduate students from the Southwest Rocky Mountain Region          
              will participate in a ten-week, comprehensive research experience at the       
              University of New Mexico during the summer of 1991.  In accordance with        
              his/her interests, each student will do one of the following: 1)               
              participate in the design, construction and operation of a small-scale         
              permeable barrier for groundwater aquifer remediation; 2) investigate          
              fracture in rock and concrete using laser interferometry; 3) conduct           
              nondestructive test methods on small structural components; 4) join in         
              an exciting development of a new fast-scan Scanning Electron Microscope;       
              5) design a Lunar optical telescope using interactive graphical                
              analysis; 6) assist in an experiment to understand microcracking of            
              solids using a UNM x-ray device; 7) assist in numerical simulations of         
              granular soil using a discrete element model involving 2D discs and 3D         
              quartz spheres; and 8) study idealized failure profiles of soil-               
              structure interactions through video imaging.  Over half of the students       
              will be selected from applicants at institutions other than UNM,               
              especially those without active research programs.  Women, minority and        
              handicapped applicants particularly will be recruited.  The students           
              will become familiar with their projects through early contact with the        
              research faculty.  Each student can expect to learn to work quite              
              independently over the course of the summer, will present a final              
              seminar on the research, and will assist in writing a publication              
              describing the work.
