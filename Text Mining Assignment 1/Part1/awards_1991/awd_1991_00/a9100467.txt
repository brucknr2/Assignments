Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The objective of the study is to test the validity of a                        
              mechanistic model of magma generation under mid ocean ridges by                
              trace element analyses of primitive mid ocean ridge (MORB)                     
              glasses. This will be accomplished through the study of MORB                   
              samples from the Carlsberg Ridge, the East Pacific Rise near the               
              Siqueiros Fracture Zone and the Southern Mid Atlantic Ridge.                   
              Isotopes study of MORB glasses are also planned. At the                        
              conclusion of the analyses melt fractions at advanced stage of                 
              the process.
