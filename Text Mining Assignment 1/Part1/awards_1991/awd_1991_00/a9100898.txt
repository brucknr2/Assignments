Abstract    :
                   This project will support 10 students to work on a                        
              variety of projects in computer vision utilizing researchers                   
              from the University of Central Florida, the University of                      
              South Florida, and Stetson College.  The student participants                  
              engage in a intensive 12 week summer program which includes a                  
              6-week course in computer vision, followed by two short                        
              courses in programing, followed by 4 weeks of research.  The                   
              research component is continued throughout the following                       
              academic year.  Students work in a variety of areas such as                    
              combining stereo and shape from shading, neural controllers                    
              for robotic arms, range image aspect graphs, and modeling of                   
              non-rigid object motion.            //
