Abstract    :
              It is known that the freezing of saline soils or of soils                      
              saturated with herbicides, fertilizers or various contaminants                 
              may result in the exclusion and concentration of the solute or                 
              contaminant at the freezing front.  Solidification of                          
              industrial coatings and ingots is also associated with                         
              segregation at the freezing front, dendritic crystal growth,                   
              the formation of a mushy zone, and density-driven convection,                  
              suggesting that an analogy exist between the freezing of                       
              saline soils and the solidification of castings.  In castings,                 
              the redistribution of the solute by the interdendritic liquid                  
              flow causes nonuniformities (segregation) in alloy composition                 
              and affects the physical and mechanical properties.                            
                                                                                             
              This research proposal outlines a fundamental study of flow                    
              and heat transfer processes in a system involving the                          
              solidification of salt solutions in a porous medium.  A                        
              rectangular test cell containing an aqueous salt solution and                  
              metallic or nonmetallic spheres with solidification beginning                  
              at one vertical wall would be studied.  Specifically this                      
              research project will 1) record the transient and spatial                      
              variation of temperature within the system, 2)                                 
              photographically record the freezing process to provide                        
              qualitative and quantitative information, 3) develop a                         
              mathematical/numerical model of the solidification process in                  
              the presence of double-diffusive convection and 4) compare the                 
              predictions of the model with the corresponding experimental                   
              data.                                                                          
                                                                                             
              An understanding of the role of interdendritic liquid flow in                  
              the porous media can aid in predicting segregation processes                   
              in freezing soils, and also in the control of the quality of                   
              castings.
