Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                     The detailed petrologic and geochemical study of a suite of            
              metrmorphic rocks recovered from the Hess Deep will be conducted.              
              The goal is to develop a model for the spatial and temporal                    
              evolution of metamorphism in the ocean crustal sections                        
              considering the effects of axial hydrothermal alteration, crustal              
              aging, and uplift and exposure of the scarps. This study provides              
              the opportunity to characterize the root.zones of hydrothermal                 
              systems as well as the processes that control the distribution of              
              metamorphism in oceanic crust.
