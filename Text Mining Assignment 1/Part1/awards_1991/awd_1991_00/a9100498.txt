Abstract    :
                   In this project the principal investigator will work with                 
              the postdoctoral associate Patricia Lewis on the asymptotic                    
              analysis of certain classes of two-dimensional integral equations              
              that contain a large parameter.  The main thrust of the research               
              will be to develop new methods for finding asymptotically correct              
              approximate solutions of the equations as the large parameter                  
              approaches infinity.  Such problems arise in investigations of                 
              the behavior of waves propagating in two dimensions in the limit               
              of large wavenumber.  This research will be especially valuable                
              because numerical solutions of the integral equations are not                  
              reliable as the parameter becomes large.                                       
                   Asymptotic methods work because the largeness or smallness                
              of a parameter in an equation can be used to simplify the                      
              equation to the point where an approximate solution, which is                  
              still meaningful, can be found more easily.  In this project the               
              principal investigator and a postdoctoral associate will use                   
              asymptotic methods to find accurate approximate solutions of                   
              integral equations that model the behavior of waves propagating                
              in the limit of large wavenumber.
