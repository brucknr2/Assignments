Abstract    :
              Mariculture operations must extend farther out to sea to                       
              achieve greater water circulation volumes to dilute fish                       
              farm washes.  In  realizing such developments, one faces                       
              substantial engineering challenges.  Prominent among these                     
              challenges are achieving the seaworthiness of the                              
              infrastructure, i.e., the containment system for the                           
              cultivars (pens, cages, and so forth), the improvement of                      
              construction materials in off-shore installations,                             
              primarily for the reduction of fouling; and the adaptation                     
              of containment or retention methods to the biological                          
              exigencies of the cultivars.                                                   
                                                                                             
              This engineering workshop focuses on the research needs to                     
              solve these problems and will invite internationally-known                     
              engineers and marine scientists from the following                             
              countries:  Japan, France, Canada, and Norway.  These                          
              countries have extensive federal and private sector off-                       
              shore mariculture research and development programs.                           
              Exchange of information on engineering approaches to off-                      
              shore mariculture promises a clearer definition of where                       
              engineering problems lie and how research activities                           
              should be formulated and organized to overcome these                           
              problems.
