Abstract    :
              Organometallic vapor phase epitaxy will be used to generate                    
              germanium films on a silicon substrate leading to                              
              silicon-germanium alloy and heterostructure formation.  The                    
              films will be produced as ultra-thin (1-10 atomic layer)                       
              structures as a means to engineering the electronic properties                 
              of the desired interfaces.  Interactions of the films with the                 
              silicon substrate will be investigated using SIMS, UPS and XPS                 
              surface science techniques.  These studies are aimed at a                      
              mechanistic understanding of the surface processes involved in                 
              the deposition of epitaxial germanium films.

              The research, in the general area of Analytical and Surface                    
              Chemistry, focuses on the formation of ultra-thin germanium                    
              films on silicon, leading to silicon-germanium alloys.  The                    
              results of the research promise to improve our general                         
              understanding of these alloys which have considerable potential                
              in integrated optoelectonic devices, transistors and thin film                 
              capacitors.
