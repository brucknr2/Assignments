Abstract    :
              The Chesapeake Bay Institute of Johns Hopkins University will                  
              provide shipboard technical services associated with the                       
              research vessel RIDGLEY WARFIELD, a 110-foot ship that is                      
              owned by the NSF and operated by the University.  A                            
              significant portion of the ship's operating schedule in                        
              recent years has been and is normally in support of NSF-                       
              sponsored research programs.  The Shipboard Technician                         
              Program has two components: an at-sea component and an ashore                  
              component.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              The at-sea component consists of instructing scientific                        
              personnel in the use of shared shipboard equipment;                            
              maintenance, repair, and calibration of scientific                             
              instrumentation; instruction and supervision of deck                           
              operations; and providing logistics assistance to on-coming                    
              and off-going scientific parties.  On shore activities                         
              include the maintenance, repair, and calibration of shared                     
              use seagoing equipment and assisting scientific personnel in                   
              preparing for field work on the vessel.  Shipboard                             
              technicians funded by this award have broad responsibilities                   
              for providing the coordination and assistance needed for the                   
              successful completion of research projects at sea.  The level                  
              of activity and amount of support are closely related to the                   
              size and capability of the vessel, and its scientific outfit                   
              and capability.
