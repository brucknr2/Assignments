Abstract    :
              The Mechanical Engineering Department of the University of                     
              Minnesota, Institute of Technology has a program of summer research            
              in mechanical engineering for science and engineering                          
              undergraduates.  Fifteen students (seven from ME, eight from other             
              schools) participate in the program.  Applicants for the program               
              are asked to submit transcripts, letters of recommendation, and an             
              essay.  Participants are selected by a panel of faculty members.               
              The program starts with an orientation in which research projects              
              and facilities are described.  Participants are asked to select a              
              project on which to work from a group of twenty ongoing research               
              programs in Mechanical Engineering.  A faculty supervisor monitors             
              the progress of each student.  Students are given increasing                   
              responsibilities as their skills develop.  Students are asked to               
              attend biweekly seminars which explore current research areas in               
              Mechanical Engineering.  The students live on campus in dormitories            
              close to one another so that they may share their research                     
              experiences.  An informal social program is organized.  At the end             
              of the summer, students are asked to prepare oral and written                  
              reports on their research activities.  An attempt is made to find              
              on-campus research jobs for students who do well in the program.
