Abstract    :
                   This grant supports work to measure the fluorescence cross                
              sections for producing the NI 120nm emission from                              
              photodissociative excitation of N2 from their respective                       
              thresholds to 200A.  Such cross sections are required for                      
              accurate quantitative analysis and for assessments of models of                
              the Earth's nitrogen dayglow.  The proposed work on the NI 120nm               
              measurements will be carried out with existing instrumentation                 
              which has been developed by the present group for use with light               
              sources at USC and the synchrotron radiation source at the                     
              University of Wisconsin Synchrotron Radiation Facilities.  A                   
              small Seya-Namioka type monochromator with a spectral bandwidth                
              of 10A is required for the NII measurements.  It is hoped that it              
              will also be possible to measure the cross section functions for               
              producing (1) the NI 113.4, 142.1, 149.3, and 174.3nm emissions                
              from N2 and (2) the OI 130.4 and OI 135.6nm, and OII 102.5nm from              
              O2.
