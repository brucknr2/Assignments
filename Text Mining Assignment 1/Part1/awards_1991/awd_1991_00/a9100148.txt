Abstract    :
                   This project is concerned with the structure of division                  
              rings, central simple algebras, and the ways in which they combine             
              to form Brauer groups.  Using finite groups, it is possible to                 
              describe division rings as crossed products.  An ultimate goal is              
              to relate the structure of the group with the arithmetic properties            
              of the center of the ring.                                                     
                   The research supported is in the general area of ring                     
              theory.  A ring is an algebraic object having an addition and a                
              multiplication defined on it.  Rings occur naturally in many areas             
              of mathematics.  This principal investigator will study how one                
              ring can contain another.  The work draws on some deep results in              
              group theory and will shed light on various questions in algebra               
              and number theory.
