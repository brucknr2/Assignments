Abstract    :
              Professor Chris L. Craney and other members of the Chemistry                   
              Department at Occidental College are being supported to                        
              continue a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site                  
              in Chemistry.  For the period 1991-93, eight undergraduate                     
              students will spend ten weeks each summer actively engaged in a                
              variety of research projects.  Projects include investigation                  
              of infrared spectra of metal-binding proteins, mechanism of                    
              electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions, and                             
              photochemical behavior of furocoumarin.  Students will give an                 
              oral interim report on their research and prepare a final                      
              poster presentation.  Students will be predominantly from                      
              two-year colleges.
