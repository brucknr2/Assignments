Abstract    :
              Experiments are proposed to study the properties of two-dimensional            
              arrays of electrons on a helium surface with the purpose of better             
              understanding the physics of particles confined to two-dimensions,             
              to test new theories, and to use the special properties of the                 
              electron array as a model system to study analogs of three-                    
              dimensional systems.  These include weakly-pinned charge-density               
              waves and polarons.  Particular emphasis will be placed on                     
              experiments designed to probe the quantum regime.  The nature of               
              quantum melting is of prime interest, and the phase diagram of                 
              electrons and its dependence on magnetic field will be studied.                
              Electrons on helium films have a distinct advantage as a model                 
              system to study polarons and the conduction properties of weakly-              
              pinned charge-density waves because the appropriate coupling                   
              parameter can be varied from the weak to strong limits by varying              
              the film thickness, and the range from classical to the quantum                
              limit can be spanned.
