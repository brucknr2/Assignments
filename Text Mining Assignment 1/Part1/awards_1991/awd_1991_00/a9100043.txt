Abstract    :
                   This project will study optimal control and symmetry                      
              principles of nonlinear systems.  In optimal control the                       
              principal investigator will attempt to develop a formal procedure              
              to calculate the cut-loci between surfaces consisting of                       
              endpoints of trajectories with different switching structures.                 
              These cut-loci are the dominant geometric feature for local                    
              optimality of trajectories near a reference point.  In symmetry                
              principles the principal investigator will try to extend to                    
              singular systems recent results on the calculation of feedback                 
              functions.                                                                     
                   These studies will lead to further understanding of the                   
              optimal design of mechanical systems where symmetries (e.g.                    
              rotational) are present.
