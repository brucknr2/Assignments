Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A team of six students will be supported by this Research                      
              Experiences for Undergraduates award.  They will work under the                
              supervision of the principal investigator, assisted by several                 
              faculty members of the mathematics department.  The program will               
                                                                                             
              run for eight weeks concentrating on problems of cooperative game              
                                                                                             
              theory.  A well-trained mathematics student can understand the                 
              basic concepts with only a short period of preparation.  Some                  
              preliminary reading will be assigned before the students arrive                
              at the site.                                                                   
                                                                                             
              Several areas in which there is ample potential for the                        
              development of sound research projects will be presented to the                
              students. They include value axiomatics, application of values to              
                                                                                             
              real life cost allocations, value computation of the nucleolus of              
                                                                                             
              a game and multi-alternative voting power indices and matroidal                
              simple games. Ample computational support for the project will be              
                                                                                             
              provided by the college.                                                       
                                                                                             
              Efforts will made to have students attend part of the annual                   
              international conference on game theory held at Ohio State                     
              University during the summer.  Visits to the NSF center, the                   
              Advanced Research Institute for Discrete and Applied Mathematics               
                                                                                             
              at nearby Rutgers University are also expected.  Final reports                 
              are expected at the end of the program.  The most promising will               
                                                                                             
              be revised where necessary for journal submission.
