Abstract    :
              Dr. Michael E. Silver of the Chemistry Department, Hope                        
              College, is being supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and                
              Organometallic Program for work on the synthesis and                           
              characterization of early transition metal allyl compounds.                    
              Specifically, compounds containing the moiety Cp(allyl)M, where                
              M=Zr or Hf, will be synthesized.  The allyl ligand will be                     
              methylated to improve stability of the product.  The compounds                 
              prepared will then be used to synthesize early-late transition                 
              metal bimetallic compounds.  In one attempt, the Grignard                      
              reagent prepared from the allyl species will be reacted with                   
              late transition metal carbonylates.  In another, late metal                    
              hydrides will be used.  The allyl species will also be used to                 
              study fluxionality of the allyl group.                                         
              %%%                                                                            
              The goal of the research is to enhance the catalytic reactivity                
              of the early transition metal center by associating it with a                  
              late-transition metal.  Although this strategy has not                         
              successed previously, positive results would have implications                 
              for the development of useful industrial catalysts.  It is                     
              anticipated that the project will result in the synthesis of                   
              novel organometallic species and the work will be of                           
              considerable educational value to the undergraduate students                   
              who will participate in the program.
