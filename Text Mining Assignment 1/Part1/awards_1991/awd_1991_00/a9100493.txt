Abstract    :
              Professor Michael A. Walters and other members of the Chemistry                
              Department at Dartmouth College are being supported to continue                
              a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in                        
              Chemistry.  For the period 1991-93, eight undergraduate                        
              students will spend eleven weeks each summer actively engaged                  
              in a variety of research projects.  Some of the projects                       
              involve mechanisms of organic reactions, determination of lead                 
              concentration in the environment, and model complexes for                      
              nickel enzymes.  Students will write a journal-style report and                
              give an oral presentation on their results.
