Abstract    :
              Professor Bing M. Fung and other members of the Chemistry                      
              Department at the University of Oklahoma are being supported to                
              continue a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site                  
              in Chemistry.  For the period 1991-93, eight undergraduate                     
              students will spend ten weeks each summer actively engaged in a                
              variety of research projects.  Some of the projects will                       
              involve characterization of proteins, enzymes, and DNA,                        
              development of liquid crystal devices, and characterization of                 
              marine natural products.  In addition to work in their own                     
              research groups, students will attend seminars on ongoing                      
              research in the department and research in local industries,                   
              take field trips to local industrial laboratories, and receive                 
              instruction in library use.  In addition to presenting a                       
              seminar on the results of their own research, the students will                
              prepare a poster presentation.
