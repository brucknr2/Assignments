Abstract    :
                   Eight different meteorological organizations ranging from a               
              university to a National Weather Service Office will host up to                
              fifteen undergraduate students during the summer months in a                   
              Research Experiences for Undergraduates site visit format.  The                
              students will attend lectures, be exposed to a wide variety of                 
              research, academic and operational activities in the fields of                 
              meteorology, electrical engineering and computer science.                      
              Additionally, each student will be assigned to and work with a                 
              senior professional on a topic matched as closely as possible                  
              with the students interest.
