Abstract    :
                   This action will provide for equipment for about five                     
              fully instrumented mirrors of the High Resolution Fly's Eye                    
              design.  These would be used with five others to be built                      
              later and deployed on Little Granite, in Dugway, Utah, the                     
              developed site of the existing Fly's Eye Detector.  Together                   
              with the Chicago Air Shower Array and the Michigan Array, both                 
              also at Dugway, these ten mirrors would be used to understand                  
              the cosmic ray shower development with unprecedented precision                 
              and measure spectrum at 10^17 electron volts.                                  
                   The instrument of ten mirrors would be a unique                           
              scientific instrument capable of making significant cosmic ray                 
              measurements.
