Abstract    :
              Professor Michael D. Seymour and other members of the Chemistry                
              Department of Hope College are being supported to continue a                   
              Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in                          
              Chemistry.  For the period 1991-93, eight undergraduate                        
              students will spend ten weeks each summer actively engaged in a                
              variety of research projects.  Some of the projects involve                    
              investigating the role of ferritin in biological iron storage,                 
              synthesis of tin and lead alkoxides as precursors to                           
              electroconducting thin films, and developing flow injection                    
              "amplification" for trace analysis.  Communication skills will                 
              be emphasized by student presentations at the beginning and end                
              of the program, and by preparation of a written report after                   
              the project has been completed.
