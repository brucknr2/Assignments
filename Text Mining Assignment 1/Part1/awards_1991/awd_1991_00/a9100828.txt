Abstract    :
                   An eight.week Research Experiences for Undergraduates                     
              program will be supported by this grant.  Ten students will work               
              individually or in small groups on projects in several areas                   
              ofmathematics.  The advisory staff includes two principal                      
              investigators, three faculty associates and a graduate assistant.              
              Participants will choose or design their own projects, prepare                 
              written reports on their activities and participate in                         
              mini.courses, which will be videotaped for distribution.  Ample                
              computing facilities ranging from a MacIntosh laboratory to a                  
              Sequent parallel machine will be available.                                    
                   Research topics will be chosen from a variety of areas of                 
              faculty expertise.  They include ergodic theory, graph theory                  
              and combinatorics, probability, number theory and commutative                  
              algebra.  The department is also nationally recognized for its                 
              research concentration on the mathematics of tomography.                       
                   This award represents the principal investigator's fifth REU              
              site award.  Many of the 40 former participants are now pursuing               
              graduate work in science.
