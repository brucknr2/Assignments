Abstract    :
                   This work is designed to develop and demonstrate a non-                   
              contacting sensor with sub-micron precision and resolution.  It                
              will be capable of measuring three linear and three rotational                 
              parameters, giving it six degrees of freedom capability, while                 
              being located entirely on one side of the target.  This device will            
              consist of several lateral effect photodiodes and several light                
              sources which will all be incorporated into a unique arrangement               
              in a single package.                                                           
                   No such device exists today.  This device, if successful, will            
              be a significant advancement in sensor technology and should be                
              very cost effective.  It will have potential applications in a                 
              whole spectrum of manufacturing situations with a major impact on              
              Metrology and Inspection.
