Abstract    :
                   The focus and central theme of the 1991 Symposium on the                  
              Interface of Computing Science and Statistics will be on a variety             
              of critical applications of scientific (including statistical)                 
              computing and the research challenges that they present.  Sessions             
              are planned on computational genetics, medical imaging, and                    
              labelled point data, which arise in evolutionary biology as well as            
              imaging.  Another application area will be engineering, including              
              speech recognition, satellite imaging, and software engineering.               
              The meeting will be held in conjunction with a Workshop on                     
              Computational Molecular Biology.                                               
                   The Symposium and Workshop are being held in Seattle,                     
              Washington on April 21-24, 1991.  The Symposium is organized to                
              capitalize on the natural synergy that the Workshop offers as well             
              as on the technical strengths in computing and engineering at                  
              Boeing and in biostatistics, computer science, engineering, and                
              medicine at the University of Washington.  A series of technical               
              tutorials on computer science topics will be offered to encourage              
              statisticians and other applications-oriented participants to learn            
              about key ideas and new technologies that are needed for interface             
              work.
