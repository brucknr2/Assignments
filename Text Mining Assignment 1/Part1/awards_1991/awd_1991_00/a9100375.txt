Abstract    :
              This award provides support to the Department of Sociology at the              
              University of Nebraska-Lincoln to continue their Research                      
              Experiences for Undergraduates SITE.  The program is designed to               
              give undergraduate sociology and social science majors attending               
              academic institutions in the Northern Great Plains region a ten-               
              week research experience in sociology.  The primary objective of               
              this program is to provide a high-quality research environment                 
              for students who have limited access to research facilities and                
              training at the schools they are attending and for students who                
              are under-represented in science careers (women, minorities, and               
              the disabled).  Using the research facilities of the Bureau of                 
              Sociological Research and under the close guidance of faculty                  
              supervisors, students will initiate and carry out research                     
              projects from formulating a problem to writing a final report.                 
              Students will participate in morning seminars where they will                  
              learn research methods and share their ongoing research with each              
              other.  Afternoons will be spent engaging in individual projects               
              and learning to use appropriate research technologies.  The                    
              students' papers will be presented at the Nebraska Undergraduate               
              Sociology Symposium held each fall and submitted for presentation              
              at the Midwest Sociological Society meeting.
