Abstract    :
                   This award will provide support for two undergraduates working            
              under faculty supervision of mathematical problems arising in the              
              theory of control, design and simulation of linear dynamical                   
              systems.  The mathematics of differential equations and matrix                 
              theory will be central to these investigations.                                
                   Problems will be selected from studies on the stabilization of            
              linear dynamical systems by output feedback, control design and                
              simulation for Euler-Bernoulli beam with Kelvin-Voigt Damping,                 
              computation of Bezout fractions, computation of the gap metric and             
              polynomial control for discrete linear control systems.                        
                   The two students are University Scholars at the Penn State,               
              University Park, campus who will be working at the Wilkes-Barre                
              campus (where they completed their first two years' studies).
