Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project supports the dissertation research of a cultural                  
              anthropologist from Cornell University in Nepal.  Using                        
              ethnographic methodology, the student will study a diverse group               
              of Tibetan refugees to see how they maintain and construct their               
              Tibetan ethnic identity in the face of alternate ethnic                        
              identities and foreign influences.  The project will focus on the              
              production of Tibetan religious artifacts and their sale to                    
              foreigners.  Using in depth interviews, the student will study                 
              how the Tibetan emigrant population defends its sense of itself                
              as a separate ethnic group.                                                    
                                                                                             
              This research is important because the rate of inter-cultural                  
              mixing, borrowing and merging in the contemporary world is                     
              unprecedented at the same time that the strength of particular                 
              ethnic identities (and inter-ethnic hostilities) seems to be                   
              growing.  This is a global phenomenon, and the micro-processes by              
              which groups maintain and re-create their ethnic identities to                 
              fit novel social situations is relatively little studied.                      
              Understanding the issues involved in this one case will help                   
              develop general theory.
