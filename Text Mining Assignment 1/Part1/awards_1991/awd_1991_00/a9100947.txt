Abstract    :
                   Minority students from three HBCU;s (Historically Black                   
              Colleges and Universities) and a major university (The University              
              of South Carolina) will work with three geology professors for                 
              two summers; additionally, students from the local HBCU (Benedict              
              College) will have the opportunity to continue working on their                
              projects during the academic year.                                             
                   The program proposes to accomplish two main objectives:                   
              (1) to provide research experiences in the geosciences for                     
              regional minority students, and (2) to expose them to                          
              alternatives to strictly theoretical approaches to science; many               
              minority students never get this opportunity.  The participants                
              will gain experience in geologic field work; sample                            
              collection/preservation; data gathering and analysis; and oral                 
              and written presentation of scientific results.  Inherent to                   
              these research experiences will be exposure to geologic                        
              information (both formally and informally), and the opportunity                
              to work with accomplished researchers.                                         
                   The projects include environmentally relevant areas of                    
              research, namely: (1) the physico-chemical properties of                       
              saprolites of the South Carolina Piedmont, and biogeochemistry of              
              salt marshes of South Carolina.
