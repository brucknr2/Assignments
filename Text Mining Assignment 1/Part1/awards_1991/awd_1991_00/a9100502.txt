Abstract    :
              A diverse group of scientists, ranging from geneticists,                       
              molecular biologists, biophysicists, and structural and                        
              theoretical chemists, will gather to discuss new approaches to                 
              elucidating and engineering functional properties in proteins.                 
              The primary focus of the workshop will be on the study of                      
              molecular recognition events as probed by mutational analysis and              
              biophysical methods. The systems of interest will include                      
              enzyme-substrate, antibody-antigen and protein-protein                         
              interactions.  Also included will be new biophysical, structural,              
              theoretical and molecular biology developments that apply to the               
              problems of molecular recognition in proteins.
