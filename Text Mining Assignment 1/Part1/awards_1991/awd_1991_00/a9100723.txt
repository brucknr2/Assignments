Abstract    :
                   Univariate splines and their tensor products will be used to              
              construct approximations to infinite-dimensional main effect and               
              interaction components  for models of unknown (exponential                     
              family) distributions or conditional distributions.  Theoretical               
              properties will be explored in mathematically rigorous fashion                 
              and real examples will be pursued for data assumed to come from                
              independent trials and for data from bivariate time series.  The               
              overall goal is to improve the efficacy and accessibility of the               
              statistical framework underlying the analysis of data and the                  
              design of experiments.
