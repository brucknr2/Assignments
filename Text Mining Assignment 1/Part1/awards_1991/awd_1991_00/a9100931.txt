Abstract    :
              This award provides support to The Savannah River Ecology                      
              Laboratory (SREL) to continue their Research Experiences for                   
              Undergraduates SITE for another two years.  The program will                   
              provide research experience, training and career perspective for               
              undergraduate students through the use of SREL's unique field                  
              sites, laboratory facilities, and the association and active                   
              involvement in research with full-time research ecologists.                    
              Project participants will examine the influence of by-products of              
              nuclear and fossil fuel energy production on selected biological               
              and chemical properties in southeastern ecosystems.  SREL faculty              
              members, all actively engaged in research and publication, will                
              be paired with students having compatible research interests.                  
              Student projects, while distinct and independent, are portions of              
              ongoing research programs of SREL.  The student experience is                  
              enhanced by interaction with a programmatic team comprising                    
              individuals with a diversity of ecological backgrounds,                        
              interests, and ideas.  Applicants from minority schools and                    
              regional institutions with limited research programs will                      
              continue to be actively encouraged, as in previous years.                      
              Participant selection is based upon the quality of an                          
              application, letters of recommendation and academic record.                    
              Through the research training of more than 420 undergraduate                   
              participants over the past 23 years, SREL has created a highly                 
              successful program of student/advisor interaction.  Scientific                 
              publications and career development of former participants attest              
              to the success of the program.
