Abstract    :
                   This project will bring 6 undergraduate students to the                   
              Ohio Supercomputer Center for 10 weeks during the Summer of                    
              1991 to work on problems in computational fluid dynamics,                      
              flow visualization, grid generation, and numerical solution                    
              of PDEs.  Half of the positions are committed to minorities                    
              selected form colleges and universities located in the                         
              northeastern United States.  The students will receive three                   
              weeks of instruction in the use of supercomputers followed by                  
              7 weeks of in-depth research on an appropriate project.
