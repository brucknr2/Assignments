Abstract    :
              It is proposed to write a history of "Fracture Mechanics", one of              
              the breakthrough achievements of mechanics research in past half               
              century.  The history will be divided into three periods.  The                 
              first period will cover developments from Leonardo da Vinci (1452-             
              -1519) up to the conclusion of World War II.  The second period                
              will deal with the emergence and acceptance of fracture mechanics -            
              -- 1947 through 1965.  The third and final period will deal with               
              modern developments from the mid sixties to the present time.
