Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project involves a graduate student in cultural anthropology              
              who will study the activities of people in Papua New Guinea who                
              have left regional high schools before graduation to return to                 
              their villages.  These "secondary school leavers" have                         
              participated in both traditional and Western forms of education,               
              and the project will investigate the impact of this "Western"                  
              experience on the traditional forms of education.  Methods                     
              include participant observation, in-depth interviews with                      
              teachers and students, a household survey of a local community,                
              and participant observation and focused interviews at four                     
              regional high schools.                                                         
                                                                                             
              This research is important because people from diverse cultures                
              are engaged with "Western" style schooling all over the world,                 
              with varying degrees of success.  Knowledge about how forms of                 
              classroom education differ and are similar to traditional forms                
              of indigenous education will help educational planners devise                  
              programs to increase the chances for success of multi-cultural                 
              educational programs in other settings and nations.
