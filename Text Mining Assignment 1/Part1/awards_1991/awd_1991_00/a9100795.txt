Abstract    :
                   This research is focussed on an aircraft experiment to be                 
              carried out as part of the FIRE phase II intensive field                       
              observational program that is planned for the November/December                
              1991 time frame in Kansas.  The primary platform for the proposed              
              research is the NCAR Sabreliner aircraft equipped with radiation,              
              microphysics, air motion and flight level meteorological sensors.              
              New radiation instruments will be installed on the Sabreliner                  
              both to obtain spectrally detailed information about solar                     
              radiation and more accurate broadband flux measurements.                       
                   The ultimate goal of this research is to incorporate new                  
              observational results into numerical models of cirrus cloud that               
              vary in scale of interest and complexity with the ultimate                     
              purpose of testing parameterizations of cirrus for use in large                
              scale climate models.  This research is important because it                   
              addresses questions relevant to issues of global climate change.
