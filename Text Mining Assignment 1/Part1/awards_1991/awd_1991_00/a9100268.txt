Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This application is for partial funding of the 1991 Summer                     
              Conference on Smooth Muscle to be held under the auspices of the               
              Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB)              
              from July 14 to July 19, 1991, at Copper Mountain, Colorado.  About            
              150 scientists will be selected from applications on the basis of              
              expertise, interest, contribution, and balance to provide an                   
              intellectually stimulating environment.  This meeting will focus               
              specifically on areas of notable advancement and new conceptual                
              development in smooth muscle, including membrane ion channels, Ca2+            
              pumps, regulation of intracellular calcium, cGMP second messenger              
              system, regulation and functions of contractile proteins, and                  
              molecular adaptations of contractile protein expression. We will               
              provide a special effort to integrate dell and molecular research              
              with that at the organismic level in these sessions.  These                    
              combinations are distinct from the first three Smooth Muscle                   
              conferences, and from any smooth muscle conference that has                    
              occurred to date.  The meeting will be particularly useful for                 
              interactions of scientists working in rapidly developing areas, and            
              will be specifically designed to provide improved dialogue among               
              those working in highly specialized areas.  Suggestions of new                 
              experiments and refinement of concepts that are likely to occur                
              will importantly advance current knowledge in many areas of smooth             
              muscle research.//
