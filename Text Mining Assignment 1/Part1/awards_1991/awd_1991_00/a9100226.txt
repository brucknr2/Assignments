Abstract    :
                                                                                              
               The development of highly parallel computational methods for                 
              the solution of three-dimensional transient partial differential               
              equations representing fluid flow in porous media and the                      
              transport of reactive solutes is proposed.  These methods will                 
              focus on large scale three dimensional problems and will have                  
              applications in enhanced oil recovery and restoration of                       
              contaminated groundwater systems.  The methods will be                         
              implemented, and performance and scaling issues assessed, using                
              the Connection Machine as the target architecture.
