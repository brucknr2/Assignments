Abstract    :
              This research, supported by the Analytical and Surface                         
              Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division, will study                        
              mechanisms of electrochemically-initiated organic chemical                     
              reactions.  A novel portion of the work will seek to adjust the                
              nature of reaction products by exciting reagents near the                      
              electrodes with ultraviolet light.  In addition, some                          
              measurements of atomic-scale structure will be made using                      
              Scanning Tunneling Microscopy.                                                 
                                                                                             
              %%%                                                                            
                                                                                             
              This research, supported by the Analytical and Surface                         
              Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division, will study several                
              topics in organic electrochemistry.  Series of compounds will                  
              be investigated so that the transition from SN1 to SN2                         
              mechanisms as structure varies can be predicted.  In turn, this                
              will allow prediction of stereoselectivity in                                  
              electrochemically-generated organic species.  Photochemical                    
              excitation prior to electrochemistry will be investigated as a                 
              means of varying product makeup.  Finally, adsorption on                       
              electrodes will be studied with Scanning Tunneling Microscopy,                 
              as a means to independently characterize adsorption on                         
              electrode surfaces.
