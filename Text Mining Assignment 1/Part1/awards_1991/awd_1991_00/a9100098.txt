              environmental engineers, a significant component of which                      
              involves conduct of research by university faculty with                        
              the assistance of students primarily at the graduate                           
              level.  Topics planned include consideration of                                
              undergraduate environmental engineering education,                             
              inclusion of hazardous waste topics and innovative                             
              technologies to deal with them in courses, concerns                            
              relating to the role of research in graduate education and
