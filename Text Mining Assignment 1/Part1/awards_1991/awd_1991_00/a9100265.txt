Abstract    :
                   This project will bring 12 undergraduate students to the                  
              intelligent Systems Lab of American University for 8 weeks                     
              during the Summer of 1991 to do research into the design and                   
              use of expert systems and neural networks.  The focus will be                  
              on a synergism of expert systems and neural networks                           
              techniques as applied to real world problems, particularly                     
              in the biomedical area.  During the first 2 weeks students                     
              will receive training in the use of expert systems and neural                  
              network tools, followed by 6 weeks of intensive research.                      
              Six faculty members from the Computer Science and Information                  
              Systems department will direct the student research and                        
              generally act as mentors.
