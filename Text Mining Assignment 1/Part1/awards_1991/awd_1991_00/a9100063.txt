Abstract    :
              A comprehensive theoretical investigation of the electronic                    
              properties and growth of thin film diamond is proposed.  It will               
              employ electronic structure and ab-initio molecular dynamics                   
              methods to study a) novel growth processes for diamond thin films              
              and b) doping of diamond.  The main focus of the growth part will              
              be on mechanism leading to Atomic Layer Epitaxy for diamond and the            
              rate=limiting steps in low pressure CVD growth.  The impurities and            
              defect part will concentrate on n type doping and on the                       
              possibility of altering the thermodynamic balance between diamond              
              and graphite by an addition of a substantial amount of impurities.
