Abstract    :
                   This proposal relates the design of an experiment, i.e., its              
              particular choices of experimental conditions, and the implications            
              for the statistical analysis of the resulting data.  "Optimal"                 
              designs will be constructed for discrete settings, and research                
              will be continued on asymmetrical orthogonal arrays.  In addition,             
              the relationships between the design and dimension reduction                   
              procedures used in the analysis will be explored; and a theory will            
              be developed for determining for which designs these analytic                  
              techniques work, and perhaps leading to the development of new                 
              designs with optimality properties for such analyses.
