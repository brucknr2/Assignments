Abstract    :
              This award is to help support a doctoral dissertation.  The                    
              dissertation will utilize the 1850-1880 federal census of                      
              population and agriculture to produced a pooled cross-section of               
              panel-like data for six rural townships in Missouri.  The purpose              
              of the study is analyze the relationship between changes in family             
              and household demography and changes in economic performance in the            
              sample townships.  The major question to be addressed is how did               
              fertility, persistence, race, and birthplace affect tenancy rates,             
              farm income and market orientation during this crucial period in               
              American development?  Statistical tests will be undertaken to                 
              determine the degree of correlation between family characteristics             
              and the path and progress of agricultural development.  It will                
              then be determined how a family's characteristics aided or hindered            
              the production of an agricultural surplus for sale in the market.              
              This project is important because it will provide a better                     
              understanding of the economic process during a crucial period in               
              American history.
