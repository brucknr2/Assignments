Abstract    :
              Professor Marlin D. Harmony and other members of the Chemistry                 
              Department of the University of Kansas are being supported to                  
              continue a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site                  
              in Chemistry.  For the priod 1991-93, eight undergraduate                      
              students will spend ten weeks each summer actively engaged in a                
              variety of research projects.  Example projects involve                        
              investigation of proteins using laser spectroscopy, organic                    
              synthesis, and stereochemically controlled polymerization                      
              catalysis.  Activities include weekly seminars and the                         
              presentation of interim and final reports, orally, in a poster                 
              session, and in writing.
