Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              "Surface Modification of Stainless Steels to Enhance Passivation"              
                                                                                             
              This investigator examines the application of a square wave voltage            
              (AV) to stainless steels that are immersed in an electrolyte.  The             
              idea is to significantly increase the stability of the passive film            
              on the stainless steel by the AV processing.  Experiments are being            
              conducted to show the general applicability of the process to other            
              stainless steels, examine the pertinent experimental variables,                
              explore subsequent treatments to enhance the passivity, and study              
              the surface chemistry to gain knowledge on the mechanisms creating             
              the enhanced passivity.                                                        
              %%%                                                                            
              The approach is unique, a totally new process for stainless steels,            
              representing a significant modification to existing practice.  If              
              successful, the approach could eventually lead to new, simple                  
              procedure for improving the corrosion resistance of stainless                  
              steels through surface modification.
