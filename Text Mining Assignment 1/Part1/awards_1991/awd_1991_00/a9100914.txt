Abstract    :
              Professor Lawrence F. Duffy and other members of the Chemistry                 
              Department at the University of Alaska at Fairbanks are being                  
              supported to continue a Research Experiences for Undergraduates                
              (REU) site in Chemistry and Biochemistry.  For the period                      
              1991-93, eight undergraduate students will spend ten weeks each                
              summer actively engaged in a variety of research projects.                     
              Projects range from physical chemistry to biological chemistry,                
              and include projects in Raman spectroscopy, atmospheric,                       
              environmental and analytical chemistry, chemical ecology,                      
              petroleum and geochemistry, bio-organic chemistry and marine                   
              chemistry, as well as chemical anthropology and molecular                      
              evolution.  Many projects are related to local Alaskan                         
              interests.  The program includes a seminar series and a poster                 
              symposium at the end of the summer.
