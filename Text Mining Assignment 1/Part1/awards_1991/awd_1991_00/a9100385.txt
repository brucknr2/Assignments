Abstract    :
              This proposal seeks to evaluate the kinetics of cell                           
              growth, and the synthesis of macromolecules in single                          
              eukaryotic cells with theoretical and experimental tools                       
              that have been developed during a previous award.  These                       
              tools will continue to be developed, and will permit the                       
              mapping of the dynamic patterns of eukaryotic cell                             
              populations under a variety of environmental conditions at                     
              the single cell level.  The engineering benefit of this                        
              study will be kinetic models that have a much better                           
              predictive value than conventional non-segregated models.
