Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a grant to support travel of 12 graduate students to                   
              the 1991 Gordon Research Conference on the Chemistry of                        
              Supramolecules and Assemblies, to be held March 4-9, 1991, in                  
              Oxnard, California.  The conference focuses on the chemistry                   
              and physics of organized media, such as normal and reverse                     
              micelles, bilayers, monolayers, polymeric surfactants, nucleic                 
              acids, proteins, and microemulsions.  Gordons Conferences                      
              provide an unusual opportunity for young scientists and                        
              engineers to obtain a valuable perspective on their fields and                 
              also to meet and talk with major researchers.
