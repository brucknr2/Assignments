Abstract    :
              In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program                 
              of the Chemistry Division, Bernheim will use polarized laser                   
              radiation in five studies. In one experiment, the effect of                    
              optical orientation of a reagent species on chemical                           
              equilibrium will be examined.  Light-induced drift will be                     
              studied in another experiment in order to sort and spatially                   
              trap species in the gas phase.  Other experiments will deal                    
              with molecular polarization pumping, relaxation of orientation                 
              and alignment, and infrared polarization-labeling spectroscsopy                
              of polyatomic molecules.                                                       
              %%%                                                                            
              Bernheim's experimental program uses polarized light to study                  
              the effect of optically induced orientation on various                         
              properties of a molecular system.  For example, the equilibrium                
              concentrations of species can be changed by exciting one of the                
              reagents with polarized light.  Studies such as those under                    
              investigation in this project, when coupled with theoretical                   
              analyses and comparisons, will go a long way towards                           
              understanding the dynamics of excited atoms and molecules.
