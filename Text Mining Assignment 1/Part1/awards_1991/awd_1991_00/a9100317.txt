Abstract    :
                   The classification and construction of manifolds and                      
              varieties is one of the basic themes in mathematics.  Surgery                  
              theory is a fundamental tool in this area.  It is a construction               
              which, in certain circumstances, allows one to modify a manifold               
              by 'cutting and pasting', thereby changing the manifold's                      
              homotopy type.  The technique has many important applications.                 
              The study of the obstructions to doing surgery on a manifold has               
              become a subject in its own right, giving rise to various                      
              theories which model surgery in an algebraic setting.                          
                   Poincare' spaces have the same algebraic topological                      
              properties as manifolds but are homotopy theoretic in nature.                  
              Since many of the applications of surgery theory on manifolds                  
              involve the use of Poincare' spaces, one would like to have a                  
              theory of Poincare' surgery.  This project is concerned with such              
              a surgery theory, building on the investigator's previous results              
              in the area, and with the construction of an algebraic model for               
              the theory.                                                                    
                   Manifolds are very natural objects to study, being simply                 
              spaces which are locally like Euclidean spaces.  The space in                  
              which we live is either a 3-dimensional or a 4-dimensional                     
              manifold, depending upon whether one includes or excludes the                  
              time dimension.  Improving and simplifying the technical tools                 
              for investigating properties of manifolds is thus a fundamental                
              and important endeavor.
