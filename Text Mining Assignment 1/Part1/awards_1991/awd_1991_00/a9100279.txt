Abstract    :
                   This awards supports the research of Professor G. Kempf to                
              work in algebraic geometry.  He will study the syzygies of                     
              homogeneous coordinate rings, matrices on Picard bundles of                    
              algebraic curves, and moduli of Abelian varieties.                             
                   The research is in the field of algebraic geometry, one of the            
              oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which blossomed to the             
              point where it has, in the past 10 years, solved problems that have            
              stood for centuries.  Originally, it treated figures defined in the            
              plane by the simplest of equations, namely polynomials.  Today, the            
              field uses methods not only from algebra, but also from analysis               
              and topology, and conversely it is extensively used in those                   
              fields.  Moreover it has proved itself useful in fields as diverse             
              as physics, theoretical computer science, cryptography, coding                 
              theory and robotics.
