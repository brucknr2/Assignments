Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a Research Experiences for Undergraduates Site grant.                  
              The award permits undergraduate students to participate in a                   
              research program in the materials field under the supervision of               
              faculty members actively engaged in research.  The Cornell                     
              program  emphasizes significant recruitment and participation of               
              minorities and females, as well as representation from                         
              universities nationwide.  The program lasts ten weeks in the                   
              summer, and includes instruction in the use of libraries, search               
              of electronic data bases, research in teams composed of                        
              undergraduates, graduate students, post-docs, and faculty                      
              members, planning of experiments, use of instrumentation for                   
              research on polymer-based fibers, data analysis, oral                          
              presentation of results in a university-wide seminar.  Research                
              undertaken includes fiber chemistry, biomedical textiles, high                 
              performance fibers, composite materials, liquid crystal polymers,              
              and dye chemistry.  Funding is provided for six students.  The                 
              program enhances current research activities as well as adding to              
              the number of scientifically trained individuals.  It is hoped                 
              that this hands-on experience will serve as a stimulus to                      
              attract and retain highly-gifted students into careers in                      
              teaching and research.
