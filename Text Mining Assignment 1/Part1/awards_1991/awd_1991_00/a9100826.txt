Abstract    :
                   This project will support 8 students for 10 weeks during                  
              the summer of 1991 to do research in computer science at the                   
              University of Alabama at Tuscaloosa.  The first two weeks                      
              will be comprised of classroom lecture and introduction to                     
              research methodologies.  The final 8 weeks will focus on                       
              research projects such as: (1) Textual Descriptions of                         
              Graphical System Models, (2) Think-Time Oriented CPU                           
              Scheduling, (3) System Modelling from User Requirements, (4)                   
              Generalized Traffic Control, (5) A Literate PDL, (6) Computer                  
              User Modelling, and (7) System Model Decomposition for Formal                  
              Specification.
