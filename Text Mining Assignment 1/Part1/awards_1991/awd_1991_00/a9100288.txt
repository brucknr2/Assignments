Abstract    :
              Professor Kerry K. Karukstis and other members of the Chemistry                
              Department of Harvey Mudd College are being supported to                       
              conduct a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in                
              Chemistry.  For the period 1991-93, eight or nine undergraduate                
              students will spend ten weeks each summer actively engaged in a                
              variety of research projects.  Some of the projects involve                    
              theoretical studies of molecular excited states, thermodynamics                
              of liquid crystals, and electrochemical studies of polymer thin                
              films.  Students will write a final report on their work and                   
              participate in research-related and social events planned by                   
              the faculty.
