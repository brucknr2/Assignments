Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This project uses time series analysis on a national sample               
              of employed adults to assess differing explanations for the                    
              increasing inequality of incomes.   Human capital and status                   
              attainment explanations focus on characteristics of individuals                
              such as their education.  This project compares those perspec-                 
              tives to effects produced by changes in the structure of jobs                  
              (e.g., movement towards a U.S. service economy, and movement of                
              manufacturing to other countries) and wages (e.g., rapid creation              
              of low-wage jobs).  PI anticipates finding important, perhaps                  
              primary, effects of these structural changes.  The project                     
              permits comparing predictions of all three perspectives.  Out-                 
              comes of the research will contribute to sociological and econo-               
              mic analysis of changes in income distribution.  Applications of               
              the information would include design of intervention programs                  
              either at the individual (e.g., training programs) or the struc-               
              tural (e.g., international trade laws) levels. //
