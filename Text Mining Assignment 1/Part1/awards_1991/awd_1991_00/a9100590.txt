Abstract    :
                   This award supports two undergraduates working under the                  
              direction of the principal investigator on problems in                         
              mathematical analysis and dynamical systems.  The work in                      
              analysis centers on geometric questions related to classes of                  
              continuous functions.  Specifically, the students will consider                
              compositions of continuous function and the structures one                     
              obtains by forming convex combinations of the compositions.  The               
              work expands earlier investigations with combinations of measure               
              preserving transformations which occurs in the study of Markov                 
              operators.                                                                     
                   Investigations into dynamical systems will focus on recently              
              developed ideas of pseudo-orbit shadowing.  Shadowing measures                 
              the degree to which an orbit can be traced by nearby orbits.  The              
              phenomenon is important because dynamical systems with the                     
              shadowing property can be modeled on a computer.                               
                   Students will be encouraged to present the results of their               
              work at professional meetings.
