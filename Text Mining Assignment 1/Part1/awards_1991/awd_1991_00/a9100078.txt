Abstract    :
              This award provides partial funding for a Workshop that                        
              investigates the technology and applications of the electronic                 
              packaging technique called MultiChip Modules (MCMs) that are                   
              particularly relevant and of interest to the university community.             
              MCMs represent the next generation in packaging.  Currently                    
              packaging is a (if not the) major factor limiting system                       
              performance, cost reduction, and new applications.  However, the               
              technology is capital-intensive, and heretofore has been beyond the            
              reach of most universities.  Progress has now opened an opportunity            
              window for university involvement, and this workshop is intended               
              to investigate how to exploit this opportunity.
