Abstract    :
              The Skidaway Institute of Oceanography will receive support                    
              for shipboard technician activities associated with the R/V                    
              BLUE FIN, a 72-foot research vessel that is owned and                          
              operated by the University System of Georgia.  A significant                   
              portion of the ship's operating schedule during 1991 is in                     
              support of NSF-sponsored research projects.  The Shipboard                     
              Technician Program has two components: an at-sea component                     
              and an ashore component.                                                       
                                                                                             
              The at-sea component consists of instructing scientific                        
              personnel in the use of shared shipboard equipment;                            
              maintenance, repair, and calibration of scientific                             
              instrumentation; instruction and supervision of deck                           
              operations; and providing logistics assistance to on-coming                    
              and off-going scientific parties.  On shore activities                         
              include the maintenance, repair, and calibration of shared                     
              use seagoing equipment and assisting scientific personnel in                   
              preparing for field work on the vessel.  Shipboard                             
              technicians funded by this award have broad responsibilities                   
              for providing the coordination and assistance needed for the                   
              successful completion of research projects at sea.  The level                  
              of activity and amount of support are closely related to the                   
              size and capability of the vessel, and its scientific outfit                   
              and capability.
