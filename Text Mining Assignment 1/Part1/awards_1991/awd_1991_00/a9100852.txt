Abstract    :
              The School of Oceanography at University of Washington will                    
              receive support for shipboard technician activities associ-                    
              ated with the two research vessels operated by the Univer-                     
              sity: the R/V THOMAS THOMPSON and R/V CLIFFORD BARNES.  A                      
              significant portion of the ships' operating schedule in                        
              recent years and looking ahead are in support of NSF-                          
              sponsored research projects.  The Shipboard Technician                         
              Program has two components: an at-sea component and an ashore                  
              component.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              The at-sea component consists of instructing scientific                        
              personnel in the use of shared shipboard equipment; mainten-                   
              ance, repair, and calibration of scientific instrumentation;                   
              instruction and supervision of deck operations; and providing                  
              logistics assistance to on-coming and off-going scientific                     
              parties.  On shore activities include the maintenance,                         
              repair, and calibration of shared use seagoing equipment and                   
              assisting scientific personnel in preparing for field work on                  
              the vessel.  Shipboard technicians funded by this award have                   
              broad responsibilities for providing the coordination and                      
              assistance needed for the successful completion of research                    
              projects at sea.  The level of activity and amount of support                  
              are closely related to the size and capability of the vessel,                  
              and its scientific outfit and capability.
