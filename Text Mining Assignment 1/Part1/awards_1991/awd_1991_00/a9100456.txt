Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will test some major assumptions of life history                  
              models for body size and norms of reaction in age and size at                  
              maturity.  The intraspecific scaling of reproductive effort will               
              be described and mortality and the relationship between larval                 
              growth and adult life history parameters in four species of                    
              carrion flies from two families (Calliphoridae and Sarcophagidae)              
              measured.  Comparisons of the shapes of reaction norms provides a              
              powerful tool for testing the assumptions of life history models.              
              The proposed work will significantly increase our knowledge of                 
              the factors influencing the evolution of insect body size and the              
              consequences of alternative criteria for fitness in the                        
              prediction of values for life history traits at evolutionary                   
              equilibria.  Body size is correlated with virtually all other                  
              aspects of animal life histories, therefore insight into the                   
              evolution of animal size should lead to an improved understanding              
              of the evolution of many other features of life histories.
