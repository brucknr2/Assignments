Abstract    :
              This project is designed to expose ten undergraduate students,                 
              chosen from several Central Florida Institutions, to one year of               
              research experience in the development and applications of lasers.             
              Seven internationally recognized faculty in the Center for Research            
              in Electro Optics and Lasers (CREOL) will act as Research                      
              Supervisors in this project.  CREOL is a world leading center of               
              excellence in optics, laser development and laser-related sciences.            
              This program will be enhanced by: (1) an introductory course in the            
              basic principals of optics and lasers, taught by three principal               
              investigators; (2) the offering of a course on laser systems; (3)              
              weekly research seminars organized specifically for the REU                    
              students; (4) weekly industrial visits and seminars, provided by               
              the numerous optics and laser companies in the Orlando area; (5)               
              attendance at the annual SPIE Orlando optics conference, including             
              attendance at one of the many short courses; and (6) continuous                
              monitoring of the students' progress by the principal                          
              investigators.  Most of the activity will take place in the summer             
              term, with the students continuing part-time in the fall and                   
              spring.  The primary emphasis of this program is on encouraging                
              more talented undergraduate students from the Central Florida                  
              region to pursue graduate studies in the field of optics and                   
              lasers.
