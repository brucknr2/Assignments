Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis                       
              (IIASA) in Laxenburg, Austria, is an international research                    
              institution supported by National Member Organizations in 15                   
              countries, including the United States, the Soviet Union,                      
              Eastern and Western European nations, Japan, and Canada.  The                  
              focus of its research is on complex, policy-relevant problems                  
              that transcend the interests of single countries.  These                       
              problems include several that have particular significance                     
              for the United States, including, problems associated with                     
              the global environment, with demographic change, and with the                  
              transition of Eastern European countries to market economies.                  
              In December, 1989 the President determined that IIASA                          
              continues to do useful scientific work and merits continued                    
              support by the United States.  As subsequently emphasized by                   
              the President's Science Advisor, that determination required                   
              that the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the US                         
              National Member Organization for IIASA, should work with the                   
              National Science Foundation and other interested Government                    
              agencies to identify appropriate research areas and funding                    
              arrangements for IIASA.  In response to the Science Advisor's                  
              expectations, the American Academy has established a new U.S.                  
              Committee for IIASA chaired by Dr. Robert White, President of                  
              the National Academy of Engineering.  The primary purposes of                  
              that committee are to: (1) increase U.S. scientific partici-                   
              pation in research at IIASA, and (2) to assure that IIASA's                    
              research directions and the quality of the research it                         
              conducts are consistent with the interests of U.S. science and                 
              the U.S. Government.  This award will support the activities                   
              of that committee.
