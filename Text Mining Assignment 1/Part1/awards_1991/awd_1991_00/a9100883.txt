Abstract    :
              In a cooperative effort between the National Solar Observatory at              
              Sacramento Peak and the University of Texas at El Paso, junior and             
              senior electrical engineering and computer engineering students                
              spend the summer working on design projects at UTEP and at the                 
              Observatory.  At present, Observatory personnel do not have the                
              time or resources to retrofit or redesign existing equipment that,             
              although marginal, functions at an acceptable level.  This opens               
              the door for many student design projects aimed at optimizing                  
              existing equipment.  These projects include the design of a serial             
              handbox interface for telescope control, the development of a noise            
              insensitive fiber optic link for CCD camera data, and the design               
              of calibrated timing source for synchronizing                                  
              instruments used for solar observations.
