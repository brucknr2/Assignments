              Description:  This project supports participation by a U.S.                    
              delegation to the "World Congress on Natural Hazard                            
              Reduction" planned for February 1-9, 1991 in New Delhi,                        
              India.  The congress is organized by Dr. K.N. Majumdar of                      
              the Institution of Engineers (India).  Among topics to be                      
              covered are: geological hazards, including earthquakes and                     
              land slides; atmospheric hazards, including hurricanes and                     
              severe storms, droughts, and floods; social science                            
              perspectives, including mitigation planning, social theory,                    
              trends, global change, policy and application, group                           
              behavior, policy and institutional analysis; and                               
              engineering and environmental management.                                      
                                                                                             
              Scope:  It is planned that eight U.S. scientists covering                      
              the different topics will participate.  They are expected                      
              to convey lessons learned and approaches to hazard                             
              reduction in the U.S., to make contacts with Indian                            
              researchers who are developing plans for the International                     
              Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction, and to visit Indian                     
              institutes involved in research in these areas.  This                          
              project is likely to increase the interaction and                              
              cooperation between scientists and engineers in the two                        
              countries.
