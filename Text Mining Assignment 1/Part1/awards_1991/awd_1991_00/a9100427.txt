              Experimental Biology to establish a Research Experiences for                   
              Undergraduates Site.  The program consists of an intensive "hands-             
              on" laboratory research experience performed under the guidance of             
              working scientists expert in amy of the traditional and modern                 
              areas of biological sciences.  It is designed to provide students              
              with their first exposure to the actual practice of scientific                 
              research in the hopes that the excitement and challenge of the                 
              enterprise will convince them to consider basic research in the                
              sciences as a viable career choice.  In the spring each student is             
              matched with a research project proposed by a preceptor with an                
              active research program in the students stated area of interest.               
              Upon acceptance, each student is provided with a reading list of               
              current publications in the selected area to provide the background            
              required for the proposed summer research project.  During the                 
              Program students are:  1) acquainted with current issues in                    
              biological research; 2) provided with the opportunity to acquire               
              and practice valuable scientific techniques and skills, many of                
              which can be utilized in their future endeavors; 3) required to                
              work independently toward their research goals; 4) encouraged in               
              cross disciplinary approaches to their projects by providing                   
              opportunities for interaction with other students and the whole of             
              the research staff at the Foundation; and 5) mentored in an                    
              educational setting which is maximally challenging and thus,                   
              fosters each student's exploration of future career choices in                 
              science.  In addition to the required written report detailing the             
              progress made in their individual research projects, each student              
              presents a short oral report to the Faculty and public summarizing             
              the results of their effort at a closing convocation and award                 
              ceremony.
