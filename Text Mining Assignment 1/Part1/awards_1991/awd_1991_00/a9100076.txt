Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The deposition of highly formable ceramic coatings on sheet metal              
              by Ion Beam Assisted Deposition (IBAD) suggests that these                     
              coatings may ultimately supplant painting or anodizing in many                 
              roll-coating operations.  The process has been used to synthesize              
              alumina, zirconia, and boron nitride coatings on various                       
              substrates at temperatures a low as room temperature.                          
                                                                                             
              This research effort will examine the ductility behavior of                    
              potentially superplastic IBAD coatings as they are affected by                 
              IBAD parameters (the parameters that govern formability).  The                 
              work will be coordinated with vendors to assure that practicable               
              processes capable of producing acceptable industrial coatings are              
              developed.
