Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The aim of the proposal is to explore the potential of multilayer              
              structures by studying their synthesis by sputter deposition with              
              in-situ characterization as well as measurement of their mechanical            
              properties.  Grazing incidence X-ray scattering is used to examine             
              the surface and interfaces during deposition.  The films are                   
              synthesized with alternating face-centered cubic and body-centered             
              cubic metal pairs.  These films offer the opportunity to study                 
              strengthening by finely spaced obstacles that inhibit dislocation              
              motion and relating this strengthening to film epitaxy, film                   
              thickness and misfit strains.  A strength in the program is the use            
              of an in-situ analysis  technique, which could lead to new                     
              understanding of film growth.
