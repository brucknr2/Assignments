Abstract    :
              Professor Irving R. Epstein and other members of the Chemistry                 
              Department of Brandeis Uniersity are being supported to conduct                
              a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in                        
              Chemistry.  For the period 1991-93, ten undergraduate students                 
              will spend ten weeks each summer actively engaged in a variety                 
              of research projects.  Projects range from studies of                          
              long-range order in proteins and surfactants to the chemistry                  
              of interstellar space.  Students will be required to present                   
              both oral and written reports on their research.  Extensive                    
              follow-up plans will encourage and monitor the participants'                   
              interests in a career of research and teaching in the chemical                 
              sciences.
