Abstract    :
                   This work will continue nuclear theory research relevant to               
              heavy-ion collisions at intermediate and high energies.  The                   
              topics include developing a stochastic treatment of quantum                    
              propagators, string model simulations of ultra-relativistic                    
              nuclear collisions and quasi-classical approximations of the                   
              quantum Liouville equations.
