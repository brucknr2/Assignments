Abstract    :
                   In this project the principal investigator will continue his              
              study of vector fields that are homogeneous with respect to a                  
              dilation in order to apply these results to the approximation of               
              solutions of nonlinear differential equations and control                      
              systems.  In particular, he will study the existence of                        
              asymptotically stabilizing feedback controls for nonlinear                     
              systems via homogeneous approximations, and then he will attempt               
              to construct such feedback controls for systems that are small-                
              time locally controllable about their uncontrolled rest state.                 
              The construction of asymptotically stabilizing feedback controls               
              remains one of the fundamental problems of control theory.                     
                   Control systems are a common feature of modern everyday                   
              life.  Think of the thermostat in your home that controls the                  
              furnace or the air-conditioner.  Many of these control systems                 
              are governed by linear equations, and for them there is now an                 
              extensive and nearly complete theory.  On the other hand, many                 
              technologically important control systems are nonlinear, that is,              
              the process to be controlled is governed by a nonlinear equation               
              or system of equations.  For nonlinear control systems the theory              
              is far from complete.  In this project the principal investigator              
              will seek approximate solutions of nonlinear control problems by               
              means of sophisticated methods based upon linear system theory.
