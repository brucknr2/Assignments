Abstract    :
                   In this project the principal investigator will examine                   
              various questions involving function theory in Bergman spaces.                 
              In particular, he will seek to establish a theory for the Bergman              
              space A**2 that is analogous to the classical theory for the                   
              Hardy space H**2.  His work will build upon recent results based               
              on the concept of "domination", which in the context of Bergman                
              spaces plays the same role as does the concept of boundary values              
              in the context of Hardy spaces.                                                
                   Various important problems in the theory of functions                     
              involve the notion of a Hardy space.  A Hardy space is a set of                
              holomorphic functions whose squares are integrable.  Recently                  
              researchers have discovered that a different class of functions,               
              called a Bergman space, shares many of the properties of Hardy                 
              spaces.  In this project the principal investigator will continue              
              to develop a theory for Bergman spaces that is analogous to the                
              classical theory of Hardy spaces.
