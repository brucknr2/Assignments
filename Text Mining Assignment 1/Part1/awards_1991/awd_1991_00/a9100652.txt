Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Description:  This project provides support for Dr. Ling to                    
              travel to Pakistan and to conduct preliminary investigation                    
              with scientists from the Geological Survey of Pakistan in                      
              Karachi and Quetta.  The field work seeks to recover                           
              siliceous microfossils, which would be the first such                          
              recovery from that region.   The ophiolites in Pakistan                        
              represent a part of the major geosuture, and the results                       
              would provide a basis for direct comparison with those from                    
              India and Indonesia where similar analyses are currently                       
              underway with collaboration of international scientists.                       
              These combined data will contribute toward temporal and                        
              spatial interpretation of tectonic history of the entire                       
              Southern and Southwest Asia.                                                   
                                                                                             
              Scope:  The collaboration between the U.S. scientist and                       
              the Pakistani geologists provides for a more effective                         
              research and a better use of resources.  Dr. Ling's                            
              participation will help the Pakistani scientists improve                       
              their own investigations.  This project meets the                              
              objectives of the Science in Developing Countries Program.
