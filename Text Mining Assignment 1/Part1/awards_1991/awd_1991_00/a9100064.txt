Abstract    :
                   Using the optimal choice of experimental conditions or of                 
              arrangements of experimental units or material maximizes the                   
              precision of the inferences drawn from the experiment.  This                   
              research will construct mathematically designs which are                       
              efficient and robust in the presence of correlations among                     
              adjacent experimental units, designs based on clustering                       
              techniques which are efficient and also permit detection of                    
              departures from model assumptions, and designs which can be used               
              simultaneously or subsequently to separate effects of factors or               
              combinations of factors which are confounded in an initial                     
              fractional factorial screening experiment.
