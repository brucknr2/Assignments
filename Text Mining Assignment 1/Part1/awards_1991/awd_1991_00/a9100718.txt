Abstract    :
                   Travel funds are provided for Professor Lai to travel to                  
              fermilab and Padova, Italy, to work on the analysis of data                    
              from the Fermilab Collider.  The data will be used to continue                 
              the search for the quark known as "Top".  An international team                
              is working on the search and Professor Lai has had a                           
              particularly close association and productive with the Padova                  
              group, which he will continue.
