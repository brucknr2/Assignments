Abstract    :
              A major goal of this project is to train and educate the next                  
              generation of scientists.  An integral part of the educational                 
              program is to provide a fulfilling research opportunity for                    
              undergraduate students.  It is strongly believed that this will                
              stimulate further science interests, instill excitement with                   
              scientific research, and promote future careers in the sciences.               
              This institution has a long standing history of providing                      
              research experience to undergraduates.  Over the past thirteen                 
              years many undergraduates have been hired to work in a variety of              
              research projects during the summer and acedemic year.  These                  
              students have continued their careers in physics, astrophysics,                
              computer science, and electronics.  During the past four years                 
              alone 15-20 undergraduates have been hired on a part-time basis                
              to assist with observatory and research projects.  Being selected              
              as a NSF REU site for the summers of 1987-90 has enabled the                   
              normal summer hiring of students to be expanded to a full-scale                
              summer program for students, which is similar in size to that of               
              the National Observatories.  This is not an apprenticeship                     
              program but a tutorial in research experience.
