Abstract    :
                   This three year grant is to establish a Research Experiences              
              for Undergraduates (REU) Site at the NASA Goddard Space Flight                 
              Center.  The research objective is to investigate the energy                   
              release, particle acceleration, and energy transport processes                 
              that occur in solar flares.  The principal focus will be on 1)                 
              understanding the nuclear physics of solar flares both by                      
              laboratory measurements of relevant cross sections and by the                  
              theoretical modelling of the various nuclear reactions; 2) the                 
              analysis of multiwavelength observations of solar flares                       
              including X-rays, microwaves, and H-alpha emissions and their                  
              interpretation in comparison with various theoretical flare                    
              models; and 3) the development of advanced new instrumentation                 
              for hard X-ray imaging using both temporal and spatial modulation              
              techniques.  It is hoped that five or six undergraduates will be               
              able to participate in this program.
