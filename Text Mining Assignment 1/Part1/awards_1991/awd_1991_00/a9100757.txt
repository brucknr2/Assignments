Abstract    :
              Professor Gregory D. Gillispie and other members of the                        
              Chemistry Department of North Dakota State University are being                
              supported to continue a Research Experiences for Undergraduates                
              (REU) site in Chemistry.  For the period 1991-93, ten                          
              undergraduate students will spend ten weeks each summer                        
              actively engaged in a variety of research projects.  Projects                  
              will be in the areas of organosilicon chemistry, NMR                           
              spectroscopy, laser spectroscopy, theoretical calculations on                  
              main group species, gas phase chemical dynamics,                               
              photooscillating systems, supercritical fluid applications to                  
              solvation phenomena, gas phase ion chemistry, synthetic organic                
              chemistry, and electrochemistry with microelectrodes.  Students                
              will participate in weekly research group meetings and present                 
              the results of their work at a final symposium and at regional                 
              poster sessions.  Students will be from four-year colleges in                  
              the upper midwest.
