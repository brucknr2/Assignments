Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Pacific Science Association (PSA) is a non-governmental,                   
              multinational society dedicated to the study of scientific                     
              problems of particular pertinence to the Pacific region.  A                    
              major, on going activity of the PSA is to organize, every                      
              four years, a major Pacific Science Congress.  The Congress                    
              represents the major means through which the PSA meets its                     
              stated objective of promoting cooperation and communication                    
              in science and technology among the communities of the                         
              region.  The XVII Pacific Science Congress will be held in                     
              Honolulu from May 27 to June 2, 1991, the first time the                       
              Congress has met in the United States since 1961.  Titled                      
              "Towards the Pacific Century: The Challenge of Change," the                    
              Congress will feature major symposia on such topics as global                  
              environmental change, biological diversity, health and social                  
              change, natural disasters, and technologies for development.                   
              In view of the profound economic and social changes currently                  
              in evidence throughout the Pacific region, and the interactions                
              of science and technology with those changes, the Honolulu                     
              Congress is expected to be a highly significant event.  This                   
              grant will enable conference organizers to provide travel                      
              support to prominent scientists from the less developed                        
              countries of the region to participate in the Congress as                      
              invited speakers.
