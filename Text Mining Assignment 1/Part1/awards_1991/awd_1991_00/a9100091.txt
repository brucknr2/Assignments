Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The objectives of this proposed research are                                   
              to: (1) provide the effective guidance for                                     
              repairs and rehabilitation of buried lifeline                                  
              structures for seismic resistance; (2)                                         
              provide technical information for realistic                                    
              evaluation of the vulnerability of existing                                    
              buried lifeline structures under various                                       
              seismic environments; and (3) develop and                                      
              document cost-effective methodologies for                                      
              repairing and strengthening such vulnerable                                    
              structures.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              Buried lifelines which include water, sewer,                                   
              gas and oil pipelines have been damaged                                        
              heavily by earthquakes including the 1985                                      
              Mexico City Earthquake, the 1987 Whittier,                                     
              California Earthquake and the most recent                                      
              Loma Prieta Earthquake of October 17, 1989.                                    
              Existing buried lifelines are unsafe even                                      
              under moderate earthquakes.  Because of the                                    
              importance of lifelines to the health,                                         
              supply, and safety of the public, lifeline                                     
              earthquake engineering needs greater                                           
              attention.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              Since there is still no codified seismic                                       
              provision to design buried lifelines, most                                     
              water and sewer pipelines, including                                           
              relatively new ones, have been built with                                      
              minimum earthquake protection.  Damages to                                     
              water and sewer pipelines during earthquakes                                   
              are unavoidable and economical loss can be                                     
              substantial.  Effective repair methods under                                   
              emergency situations and for a permanent                                       
              basis are to be addressed by this project.                                     
              Due to the fact that the replacement of all                                    
              existing water and sewer pipelines is very                                     
              expensive, if not impossible, the development                                  
              of effective rehabilitation techniques and                                     
              strategies to be developed by the proposed                                     
              research is urgently needed.
