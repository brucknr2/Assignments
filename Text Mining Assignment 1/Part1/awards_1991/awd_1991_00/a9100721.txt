Abstract    :
                   This Research Experiences for Undergraduates project will                 
              engage students in research focusing on the solution of matrix                 
              systems.  The mathematics serves as the basis of diverse scientific            
              applications such as differential equations, computational                     
              complexity and optimization, to name a few.  Following an                      
              orientation, students will be introduced to recent developments in             
              decomposition techniques for solving matrix equations.  These                  
              involve iterative methods for which convergence estimates must be              
              made in advance.  Much of the testing will require computational               
              experimentation.  This will allow students to become familiar with             
              a variety of on-campus computers which we be available to them.                
              Schemes for solving quadratic programming problems will be                     
              addressed as the mathematics develops.                                         
                   Two of the four advisors will be mathematicians from Spelman              
              College.  The two from Georgia Tech are faculty in the School of               
              Industrial and Systems Engineering.  The project will be funded                
              jointly by the Operations Research and Production Systems program              
              of the Engineering Directorate and the Division of Mathematical                
              Sciences.
