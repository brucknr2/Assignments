Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This renewal grant is in support of research in computational                  
              statistical mechanics.  A variety of projects will be studied which            
              are amenable to solution using advanced computational techniques.              
              Techniques will be developed and refined for the large scale                   
              simulation of phase transitions in systems with competing                      
              interactions.  Dynamical critical phenomena will be studied.  Other            
              research topics wil include capillary condensation, high resolution            
              Ising model simulations, finite size effects in the classical                  
              Heisenberg model, random systems, magnetic superlattices and                   
              surface phase transitions.  Various techniques will be used to                 
              implement these simulations including Monte Carlo, Monte Carlo                 
              renormalization group, molecular dynamics and spin dynamics.                   
              Computational simulations of systems composed of many particle                 
              represent an alternative to the usual theoretical calculations and             
              experimental investigation.  The principal investigator on this                
              grant is an accomplished expert on simulations of physical                     
              phenomena.  The principal investigator will study a variety of                 
              current problems in statistical mechanics which are amenable to                
              solution using computational simulation and will also develop                  
              associated algorithms to facilitate these simulations.  The                    
              research topics are of intrinsic interest in condensed matter                  
              physics in addition to having possible application to magnetic                 
              materials, surface behavior of materials and algorithm development.
