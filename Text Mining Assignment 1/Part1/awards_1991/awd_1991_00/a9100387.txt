Abstract    :
              Professor Edith J. Parsons and other members of the Chemistry                  
              Department at Clemson University are being supported to start a                
              Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in                          
              Chemistry.  For the period 1991-93, ten undergradaute students                 
              will spend ten weeks each summer actively engaged in a variety                 
              of research projects.  Some of the projects involve use of                     
              microwave energy to effect chemical reactions, synthesis of                    
              organocopper and organophosphorous compounds, analysis by                      
              atomic spectroscopy, and characterization of metal oxides                      
              formed using sol-gel procedures.  Faculty-student interactions                 
              will be fostered through activities such as informal luncheon                  
              presentations, departmental seminars, and optional minicourses.                
              Students will present the results of their research at a                       
              closing symposium.
