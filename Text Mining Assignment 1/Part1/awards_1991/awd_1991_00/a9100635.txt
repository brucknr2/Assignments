Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project develops and tests a model of factors producing the               
              transition from feudalism to capitalism in fifteenth century                   
              Tuscany.  The model incorporates both demographic factors (such                
              as population pressure) and social factors (such as contracts                  
              between landlords and tenants).  Results of the analyses will                  
              help refine theories of modernization, including those em-                     
              phasizing religion and bureaucratization (Weberian), those                     
              emphasizing effects of population (demographic), and those                     
              emphasizing relation to the means of production (Marxist).
