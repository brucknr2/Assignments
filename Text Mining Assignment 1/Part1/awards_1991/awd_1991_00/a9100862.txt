Abstract    :
              This award provides funds to support undergraduate students at                 
              Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory for an intensive ten-week long                   
              summer research experience.  The students are housed on grounds                
              and each one is assigned to a permanent Laboratory staff member                
              to perform an independent research project in the mentor's field               
              of expertise.  Each student begins his or her project with the                 
              advisor's close guidance and is subsequently encouraged to work                
              independently.  This allows students to develop to their full                  
              potential and to sample first hand the excitement of experimental              
              science.  During the program, the students present two series of               
              seminars:  one in which the students describe their proposed                   
              research and a final series in which the results of each project               
              are summarized.  There is also a series of seminars specifically               
              for the undergraduates in addition to daily lectures given as                  
              part of the Laboratory series of post-graduate biology courses.                
              This undergraduate research program is very oversubscribed and,                
              therefore, focuses on selection of individuals who, with proper                
              direction, are likely to make a contribution to science in their               
              ensuing careers.  Strong emphasis is placed on recruiting                      
              minorities to encourage them to pursue scientific careers.
