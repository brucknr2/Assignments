Abstract    :
              This two year continuing award supports software capitalization                
              for the continued development of benchmarks for evaluation of                  
              image processing systems.  The tasks include investigation of the              
              performance of new system designs and design modifications,                    
              concentrating on massively parallel architectures and                          
              the "software" image processing systems which run on                           
              high-performance workstations under UNIX, MS/DOS, and Apple                    
              Macintosh operating systems; expansion of the Preston-Seigart                  
              benchmark research to include a larger segment of the image                    
              processing community; and conduct of a trend analysis on hardware              
              and software architectures to determine what                                   
              areas of image processing research are likely to produce the most              
              cost-effective platforms.  The results of this project will be                 
              fed back to the participating organizations and also                           
              disseminated through professional publications, conference                     
              presentations, and liaison with professional society and                       
              industrial standards committees.
