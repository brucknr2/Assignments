Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will continue his research on the              
              variational bicomplex. This theory was first introduced                        
              approximately fifteen years ago to provide a uniform approach to               
              multi-integral problems in the calculus of variations. The                     
              bicomplex has also been used to solve inverse problems in calculus             
              of variations. The variational bicomplex plays a role in the                   
              geometric theory of differential equations somewhat analogous to               
              the role played by the deRham complex in finite dimensional                    
              manifolds. This theme will be developed in the research with                   
              application to specific examples a primary source of motivation.               
                   It is often useful to create a "calculus" or formalism which              
              can be applied to a large number of problems of a class. The                   
              formalism being studied in this research applies to the class of               
              problems known as variational problems. These problems arise                   
              naturally in a very wide range of circumstances in natural science.            
              A simple example would be the problem of determining, among all                
              curves on a surface connecting two points, the one with  the                   
              shortest length.
