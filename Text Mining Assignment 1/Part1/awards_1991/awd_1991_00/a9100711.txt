Abstract    :
              The University Press of New England is planning to produce a new               
              publications series "Studies in Arctic Affairs," starting in 1991.             
              A distinctive feature of the series will be publication of                     
              translations of significant and broadly appealing works from                   
              contemporary Soviet literature.  This grant provides support to                
              assist in the inaugural activities of translating several major                
              Soviet books.  This support is consistent with the NSF                         
              responsibilities to assist in the dissemination of Arctic knowledge            
              and its leadership role under the Arctic Research and Planning Act             
              of 1984.
