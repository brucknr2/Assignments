Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will support a three-day workshop on intelligent                    
              structural systems in Como, Italy toward the end of June                       
              1991.  The workshop is being organized by Professor Yi-Kwei                    
              Wen of the University of Illinois at Urbana and Professor                      
              Favio Casciati of the Universita di Pavia, Italy.  The                         
              objective of the workshop/seminar is to review progress to                     
              date and propose directions for further research in various                    
              areas including the utilization of knowledge-based expert                      
              systems for the monitoring, control and assessment of                          
              structural systems.  The main thrust will be on the utilization                
              of recent analytical/numerical methods, high-tech hardware,                    
              and expert systems to ensure better performance of existing                    
              and next generation structural systems.                                        
                                                                                             
              Construction (including buildings and structures and other                     
              civil works) is probably the largest industry in the world.                    
              Recent reports indicate that the investment in this area                       
              amounts to 10% of the world's gross domestic product.                          
              Structures generally have longer service life, and are not as                  
              easily replaced compared with any other kinds of commercial                    
              products.  Yet technology to monitor and maintain the health                   
              of the buildings and structural systems has been practically                   
              non-existent compared with other major commercial products such                
              as automobiles.  There have been recent developments in the                    
              areas of analytical/numerical modeling and response analysis                   
              of structural systems under loadings, including the effect of                  
              uncertainty in both loading and resistance.  At the same                       
              time, new technologies and hardware have been invented that                    
              make real time sensing, monitoring, assessment and control of                  
              structural systems possible and feasible.  By exchanging                       
              information and promoting the introduction of new ideas and                    
              concepts, this workshop has the potential to lead to new                       
              developments, applications and implementation of existing                      
              technologies.
