Abstract    :
              This research is to study communications and control requirements              
              for multiple autonomous robots to cooperate in accomplishing a                 
              task, where the robots are organized heterarchically instead of                
              using the more common hierarchical (master/slave) control.  Each               
              behaves reactively, in accordance with sets of relatively                      
              primitive motor schemas.  The resulting organization does not                  
              require an explicit world model, and should be more robust and                 
              hence more suitable for operations in remote and/or hazardous                  
              environments.  A key research issue is to evaluate the efficacy                
              of such systems operating under constrained inter-agent                        
              communications.  Such agents could be more economical to operate.              
              The goal of the research is to understand and develop control and              
              communication mechanisms that produce robust yet efficient                     
              cooperative robot behavior.
