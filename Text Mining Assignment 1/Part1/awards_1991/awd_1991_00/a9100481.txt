Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              In the study and analysis of building damage                                   
              after an earthquake, the total economic loss                                   
              incurred in a building can be determined for                                   
              various structural types based on field data.                                  
              However, little research work to date, if                                      
              any, has been accomplished to segregate                                        
              economic losses among various building                                         
              elements such as structural versus                                             
              nonstructural, mechanical, interior/exterior                                   
              finishes and cladding, etc.                                                    
                                                                                             
              This project focuses on filling this                                           
              knowledge gap by: (a) analyzing damage                                         
              patterns in actual buildings, (b) developing                                   
              a detailed classification of the types and                                     
              locations of typical building damage                                           
              patterns, and (c) quantifying losses among                                     
              the various subsystems of a building such as                                   
              the basic structure, exterior cladding,                                        
              interior finishes, mechanical components, and                                  
              other nonstructural elements which compose                                     
              the entire building system.  This research                                     
              will provide a specific mechanism for                                          
              differentiation and quantification of                                          
              subsystem damage patterns within the total                                     
              building system.  Results anticipated will                                     
              enhance our understanding and ability to                                       
              retain the proper balance between cost and                                     
              risk in the seismic design of architectural                                    
              components and systems.
