Abstract    :
              Professor John L. Hogg and other members of the Chemistry                      
              Department of Texas A&M University are being supported to                      
              continue a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site                  
              in Chemistry.  For the period 1991-93, nine undergraduate                      
              students will spend ten weeks each summer actively engaged in a                
              variety of research projects.  Projects include chromatography                 
              of chiral molecules, reactions of tellurium compounds, and the                 
              folding mechanism of proteins.  The program will feature a                     
              lecture series and tours of local chemical industries.                         
              Students will give both oral and written reports of their                      
              summer research progress.  Participants will be predominantly                  
              two-year college students and minorities.
