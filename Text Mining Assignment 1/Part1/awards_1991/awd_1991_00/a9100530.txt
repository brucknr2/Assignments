Abstract    :
              Current approaches to uncertainty management in AL and expert                  
              systems largely ignore the dynamics of large-scale problem                     
              solving.  For example, much research has focused on the problem                
              of computing the answer to a single query or set of queries,                   
              given a static problem model.  However, advanced work in large                 
              scale problem solving, such as story and image understanding,                  
              reveals that such queries are interspersed in a larger stream of               
              model specifications/reformulations and evidence assertions.                   
              This research has as its goal the understanding of the                         
              functionalrequirements for uncertainty management at this higher,              
              task- oriented level, and the development of uncertainty                       
              management systems which provide efficient support for these                   
              requirements.
