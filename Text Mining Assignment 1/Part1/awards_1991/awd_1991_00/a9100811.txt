Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will work in several areas of                  
              probability theory, including Brownian motion and random walk.                 
              Four specific problems are addressed:  the porosity of certain                 
              sets associated with a Brownian motion, weak and strong limit                  
              theorems for trimmed sums, the overshoot of d-dimensional random               
              walk, and the expected lifetime of Brownian h-paths.                           
                   The principal investigator will work in several areas of                  
              probability theory, including Brownian motion and random walk.                 
              The investigators previous work has been in the classical area of              
              probability theory, limit theorems.  Limit theorems are used both              
              in statistics and in other areas of probability, here in random                
              walk.  Questions concern the long run behavior of the sums of                  
              random quantities.
