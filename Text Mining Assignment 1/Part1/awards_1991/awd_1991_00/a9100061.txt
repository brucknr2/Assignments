Abstract    :
                   This grant will enable several young researchers, women and               
              minorities to attend and participate in the Third Meeting of the               
              Canadian Number Theory Association to be held August, 1991 at                  
              Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario.  The conference will focus              
              on three areas of Number Theory:  analytic number theory;                      
              arithmetic algebraic geometry; and diophantine approximation.  The             
              lectures will provide speakers with the opportunity to explain                 
              their recent unpublished results, thus providing a forum for                   
              communicating and discussing new discoveries.
