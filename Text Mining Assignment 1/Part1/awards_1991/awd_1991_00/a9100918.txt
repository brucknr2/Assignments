Abstract    :
                   This project will bring 10 undergraduate students to the                  
              University of Nebraska for 10 weeks during the Summer of 1991                  
              to do research into databases, information retrieval, and                      
              expert systems.  The format of this ten week summer program                    
              includes formal instruction (lectures and seminars) in the                     
              morning and active research in the afternoon.  Sample                          
              projects include: "Inference Mechanisms Based on a                             
              Multivalued Scale of Certainty", "Techniques for Dealing                       
              with Imprecision, Uncertainty, and Information Incompleteness                  
              in Query Processing", "Integrating Database Management                         
              Systems with Information Retrieval Systems" and Incorporating                  
              a System-User Adaptation Mechanism into the Pure Boolean                       
              Information Retrieval Process.
