Abstract    :
                   This project will support 8 students for a two semester                   
              sequence to do research in parallel processing.  The first                     
              semester is an intensive summer spent at the Parallel                          
              Processing Institute of the University of Oklahoma.                            
              Students continue their research back at their home                            
              institutions during the Fall semester with weekly reporting                    
              to their research advisors by email and phone.  Sample                         
              research projects include: (1) Algorithms for Graph                            
              Embedding, (2) Benchmarking Broadcast Algorithms on the                        
              Hypercube, (3) Randomized Algorithms, and (4) Developing                       
              Portable Parallel Software.
