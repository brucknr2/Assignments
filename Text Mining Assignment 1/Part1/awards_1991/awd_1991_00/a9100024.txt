Abstract    :
              This project is part of a collaborative effort to obtain long-                 
              term (2 years) observations of ocean circulation and atmospheric               
              forcing, in anticipation of an intensive experiment planned for                
              the Western Pacific Warm Pool in late 1992/early 1993, called                  
              TOGA-COARE (Coupled Ocean Atmosphere Response Experiment).  Long-              
              term measurements will begin in late 1991, and continue until well             
              after the intensive experiment is completed, providing the overall             
              environmental context for the intensive experiment.  In this                   
              component, together with colleagues at NOAA's Pacific Marine                   
              Environmental Laboratory, and the University of Hawaii, the P.I.               
              will deploy and maintain an array of sub-surface moorings equipped             
              with upward-looking Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers, which will             
              provide data on the circulation in the upper 250 meters in a                   
              region near that of the intensive experiment.
