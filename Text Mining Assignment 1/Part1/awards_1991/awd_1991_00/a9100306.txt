Abstract    :
              This award is one of a group of three in support of the research               
              program at the Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland (BIMA) millimeter wave               
              interferometer.  A consortium of three major universities, the                 
              University of California at Berkeley, the University of Illinois,              
              and the University of Maryland have pooled their resources, both               
              financial and human, to develop an outstanding astronomical                    
              facility, clearly a world leader in millimeter wave interferometry.            
              The program funded here will utilize the existing three-element                
              aray as it is expanded to nine telescopes.  Investigations will                
              study objects ranging from our sun and planets in our solar system             
              to distant galaxies.  The instrument and software reduction                    
              packages will also be made available to users outside the BIMA                 
              consortium.
