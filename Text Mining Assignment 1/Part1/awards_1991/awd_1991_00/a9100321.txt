Abstract    :
                   This grant supports the research of Professor S. Ashford to               
              work on problems in algebraic number theory.  In particular she                
              will concentrate on algorithms for deciding the ramification in                
              quartic number fields.                                                         
                   This is research in the field of number theory.   Number                  
              theory starts with the whole numbers and questions such as the                 
              divisibility of one whole number by another.  It is among the                  
              oldest fields of mathematics and it was originally pursued for                 
              purely aesthetic reasons.  However, within the last half century,              
              it has become an essential tool in developing new algorithms for               
              computer science and new error correcting codes for electronics.
