Abstract    :
                   This project is concerned with several problems in matrix                 
              theory.  The principal investigator will investigate G-norms                   
              and G(c)-radii; unitary similarity orbits, numerical range and                 
              numerical radius; and linear preserver problems.                               
                   This research is in the general area of matrix theory.                    
              A matrix is a rectangular array.  Matrices can be used to                      
              represent a wide variety of situations in mathematics,                         
              engineering, statistics, physics, economics and the life and
