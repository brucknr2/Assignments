Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The proposal is directed toward the investigation of a novel                   
              and highly selective membrane for the continuous recovery and                  
              purification of valuable proteins such as beta interferon from                 
              complex and dilute mixtures.  Use of such a membrane would                     
              represent a substantial improvement in the downstream                          
              processing of proteins produced using cell-culture or                          
              fermentation processes.
