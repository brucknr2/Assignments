Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              An eight-week project of Research Experiences for Undergraduates               
                                                                                             
              will be supported by this award.  Six undergraduates will work on              
                                                                                             
              problems in probability theory.  The topics are distinct but                   
              interrelated having a strong theoretical component with                        
              significant applications.  The project will run for eight weeks.               
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
              A mainframe computer will be available for large scale                         
              computations as well as several microcomputers for local access                
              and word processing.  Symbol-manipulative programs such a MAPLE                
              and MACSYMA will be available for testing conjectures.                         
                                                                                             
              Each student project will derive from two basic areas of inquiry.              
                                                                                             
              First, the exact distribution theory of runs and patterns and                  
              second, the celebrated Chen-Stein method of Poisson and Gaussian               
                                                                                             
              approximation.  Applications of results to statistics or                       
              cryptography will be encouraged.  It is expected that students                 
              will be given two general problem areas.  They will follow the                 
              more promising through the project.                                            
                                                                                             
              One criterion for student selection will be their willingness and              
                                                                                             
              desire to spend a substantial amount of time after the formal                  
              completion of the project in writing up results obtained and to                
              present them at professional meetings in which student research                
              papers are on the agenda.
