Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project examines the role of middle class actors in promot-               
              ing or retarding social change.  PIs will interview about 100                  
              black teachers in South Africa on their attitudes toward student               
              protests and apartheid, and will analyze their responses by                    
              several indicators of social position of the teachers (such as                 
              age, income, and gender).  Results will enable contrasting                     
              predications from theories which see middle class actors as                    
              essentially conservative to other predications which predict                   
              heavy middle class involvement in social change movements.
