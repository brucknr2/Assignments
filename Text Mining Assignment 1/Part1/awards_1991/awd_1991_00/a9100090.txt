Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Recent public policy discussions have raised                                   
              concerns over the insurability of quake                                        
              damages and the extremely low level of                                         
              earthquake insurance purchase by small                                         
              business.  At the same time, very theoretical                                  
              issues have been raised about the use of                                       
              deterministic loss estimates, especially                                       
              worst-case ones, in insurance evaluation                                       
              procedures, especially for earthquake.  These                                  
              theoretical issues suggest that deterministic                                  
              decisions, decision made in ignorance of                                       
              probabilities, may encourage adverse                                           
              selection and discourage risk                                                  
              diversification, such as coverage of numerous                                  
              small properties with geographical spread.                                     
              To examine these issues, and also to clarify                                   
              superior risk tools now available for                                          
              earthquake, quantitative models for both                                       
              insurers and small businesses will be                                          
              developed and examined using these models to                                   
              determine whether or not and under what types                                  
              of program constructs earthquake insurance                                     
              would be feasible for post-disaster recovery                                   
              of small businesses.  This quantitative                                        
              approach should further assist in clarifying                                   
              the concept of insurability.
