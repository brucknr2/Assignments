Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will continue his work in the                  
              general area of extreme values, inference and stochastic models                
              with broad overlap between the different areas.  Several of the                
              proposed problems are concerned with the interplay between extreme             
              value theory, point process methods, asymptotic theory and                     
              applications of these ideas to time series analysis and choice                 
              theory.  In addition, the investigator will work on problems of                
              random sets and multidimensional problems.                                     
                   The principal investigator will continue his work in the                  
              general area of extreme values, both from the inference as well as             
              from the stochastic model point of view.  This area of research                
              falls in the interface between statistics (inference) and                      
              probability (stochastic models).  One particular application of                
              this work will be to time series analysis.
