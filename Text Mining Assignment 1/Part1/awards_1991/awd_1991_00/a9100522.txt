Abstract    :
              The Scripps Institution of Oceanography of the University of                   
              California - San Diego, will receive support for shipboard                     
              technician activities associated with the four research                        
              vessels operated by the University.  A significant portion of                  
              the ships' operating schedules in recent years and again in                    
              1991 is in support of NSF-sponsored research projects.  The                    
              Shipboard Technician Program has two components: an at-sea                     
              component and an ashore component.                                             
                                                                                             
              The at-sea component consists of instructing scientific                        
              personnel in the use of shared shipboard equipment; maint-                     
              enance, repair, and calibration of scientific instrumenta-                     
              tion; instruction and supervision of deck operations; and                      
              providing logistics assistance to on-coming and off-going                      
              scientific parties.  On shore activities include the mainten-                  
              ance, repair, and calibration of shared use seagoing equip-                    
              ment and assisting scientific personnel in preparing for                       
              field work on the vessel.  Shipboard technicians funded by                     
              this award have broad responsibilities for providing the                       
              coordination and assistance needed for the successful                          
              completion of research projects at sea.  The level of                          
              activity and amount of support are closely related to the                      
              size and capability of the vessel, and its scientific outfit                   
              and capability.
