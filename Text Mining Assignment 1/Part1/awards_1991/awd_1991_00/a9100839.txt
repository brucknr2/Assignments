Abstract    :
                   Estimation of accuracy of a statistical inference gives a                 
              revision of the usual probability statement (for example: p-value,             
              or confidence coefficient) based on formalizing the statistical                
              basis for evaluating such data-dependent measures.  In this                    
              research these notions of conditional inference will be extended to            
              multiple inference problems from multiple comparisons procedures to            
              meta-analysis.
