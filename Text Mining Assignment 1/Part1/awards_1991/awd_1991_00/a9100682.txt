Abstract    :
                   With funding from this award, the Bureau of Labor Statistics              
              will provide NSF with projections of demand for scientists and                 
              engineers under three alternative assumptions that will be developed           
              as part of the regularly scheduled update to the BLS projections.              
              The projections will cover the 1990-2005 period.  The alternative              
              assumptions will be broad macro or demographic in nature.
