Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will study isoparametric                       
              submanifolds of Riemannian manifolds. A submanifold of Euclidean               
              space is isoparametric if its normal bundle is flat and the                    
              principal curvatures along any locally defined normal vector field             
              are constant. The research will use topological methods to                     
              construct new examples of isoparametric submanifolds in the finite             
              and infinite dimensional case.                                                 
                   This research in a classical area of differential geometry                
              attempts to explain and classify ways in which manifolds or                    
              surfaces sit inside space. In particular, the research will                    
              consider families of surfaces which fill space in layers which are             
              curved in a fixed way. Such surfaces appear, for example, as layers            
              in composite materials. The methods to be used in the study come               
              from a wide range of areas such as algebraic topology and group                
              theory.
