Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A Symposium is proposed that is designed to bring together an                  
              international group of experimentalists and theorists interested in            
              new ideas and results that pertain to nanostructures and mesoscopic            
              systems.  Topics will range from physics to fabrication techniques.            
              A core of some sixteen invited speakers will help determine the                
              main themes of the meeting.  In addition, a dozen or so talks will             
              be selected from the contributed papers, the remainder of which                
              will be presented in a poster session.  It is planned to limit the             
              number of participants to about 175.  A proceedings will be                    
              published in due course.                                                       
                                                                                             
              The field, which is relatively new, is of great fundamental                    
              scientific interest.  There are also very important technological              
              implications for such areas as semiconductor devices, electronics,             
              binary optics, smart sensors, etc.
