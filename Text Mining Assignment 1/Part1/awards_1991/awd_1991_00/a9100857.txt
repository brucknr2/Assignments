Abstract    :
                   This project will provide a summer's research experience for              
              eight undergraduate geology majors.  Of the participants, three to             
              four of the students and two of the faculty involved, will be from             
              schools other than Furman.  These outside participants will be                 
              drawn from the geology programs of schools that belong to two                  
              consortia of which Furman is a member.  Faculty involved will work             
              with one or two students to direct them in a 9-week research                   
              effort.  As the summer progresses, the student will be encouraged              
              to become increasingly more independent.  The goals of each effort             
              will be to produce valid verifiable results that will contribute               
              to the body of knowledge in geology and that can be presented to               
              the scientific community in the form of a presented paper or                   
              journal article.
