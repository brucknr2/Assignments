Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                     This project will develop a chronology for the Paleogene by            
              integrating magnetostratigraphy, stable isotope stratigrajphy,                 
              Sr.isotope, and biostratigraphy. the stratigraphic goal is to                  
              developa Paleogene time scale, and to test biostratigraphic                    
              correlations between low and high latitudes. In addition, the                  
              work has the paleoceanographic goal of reconstructing deep.and                 
              surface.water fluctuations by makeing synoptic faunal and isotope              
              comparisons across two climat transitions, the Paleocene/Eocene                
              boundary and the late middle Eocene to early Oligocene.
