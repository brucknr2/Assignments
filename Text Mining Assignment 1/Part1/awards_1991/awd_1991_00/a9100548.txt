Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This RUI proposal is focused on Neurospora mutants that are                    
              deficient in several blue-light mediated processes, and that                   
              accumulate a compound of unknown chemical identity in the growth               
              medium; this compound does not accumulate in either albino mutants,            
              or wild-type cells.  The research will be focused on isolation and             
              identification of the chemical structure of this metabolite and its            
              role in blue-light regulated processes; radiochemical approaches               
              to determining precursor-product relationships will be employed,               
              as they will also in assessing the effects of the metabolite on                
              synthesis of carotenoid pigments in "white-collar" mutants.
