Abstract    :
                   This project continues and expands the very successful                    
              REU site program at the San Diego Supercomputer Center to a                    
              Southern California regional REU site.  Twenty students will                   
              be brought to SDSC for 10 weeks during the summer of 1991 to                   
              work on research projects in a variety of areas of                             
              computational science.  Students are teamed with faculty                       
              advisors form their home institutions as well as SDSC                          
              researchers.  This program interfaces with other summer                        
              programs on the UCSD campus.  Research project areas include                   
              modelling human locomotion, electron transfer interactions,,                   
              fluid dynamics, visualization of earthquake dynamics, and                      
              neural networks.
