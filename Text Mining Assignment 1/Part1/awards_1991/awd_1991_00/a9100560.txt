Abstract    :
              The University of Alaska, Institute of Marine Science will                     
              receive renewed support for shipboard technician activities                    
              associated with the research vessel ALPHA HELIX, a 133-foot                    
              ship that is owned by the NSF and operated by the University.                  
              A significant portion of the ship's operating schedule in                      
              recent years and again in 1991 is in support of NSF-sponsored                  
              research projects.  The Shipboard Technician Program has two                   
              components: an at-sea component and an ashore component.                       
                                                                                             
              The at-sea component consists of instructing scientific                        
              personnel in the use of shared shipboard equipment; mainten-                   
              ance, repair, and calibration of scientific instrumentation;                   
              instruction and supervision of deck operations; and providing                  
              logistics assistance to on-coming and off-going scientific                     
              parties.  On shore activities include the maintenance,                         
              repair, and calibration of shared use seagoing equipment and                   
              assisting scientific personnel in preparing for field work on                  
              the vessel.  Shipboard technicians funded by this award have                   
              broad responsibilities for providing the coordination and                      
              assistance needed for the successful completion of research                    
              projects at sea.  The level of activity and amount of support                  
              are closely related to the size and capability of the vessel,                  
              and its scientific outfit and capability.
