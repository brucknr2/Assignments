Abstract    :
              This award will support US participation in a US-UK workshop                   
              on the topic or rehabilitation robotics, to take place in                      
              Cambridge, England in April 1991.  The co-organizers are:                      
              Dr. Richard Howell, Ohio State University and Dr. Ray Gosine,                  
              Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge.                            
                                                                                             
              The rapidly expanding research area which has been termed                      
              "rehabilitation robotics" is dedicated to the development of                   
              functional robotic assistive tools for use by severely                         
              physically disabled individuals in home, work or educational                   
              environments.  As a new area of endeavor, rehabilitation                       
              robotics is composed of information from the disciplines of                    
              engineering, rehabilitation, education and computer science.                   
              The task of merging these disparate areas into a cohesive                      
              effort is made more difficult by the few operational research                  
              projects from which to draw information, and which are quite                   
              isolated from one another throughout the world.  The proposed                  
              workshop will feature an international gathering of research                   
              scientists in rehabilitation robotics, who will present                        
              summaries of current research efforts and discuss a series of                  
              topics focusing on the disabled use of robotic devices.  The                   
              topics will include:  the user interface, safety issues in                     
              robotic environments, the needs and perceptions of the users,                  
              and user acceptability of robotic devices.  In addition,                       
              sessions are proposed on the current progress in hardware and                  
              software, and aspects related to commercialization of robotic                  
              systems.
