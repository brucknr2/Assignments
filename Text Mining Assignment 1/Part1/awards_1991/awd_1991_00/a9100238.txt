Abstract    :
                   Professor Jones will work on the Iwasawa theory of elliptic               
              curves.  He intends to study problems related to Iwasawa L-                    
              functions of l-adic representations.  He will also study                       
              equivariant cohomology with a view towards finding analogues of                
              flat duality theorems.                                                         
                   This project falls into the general area of arithmetic                    
              geometry -a subject that blends two of the oldest areas of                     
              mathematics: number theory and geometry.  This combination has                 
              proved extraordinarily fruitful - having recently solved problems              
              that withstood generations.  Among its many consequences are new               
              error correcting codes.  Such codes are essential for both modern              
              computers (hard disks) and compact disks.
