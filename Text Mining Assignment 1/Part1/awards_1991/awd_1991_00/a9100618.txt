Abstract    :
              This project addresses the topic of adaptive control of robots.                
              Specifically, if focuses on instability mechanisms in the                      
              adaptive control of robots and teleoperators.  These instability               
              phenomena arises from external disturbances and unmodeled                      
              dynamics.  The phenomena to be investigated include slow                       
              parameter drift instabilities, high gain instabilities, fast                   
              adaptation instabilities, bursting, and others.  Various                       
              techniques including singular perturbation theory and averaging,               
              integral manifolds, network theory and scattering theory will be               
              used to understand the basic phenomena.  Experiments will be                   
              conducted on robotic devices to test theory.  Ultimately, it is                
              expected that understanding these instability phenomena will be a              
              factor in the design and implementation of robust controllers for              
              robots.
