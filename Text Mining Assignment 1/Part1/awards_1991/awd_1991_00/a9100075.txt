Abstract    :
              Optical instruments for performing linewidth                                   
              measurement or for finding the geometry of small                               
              features are limited by the resolution associated with                         
              the wavelength of light.  Basic optical theory states                          
              that features smaller than one-half of the illumination                        
              wavelength are unresolvable.  However, information                             
              is present in the image about higher spatial                                   
              frequencies than given by the optical resolution.  By                          
              measuring phase rather than intensity, 0.3 to 0.5 um                           
              features can be measured with an interferometric                               
              optical microscope.  Information about higher spatial                          
              frequencies may be extracted by applying image                                 
              processing techniques such as simulated annealing,                             
              linear and nonlinear least-squares estimation, and the                         
              Gerchberg algorithm.  The aim of this research is to                           
              apply these techniques in an interferometric optical                           
              profiler to extend the range of submicron linewidth                            
              measurements down to 0.1 um.  An applicable                                    
              technique would be useful in a commercial product.                             
              Possible applications include the measurement of                               
              integrated circuit or integrated optical device                                
              geometries as well as measurement of pits in compact                           
              disk masters, and magnetic recording head geometry.
