Abstract    :
              This award provides funds to continue an REU program which is                  
              designed to provide highly motivated undergraduates, especially                
              women, and minorities with the opportunity to develop their                    
              skills as archaeological field scientists while working within                 
              the context of the Naco Valley Archaeological Project, NW                      
              Honduras.  The project focuses on student conduct of a                         
              significant independent research project, from the enunciation of              
              a hypothesis to final write-up, supported by in-field class                    
              instruction and a living and working situation in which                        
              interaction among students and research leaders is easy and yet                
              intense.  This course of study is founded on the Principal                     
              Investigator's considerable experience in collaborating with and               
              instructing undergraduates within field settings in the past, and              
              especially, on NSF-REU site projects which took place during the               
              1988 and 1990 Naco Valley seasons.                                             
                                                                                             
              Ultimately, the goal for the project is to help students grow                  
              from neophyte research assistants to junior colleagues confident               
              in their ability to make independent research decisions and                    
              contribute to scientific knowledge.  The 1988 and 1990 efforts,                
              which form the model of the current program, were successful in                
              accomplishing these objectives.
