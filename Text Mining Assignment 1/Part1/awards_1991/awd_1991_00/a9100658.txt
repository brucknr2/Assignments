Abstract    :
              The establishment of a REU Site (Research Education for                        
              Undergraduates) is proposed for the University of California at                
              Santa Barbara as part of the Palmer Station Antarctic Marine LTER              
              (Long-Term Ecological Research) project.  The purpose of the REU               
              Site is to involve undergraduates in both the field seasons in                 
              Antarctica, and in the laboratory at UCSB during sample analysis,              
              data analysis and preparation of publications.  The LTER and REU               
              programs have several common objectives which are achieved by                  
              undergraduates participating in research activities.                           
              Undergraduates with an interest in marine sciences will have the               
              opportunity to experience all aspects of an interdisciplinary                  
              project with strong hypothesis testing, and which involves                     
              current and evolving techniques.  During this experience we                    
              expect that students will move from a broad overview and                       
              dependent status to a narrower focus and independent projects.
