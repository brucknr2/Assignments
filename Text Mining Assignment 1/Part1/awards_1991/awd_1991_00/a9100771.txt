Abstract    :
              In this program, undergraduate engineering students participate in             
              research projects in the laboratories of members of the Biomedical             
              Engineering Department of the Johns Hopkins University.  Opportunities         
              are available for basic research on biomedical instrumentation, sensors,       
              prosthetics, biomaterials, biomechanics, neurophysiology, and neural           
              modeling, cardiovascular physiology and modeling, mathematical modeling,       
              and membrane and cellular physiology.  Students are recruited from             
              institutions in the Baltimore-Washington area, including Johns Hopkins         
              University, Morgan State University and Howard University.  Special            
              effort is made to attract underrepresented groups to the program.              
              Participants work under the day-to-day supervision of faculty members          
              on research projects which the students have developed under the               
              guidance of a faculty mentor.  Students discuss their research projects        
              in a weekly seminar series which gives students experience in presenting       
              research plans and results and in discussing their work with their             
              peers.  A limited number of students will present results of their             
              projects at national meetings,, with financial support from the School         
              of Engineering.
