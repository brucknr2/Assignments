Abstract    :
              Professor Thomas Keyes is supported by a grant from the                        
              Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to perform                     
              theoretical studies on liquid state dynamics. Keyes has                        
              developed a new technique for performing dynamical studies of                  
              the liquid state which depends on harmonic normal mode                         
              analysis.  This new methodology has been applied to supercooled                
              liquids where existing dynamical theories have shown limited                   
              success, and it is capable of yielding an Arhhenius activation                 
              energy for self diffusion.  The technique will be developed                    
              further to treat several other dynamical quantities including                  
              rotational diffusion, spectral linewidths, and the                             
              identification of the region of cooperative rearrangement.  A                  
              secondary topic which will be studied is the computer                          
              simulation of laser ablation of silicon and diamond.  These                    
              ablation simulations will lead to a more detailed picture of                   
              the energy redistribution within these materials, and the                      
              mechanism for thermal and nonthermal laser action.

              The focus of this project is the dynamics of motion in the                     
              liquid state.  The research has an important bearing on the                    
              dynamical factors which control chemical reactions in the                      
              liquid state or in solutions.
