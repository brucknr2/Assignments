Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Low molecular weight hydrocarbons, labeled with deuterium, will be             
              synthesized and isomerized in order to determine the intimate                  
              details of the mechanisms of the isomerization reactions.                      
              Stereochemical and kinetic data will be used to assess the course              
              of these isomerizations. One- and two-centered stereomutation                  
              processes of cyclopropane will be studied with deuterium labeled               
              chiral trans-1,2-diethynylcyclopropane. The stereochemistry of the             
              isomerization pathways of allene, cyclopropene, spiropentane,                  
              vinylcyclopropane, and bicyclo ?3.1.1! hept-2-ene will be studied              
              with the appropriately deuterium labeled and chiral molecules.                 
              Also, the four possible stereochemical pathways available for the              
              vinylcyclopropane to cyclopentene thermal isomerization will be                
              quantified. These molecules are sufficiently small that high                   
              level molecular orbital calculations can be used in conjunction                
              with the experimental results for a better understanding of these              
              processes. New experimental techniques, vibrational circular                   
              dichroism and tunable diode laser spectroscopy, will be brought to             
              bear on these problems.                                                        
                                                                                             
              This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the                      
              continuing research of Professor Baldwin at the University of                  
              Syracuse. This research will study the details of the                          
              reorganization (isomerization) of atoms in small molecules that                
              contain only carbon, hydrogen, and deuterium. The results of these             
              studies can be compared to high level theoretical calculations in              
              order to gain further insight about these reactions.
