Abstract    :
                   This project will involve 8 undergraduate students in                     
              the following areas of research being conducted at the                         
              departments of Physics and Computer and Information Science                    
              (CIS) of Syracuse University, the Honors Program, the                          
              Syracuse Center for Computational Science (SCCS), and the                      
              Northeast Parallel Architectures Center (NPAC): (1) parallel                   
              computing software and algorithms, (2) pattern recognition                     
              and computer vision, (3) neural networks, (4) computational                    
              condensed matter physics, (5) high Tc superconductivity, (6)                   
              nonlinear dynamics (chaos), and (7) computers in education.                    
              Five faculty and three postdoctoral research fellows will                      
              supervise REU participants and at least three of the eight                     
              participants will be selected from outside of Syracuse                         
              University.
