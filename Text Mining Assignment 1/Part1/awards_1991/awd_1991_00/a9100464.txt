Abstract    :
              This award supports an international workshop on salt lake                     
              ecosystems to be held in Bolivia in March, 1991.  The U.S.                     
              organizer is Stuart Hurlbert of San Diego State University.                    
              His counterpart in Bolivia is Carlos Arce of the League for                    
              the Defense of the Environment.  In addition there is an                       
              organizing committee consisting of three other scientists,                     
              three from Bolivia and one from France.  The participants                      
              include scientists from a wide spectrum of disciplines                         
              ranging from brine geochemistry to crustacean systematics to                   
              avian ecology.  They represent 24 different countries; 19                      
              arefrom Latin America, 32 from North America, 22 from                          
              Europe,4 from Africa, 4 from the Mideast, 5 from Russia, 6                     
              from Australia and 7 from Asia.                                                
                                                                                             
              The workshop will include contributed and invited talks,                       
              panel discussions, field trips to saline lakes and a six-day                   
              excursion after the meeting to view saline lakes and the                       
              general geography of the altiplano (high plane).  This is the                  
              first of these symposia to be held in Latin America and                        
              therefore represents an important opportunity for Latin                        
              American scientists to interact with U.S. and world scientists                 
              in this field.  In this way, this activity fulfills the goals                  
              of the Science in Developing Countries program.
