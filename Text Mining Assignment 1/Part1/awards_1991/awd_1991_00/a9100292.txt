Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project explores the origin of magnetic anisotropy in                     
              ultrathin iron films deposited on single crystal tungsten                      
              substrates using ultra-high vacuum sputtering techniques.  The                 
              films will be characterized in-situ during deposition and                      
              subsequent crystallization using grazing incidence X-ray scattering            
              to monitor the crystallization process and to monitor lattice                  
              accommodation and the number and orientation of crystal                        
              dislocations generated.  Magnetic anisotropy measurements will be              
              made and correlated with microscopic structural features.  A second            
              part of the project is devoted to incorporation and study of the               
              effects of rare earth atoms at the iron-tungsten interface.  Rare              
              earth atoms at the interface in dilute amounts have the potential              
              to produce large magnetic anisotropy, and this effect will be                  
              studied.  The dominating importance of interfacial effects in films            
              which are only a few atomic layers thick can in principle be used              
              to tune the magnetic anisotropy and magnetic moment of a given                 
              sample to a desired value.  Since the mean free path of electrons              
              in these multilayer media may be substantially longer than the                 
              layer thicknesses, remarkable electron transport properties, such              
              as the giant magneto resistance effect have been observed.  Many of            
              the properties of multilayer ultrathin films are of interest for               
              technological application, especially for data storage either                  
              magnetic or magneto optic.
