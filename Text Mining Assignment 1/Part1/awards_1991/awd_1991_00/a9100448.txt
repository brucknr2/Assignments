Abstract    :
                   The University of Southern California will support shipboard              
              technician activities associated with the R/V VICKERS, a 220-foot              
              research vessel that is owned and operated by the University.  USC             
              has been converting the VICKERS to a research vessel from a tuna               
              clipper over the past five years.  Nearly all of the ship's                    
              operating schedule during 1991 is in support of NSF- sponsored                 
              research projects.  Some extra effort will go into setting up new              
              scientific equipment and getting the ship ready to do science.  The            
              Shipboard Technician Program has two components: an at-sea                     
              component and an ashore component.                                             
                   The at-sea component consists of instructing scientific                   
              personnel in the use of shared shipboard equipment; maintenance,               
              repair, and calibration of scientific instrumentation; instruction             
              and supervision of deck operations; and providing logistics                    
              assistance to on-coming and off-going scientific parties.  On shore            
              activities include the maintenance, repair, and calibration of                 
              shared use seagoing equipment and assisting scientific personnel in            
              preparing for field work on the vessel.  Shipboard technicians                 
              funded by this award have broad responsibilities for providing the             
              coordination and assistance needed for the successful completion of            
              research projects at sea.  The level of activity and amount of                 
              support are closely related to the size and capability of the                  
              vessel, and its scientific outfit and capability.
