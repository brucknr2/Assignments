Abstract    :
                   Ten students will receive support from this Research                      
              Experiences for Undergraduates award.  They will work under the                
              direction of three faculty advisors for a period of two summer                 
              months.  In the preceding award, institutional support for five                
              additional students was provided; a similar arrangement is                     
              anticipated with the receipt of this grant.  Much of the                       
              experimental work involves computational work which will be                    
              carried out in the Mathematics Computer Assisted Learning Center.              
              The center has excellent computer and software resources                       
              available to the researchers.                                                  
                   The primary theme used during the first year to exemplify                 
              the experimental nature of mathematical research will be                       
              computational and combinatorial group theory.  Here computers                  
              have not only been used to check examples and discover patterns                
              but also to settle problems which have been reduced to a finite                
              number of cases.  After an orientation period, students will                   
              begin work on problems concerning the Mobius function of finite                
              groups, finding the number of reduced expressions in the Coxeter               
              generators for elements of the affine Weyl group and, along a                  
              more geometric line, to look at the Hurwitz problem for finite                 
              simple groups of small order.  This final area concerns the                    
              problem of determining all possible genera of closed, orientable               
              surfaces which admit a symmetry by the group.
