Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This x-ray diffraction system is suitable for powder diffraction               
              experiments, single crystal and thin film work, and is equipped                
              with a full Eulerian specimen carrier for texture measurements.                
              Access to this fully automatic, user-friendly system will be made              
              to faculty and students throughout the University, in need of rapid            
              specimen characterization, and will be incorporated in a teaching              
              laboratory for training of students.                                           
                                                                                             
              Materials research efforts currently underway include: the local               
              arrangement of point defects in non-stoichiometric oxides; studies             
              of mercury-cadmium-telluride II-IV semiconductors to determine the             
              state of local chemical order and atomic displacements; studies in             
              iron-nickel-carbon steels to elucidate the effects of carbon                   
              ordering on matensite formation and determination of phase                     
              fractions and lattice paramaters of steels; determination of                   
              periodicities in two dimensions in metal-metal, metal-ceramic, and             
              metal-semiconductor interfaces; residual stress measurements in                
              microcracking ceramics, and phase characterization of zirconia                 
              oxide thermal barrier coatings.
