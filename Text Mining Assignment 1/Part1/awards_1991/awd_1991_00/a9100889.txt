Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Elemental analyses of carbon and nitrogen in oceanographic                     
              research crosses the disciplines of biology, chemistry, and                    
              geology and involves a diverse array of sample types including                 
              laboratory-grown microbial (e.g. bacteria, phytoplankton,                      
              protozoa) and zooplankton biomass, water column particulates,                  
              sediment trap material, surface microlayer samples, and benthic                
              core samples.  For scientists at WHOI such measurements play                   
              pivotal roles in studies on phytoplankton and bacterial nutrient               
              dynamics, primary production, water column nutrient cycling,                   
              microbial food chain dynamics, water column particulate                        
              transformations and fluxes, hydrothermal vent biology and                      
              chemistry, petroleum geochemistry, air-sea exchange processes,                 
              and benthic-water column interactions.  We are requesting a new                
              CHN elemental analyzer that will be shared by a diverse group of               
              WHOI scientists from 4 different departments.
