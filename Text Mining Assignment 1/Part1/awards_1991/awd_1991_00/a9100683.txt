Abstract    :
              This applicant plans to study the occurrence and mechanism of                  
              negative regulation of cellular functions by the formation of                  
              steroid receptor heterodimers.  Negative interactions of                       
              progesterone on estrogen-induced functions will be used as the                 
              model system.  The work is planned to take place in the                        
              laboratory of Dr. Jan-Ake Gustafsson at the Karolinska Institute.
