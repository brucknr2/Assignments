Abstract    :
              The College of Engineering at Texas A&M University has a REU program for       
              ten women and minority students.  The REU program is conducted in              
              conjunction with an ongoing Undergraduate Summer Research Program,             
              sponsored by the Texas Engineering Experiment Station for the past nine        
              years, and the Minority Engineering Program.  Students for the REU             
              Program are selected from institutions that have predominantly minority        
              enrollments including the University of Texas at El Paso, University of        
              Texas at San Antonio, Pan American University, University of Puerto            
              Rico, and Prairie View A&M as well as Texas A&M University, with at            
              least half from other institutions.  Individual research projects are          
              undertaken by the undergraduate students in conjunction with on-going          
              research programs, and regular faculty involved in these programs serve        
              as advisors for the participants' research activities.
