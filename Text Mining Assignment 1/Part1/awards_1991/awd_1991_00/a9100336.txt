Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will continue his work on the                  
              structure of random walk paths in two and three dimensions.  The               
              particular objects of interest are critical exponents for these                
              walks:  the intersection exponent, which measures the probability              
              that two independent walks intersect; the chemical exponent, which             
              measures the length of the shortest subpath between two points; the            
              resistance exponent; the loop-erasing exponent, which measures the             
              length of a path derived from erasing loop chronologically; and                
              exponents related to the behavior of a particle diffusing on a                 
              random walk path.  The investigator will also study clusters formed            
              from random walk dynamics.                                                     
                   The principal investigator will continue his work on the                  
              fractal-like structure of random walk paths in two and three                   
              dimensions.  This is an area of probability theory that draws                  
              heavily on heuristic models in physics and chemistry for                       
              motivation.  Results in this area will impact both the probability             
              community and the theoretical physics community.  One object of                
              interest is the intersection exponent of a random walk, which                  
              measures the probability that two independent walks intersect.
