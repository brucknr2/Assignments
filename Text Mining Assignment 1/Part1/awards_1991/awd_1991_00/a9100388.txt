Abstract    :
              Professor Reed J. Blau and other members of the Chemistry                      
              Department of the University of Texas at Arlington are being                   
              supported to establish a Research Experiences for                              
              Undergraduates (REU) site in Chemistry.  For the period                        
              1991-93, eight undergraduate students will spend eleven weeks                  
              each summer actively engaged in a variety of research projects.                
              Projects range from organometallic chemistry and biochemistry                  
              to synthesis and characterization of polymeric materials.                      
              Students will earn three hours credit for their work,                          
              participate in weekly seminars, and visit area research                        
              laboratories.  Both oral and written reports will be required.
