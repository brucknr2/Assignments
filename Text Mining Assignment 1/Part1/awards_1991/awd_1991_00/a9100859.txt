Abstract    :
                   SAGE (Summer of Applied Geophysical Experience) is a                      
              university-level research experience focused on modern                         
              geophysical exploration.  The emphasis is on hands-on, research-               
              scale, advanced learning.                                                      
                                                                                             
                   The SAGE field area in the Rio Grande rift near Santa Fe,                 
              New Mexico provides a stimulating tectonic research environment                
              as well as an opportunity to study occurrences of groundwater and              
              hydrocarbons.  SAGE students participate in every phase of the                 
              field research from the collection and processing of data to its               
              interpretation culminating with both an oral and written report.               
              NSF supported REU students first complete the three-week field                 
              segment of SAGE.  They then return to their home campuses where                
              research continues on data that they have collected.                           
                                                                                             
                   SAGE is sponsored by the Los Alamos National Laboratory                   
              (LANL) Branch of the Institute of Geophysics and Planetary                     
              Physics of the University of California and five universities                  
              who furnish faculty and over $2,000,000 worth of geophysical                   
              equipment.
