Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              PI proposes to increase understanding of diamagnetism in non-                  
              uniform interacting electronic systems.  The following problems                
              will be addressed:  1) ground state properties of electrons in an              
              external magnetic field;  2) possibility of instabilities leading,             
              in the absence of a magnetic field, to a ground state with                     
              spontaneous orbital currents and broken time-reversal symmetry; 3)             
              energetics of magnetic field-induced non-uniform collective states             
              in three dimensional electron and electron-hole liquids.  Method to            
              be employed is current-density functional theory of inhomogeneous              
              electronic systems in magnetic fields.
