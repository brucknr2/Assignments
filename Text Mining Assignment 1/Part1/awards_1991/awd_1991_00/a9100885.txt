Abstract    :
              This award supports a workshop on the geology of the James                     
              Ross Basin, Antarctica.  The sedimentary rock sequence                         
              exposed within the James Ross Basin is a nearly continuous,                    
              richly fossiliferous record ranging in age from Late                           
              Cretaceous through Eocene.  Prior studies have demonstrated                    
              the significant role Antarctica  played in the evolution and                   
              dispersal of southern hemisphere terrestrial and marine                        
              organisms as well as in the evolution of global                                
              oceanographic conditions.  However, the work has been                          
              performed by groups from various nations with little                           
              coordination.  As a result the terminology applied to                          
              geological and geographic features in confusing and the work                   
              has been repetitive and overlapping, in some cases.  Because                   
              it is recognized that cooperative work, involving scientists                   
              from several nations, would permit more efficient and                          
              economical use of financial and logistic resources, a                          
              workshop will be held to provide an opportunity to discuss                     
              research completed and to define objectives for gaining a                      
              greater understanding of the area.  It is anticipated that                     
              such a workshop will encourage research planning for future                    
              expeditions.
