Abstract    :
              In this proposal, number-theoretic techniques are considered to                
              provide hardware modularity that facilitates high data rates,                  
              testability, reliability and fault tolerance in VLSI design. A                 
              research program is proposed that will address questions of                    
              reliability and fault tolerance on both the integrated circuit and             
              the higher system level. Modular designs of a convolutional                    
              back-projection (CBP) digital processor for synthetic aperture                 
              radar (SAR) image processing will be studied as vehicles to address            
              both circuit and system level fault tolerance, and to study the                
              interaction between circuit level error checking and system level              
              fault tolerance mechanisms.
