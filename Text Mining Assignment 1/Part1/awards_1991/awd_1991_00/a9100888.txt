Abstract    :
                   This research program will determine the role of internal                 
              ionic regulation in maintaining the positive buoyancy of large                 
              oceanic diatoms, Rhizosolenia, using a combined laboratory and                 
              field program.  Previous work has shown that diatoms of the                    
              genus Rhizosolenia are positively buoyant, and that this buoyancy              
              can be described by a size- dependant function of cell sap                     
              density and silicification.  This program will follow the                      
              buoyancy response of positively buoyant diatoms to light and                   
              nutrient (N, P, Si) manipulations.  The resulting changes in                   
              direction and rate of movement will be related to variations in                
              the cell sap ionic composition and concentration of internal                   
              nutrient pools.  Diel studies will measure the temporal variation              
              in buoyancy to determine its potential effect on the vertical                  
              positioning of cells in relation to life-cycle phenomenon.  The                
              potential for vertical migration in these diatoms for utilization              
              of deep nitrate pools will be specifically addressed in                        
              laboratory and field experiments.  This work represents the first              
              focused analysis of positive buoyancy in diatoms, a class of                   
              plankton previously assumed to be incapable of directed upward                 
              movement in the euphotic zone.
