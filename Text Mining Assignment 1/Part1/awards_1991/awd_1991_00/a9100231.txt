Abstract    :
              With this award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting                   
              the research of Dr. Andrew G. Myers in the Department of                       
              Chemistry at the California Institute of Technology.  The                      
              research encompasses three separte areas, each designed to                     
              investigate a new strategy or chemical reaction in organic                     
              synthesis.  Dr. Meyers will further develop radical-cyclization                
              methodology in which an aldehyde and an alcohol are covalently                 
              bonded through an O-silyl hemiselenoacetal intermediate.                       
              Studies will be carried out on an aldol process that leads to                  
              anti-aldol condensation and, hopefully, a "chiral catalytic                    
              aldol" reaction will emerge.  Third, a transannular radical                    
              cyclization will be used for the construction of the cembranoid                
              natural product epoxybasmenone.                                                
                                                                                             
              Dr. Meyers will study areas of synthetic methodology that focus                
              on new carbon-carbon bond forming reactions, a silicon-                        
              directed aldol condensation reaction and the development of                    
              transannular radical cyclization reactions.  If successful, the                
              reactions will provide synthetic chemists with new and powerful                
              techniques for use in the construction of complex organic                      
              molecules.
