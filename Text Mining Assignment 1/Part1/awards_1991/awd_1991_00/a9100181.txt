Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will complete ongoing investigations of the role of               
              dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in oceanic carbon cycles.  Speci-               
              fically, radiocarbon (14C) and stable carbon isotope (13C) ratios              
              will be measured in two DOC pools:  the fraction oxidized by                   
              ultraviolet (uv) radiation, and the fraction oxidized by high-                 
              temperature (HT) combustion.  These isotopic signatures, coupled               
              with total DOC concentrations (uv and HT) and the 14C, 13C and                 
              15N signatures of sinking and suspended particulate organic                    
              carbon pools, will further our understanding of the sources and                
              rates of cycling of dissolved organic matter in the oceans.                    
                                                                                             
              Isotopic signatures (14C, 13C) and total concentrations will be                
              completed for DOC in seawater samples collected in the north                   
              central Pacific gyre, the Sargasso Sea, and the Santa Monica                   
              Basin off Southern California.  Additional measurements will be                
              made on samples to be collected in the Amazon River plume and                  
              from an open-ocean station in the northeast Pacific off Point                  
              Conception, California.  These latter measurements will be in                  
              conjunction with E. Druffel, WHOI, and J. Bauer, Florida State                 
              University.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              It is also planned to confirm the DOC-HT 14C measurements by                   
              other oxidation techniques, such as ultrasonication and Hg(II)                 
              complexation of chloride ion coupled with uv irradiation.                      
                                                                                             
              The goals of this project are directly related to those of the                 
              U.S. Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (GOFS).
