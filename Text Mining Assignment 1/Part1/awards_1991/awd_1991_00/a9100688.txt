Abstract    :
                   This grant supports research of the nuclear physics group                 
              at Notre Dame University, to be carried out at a number of                     
              different laboratories in the United States and France.  The                   
              primary areas of research are nuclear reaction studies with                    
              heavy ions and nuclear structure studies in heavy nuclei.
