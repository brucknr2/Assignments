Abstract    :
                   The Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution will operate the              
              research vessels EDWIN LINK and SEWARD JOHNSON in 1991.  In                    
              addition, they operate the submersible JOHNSON SEA-LINK and a ROV              
              (remotely operated vehicle).  These systems are operated as                    
              effective research platforms for a variety of NSF-sponsored                    
              research projects.                                                             
                   The research vessels will provide 45 days of ship time and 10             
              days of submersible time in support of NSF programs.  Additional               
              submersible and ship time will be provided as cost sharing by the              
              institution for the 1991 projects
