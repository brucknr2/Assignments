Abstract    :
              This REU SITE proposal requests support for eight undergraduates               
              to participate in archaeological analysis of animal bone remains,              
              stone artifacts, and medieval Norse artifacts at the Hunter College            
              Bioarchaeology Laboratory. The focus of the program will be on the             
              northern circumpolar zone, including collections from Iceland and              
              Kodiak Island, Alaska.  Students will develop skills in                        
              observation, quantification and scientific reasoning through                   
              contact with real archaeological collections and problems. The                 
              Hunter Bioarchaeology Facility has a 10-year record of attracting              
              women and minority students to the social sciences.
