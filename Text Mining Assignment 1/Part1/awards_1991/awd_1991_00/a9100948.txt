Abstract    :
                   This grant is for continued support of an REU site program                
              at the University of Alaska-Geophysical Institute.  The program                
              will be patterned after previous programs and gives                            
              undergraduates majoring in physics and closely related                         
              disciplines experience in research conducted at the Geophysical                
              Institute.  The program objectives are to acquaint students with               
              the exciting research opportunities in the various fields of                   
              geophysics, concentrating on Space Physics and Aeronomy, and                   
              encourage these students to go on to graduate school in these                  
              fields.  The program will include an organized series of informal              
              discussions to improve interaction and the sharing of ideas.
