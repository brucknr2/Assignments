Abstract    :
                   This grant supports the group of F.K. Lamb, C.J. Pethick                  
              and D. Pines for continuing work on a wide variety of topics                   
              involving astrophysical applications of microscopic and many-                  
              body physics.  The general area include fundamental properties                 
              of matter under extreme conditions, the physics of neutron                     
              stars, physics of accretion, and particle acceleration and                     
              nonthermal emission from astrophysical sources.
