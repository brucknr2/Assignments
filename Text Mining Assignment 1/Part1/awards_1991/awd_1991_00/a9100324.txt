Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will continue studying the                     
              relationship between symmetries of various fundamental partial                 
              differential equations and q-difference equations, the coordinate              
              systems in which it is possible to separate variables and the                  
              properties of the special functions that solve the separated                   
              equations.  In particular, the principal investigator will                     
              determine a practical definition of variable separation that                   
              applies to all systems of partial differential equations.  Next he             
              will attack the problem of intrinsic characterization of separable             
              coordinates.  Finally he will determine the special functions that             
              arise as solutions of the sets of separated equations and study                
              their properties.
