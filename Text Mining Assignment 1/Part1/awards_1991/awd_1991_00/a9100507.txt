Abstract    :
              This award provides funds to continue a Research Experiences for               
              Undergraduates Site in the Department of Psychology at                         
              Pennsylvania State University for another three years.  Eight                  
              undergraduate psychology majors with an interest in the                        
              biological aspects of experimental psychology will be recruited                
              to participate in this program at the completion of their                      
              sophomore or junior year.  An effort will be made to attract                   
              women and minority students using the techniques and contacts                  
              which have enabled staff to train over 43 minority Ph.D.s since                
              1969 and ten minority students in past REU programs.  The                      
              students selected will work as apprentices with one of eight                   
              members of the faculty, all nationally known for their research                
              and all highly experienced at preparing undergraduates who have                
              gone on to graduate school.  This faculty has received a major                 
              equipment grant from the U.S. Department of Education that has                 
              provided facilities for research and training.  The program is                 
              designed to have the students work full-time for eight weeks in                
              the summer, gradually exposing them to all aspects of                          
              psychophysiological research and to selected aspects of                        
              perception and cognitive and physiological psychology.  Students               
              will design an independent research project during the latter                  
              part of the summer and complete it with the help of their Penn                 
              State mentor during the following academic year.  At the end of                
              the spring semester, they will present their research results at               
              a department colloquium.  Every effort will be made to encourage               
              and assist students to gain admission to graduate programs.
