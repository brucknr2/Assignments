Abstract    :
                   The research to be carried out under this award is divided                
              into three parts.  Part A is concerned with problems of                        
              estimation and prediction for time series models whose theory is               
              not fully understood.  These include nonlinear, heavy tailed and               
              non-Gaussian processes, all of which play an important role in                 
              the modelling of real time series data.  The second Part deals                 
              with extreme value theory, and the application of ideas from                   
              point processes to analysis of linear, bilinear and generally                  
              stationary processes.  Results of the second part will help in a               
              better analysis of the first part.  Part C is concerned with                   
              processes arising in the modelling of storage systems and                      
              population growth.
