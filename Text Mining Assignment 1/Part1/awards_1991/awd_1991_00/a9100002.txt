Abstract    :
                   Over time in a location, common species tend to  remain                   
              common while rare species remain rare.  Biologists have long been              
              interested in determining what factors or processes regulate or                
              control population size.  Recently, the effect of human                        
              activities in decreasing the abundance of some species has                     
              become more apparent.  With increasing interest in protecting                  
              biological diversity has come an attempt to identify the factors               
              affecting the survival of rare and endangered species.                         
                   This research investigates the effects of population size on              
              the performance of individual plants within those populations.                 
              Two species of thistle occurring in the mountains of New Mexico                
              will be studied:  one a rare species (protected as a federally                 
              Threatened species) and the other a more common thistle of                     
              similar environments.  Populations of different sizes (ranging                 
              from 10 to over 3000 individuals) will be selected from known                  
              populations of the rare species;  individual plants within these               
              populations will be monitored. Similar observation will be                     
              carried out on artificial populations of the common species,                   
              which will be established with plants transplanted by the                      
              investigator.  Estimates of the rates of survival, seed                        
              production, and so on in these populations will be used in                     
              computer models to assess the viability (the chances for                       
              continued persistence) of extremely small populations of the                   
              threatened species.                                                            
                   This research will shed light on the processes that regulate              
              population size in plants, both common and rare.  The research                 
              will also test methods for assessing the viability of small                    
              populations.  Such techniques are essential for land managers and              
              government agencies making decisions about which species or                    
              populations are worthy candidates for conservation efforts.
