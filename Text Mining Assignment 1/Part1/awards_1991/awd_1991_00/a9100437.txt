Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              PI proposes experimental test of a new model of coalition for-                 
              mation in cooperative exchange networks.  Several earlier models               
              predict coalitions depending upon available communication chan-                
              nels.  This model adds several game theory considerations - most               
              importantly, side payments and concerns with equity - to  ratio-               
              nal actor considerations.  The experiments will enable com-                    
              parative assessment of predictions from this model and from                    
              earlier, competing models.  Potential applications include                     
              calculating the power of actors as a function of their organiza-               
              tional positions, and designing communication patterns to create               
              desired power positions in organizations.
