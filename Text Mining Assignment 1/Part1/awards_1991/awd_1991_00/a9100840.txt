Abstract    :
              The research program for undergraduates at Florida International               
              University is designed to stimulate and promote interest,                      
              curiosity, creative and critical thinking of undergraduate students            
              in environmental science and engineering during their early years              
              in undergraduate program.  This work involves students in a                    
              comprehensive research program relative to movement of oil spills              
              and treatment of contaminated media to minimize potential damage               
              to the environment.  The program engages students with different               
              areas of research relative to movement and treatment of oil spills.            
              The areas of research are in the following areas: environmental                
              biology, environmental physics, environmental chemistry,                       
              environmental modeling, and process design.                                    
              The research goals follow:  formulate a detailed mathematical model            
              to study the movement of oil spills and develop innovative                     
              treatment processes to minimize the potential impacts of the oil               
              spills in the environment;  conduct experiments to evaluate the                
              significance of physical, chemical, and biological parameters in               
              containment and treatment of oil spills;  evaluate the relative                
              significance of time and length scales for analyzing dynamics of               
              oil migration and study effectiveness of containment options and               
              treatment processes.
