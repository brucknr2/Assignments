Abstract    :
              This is the first U.S.-Taiwan joint workshop on solar                          
              variability effects on the atmosphere and space processing                     
              proposed by Dr. Shi Wu, the University of Alabama at Huntsville                
              and Dr. C. H. Liu, the Taiwan National Central University                      
              supported by the AIT-(U.S.) CCNAA-(Taiwan) Cooperative                         
              Science Program.  The Division of Atmospheric Sciences has                     
              contributed $6,000 to support this joint workshop.  This                       
              workshop covers topics important to the NSF research mission                   
              on global change and provides an opportunity for scientists                    
              to discuss the geophysical phenomenon occurring specifically                   
              in that region, such as the equatorial anomaly region.  It                     
              provides a forum to plan future research programs related to                   
              upper atmospheric research in this region of Asia and will                     
              increase cooperative research activities in this field                         
              between U.S. and Taiwan scientists.
