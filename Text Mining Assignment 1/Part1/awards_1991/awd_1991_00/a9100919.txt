Abstract    :
                   A program of summer research for undergraduates will be                   
              carried out at the University Research Reactor of the                          
              University of Missouri/Columbia.  The laboratory has a broad                   
              range of research projects, both pure and applied, with the                    
              basic technique involved--neutron research--tying them                         
              together.  A particular effort will be made to involve                         
              minority students.
