Abstract    :
                       The El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is the best                   
              example of a climate variation on earth that is produced by an                 
              internal feedback in the climate system.  With a quasi-periodic                
              oscillation of 2-6 years, it is also a climate variation that has              
              important human impacts.  The history of ENSO is well documented               
              for about the last 50 to 100 years from direct observation and                 
              the last 500 years from historical and other written anecdotal                 
              evidence.  It is important to understand how this internal                     
              feedback may affect future climate change.  In order to                        
              accomplish this, it will be necessary to extend the record of                  
              ENSO climate change back in time to understand how the system                  
              responds to varying climatic states.  This proposal will result                
              in a record of ENSO dating back to about 622 AD.  It will be                   
              based on the record of Nile River discharge measured at                        
              Cairo, Egypt. This research is important because it will provide               
              direct observation of natural climate variations on annual and                 
              decadal time scales.  The results will be most useful for                      
              understanding how the earth responds to short-term internal                    
              perturbations and how these responses might be affected by                     
              climate change.
