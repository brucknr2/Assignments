Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              In this Research Experiences for Undergraduates award, six                     
              students will concentrate on applications of probability to the                
              analysis of basic questions in group theory.  The principal goal               
              is one of determining in a probabilistic sense the likelihood                  
              that two elements of a group commute.  Specifically, the team                  
              will construct confidence intervals for the location parameter of              
              a symmetric random variable.  The method uses the notion of                    
              resampling introduced by Tukey for determining what are called                 
              typical values for the subsample means.                                        
                                                                                             
              To attack the problems, students will be introduced to the high                
              level programming language, CAYLEY, which enables the user to                  
              define algebraic structures in which various structural                        
              properties can then be classified.  This important tool is                     
              generally not available to undergraduates.                                     
                                                                                             
              Reports will be prepared at the end of the program.  Those                     
              students who have made significant progress will refine the work               
              into publishable form; efforts will be made to have students                   
              present their work at forthcoming professional meetings.  This is              
              the third year of support for this program.  Results to date have              
              been substantial.
