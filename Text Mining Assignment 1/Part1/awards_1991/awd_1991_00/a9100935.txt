Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The primary objective of this US-Poland research                               
              project between Dr. Ludwick Adamowicz of the University                        
              of Arizona and Dr. M. Nowak of the Physics Institute of                        
              the Polish Academy of Sciences is to study the tautomerism                     
              process in nucleic acid bases and their derivatives that                       
              occur spontaneously or are invoked by UV radiation.  The                       
              researchers intend to continue developing ab-initio                            
              quantum chemical techniques for more accurate calculations                     
              of electronic structures and of excited electronic                             
              states.  Many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) and                              
              coupled-cluster methods will be extended to study                              
              electron excitation processes and develop optimization                         
              techniques for correlation orbitals based on the                               
              Hylleraas functional.  The results are expected to                             
              develop theoretical methodologies that will be combined                        
              with experimental approaches of matrix isolation                               
              spectroscopy and extend understanding of the IR spectra                        
              of a group of molecules in the gas-phase, as well as to                        
              describe the mechanism of the interaction and chemical                         
              transformation of these molecules upon UV radiation.                           
                                                                                             
              This project in theoretical chemistry fulfills the                             
              program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by                         
              enabling leading experts in the United States and                              
              Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and pool                       
              research resources in areas of strong mutual interest                          
              and competence.
