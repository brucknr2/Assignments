Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will continue and expand a comparative study of                   
              similar, but geographically isolated, semi-arid montane                        
              ecosystems in the Peninsular Ranges within the Californian                     
              Biogeographic Province.  The Parque Nacional San Pedro Martir                  
              (SPM) in Baja California, Mexico, and the Mt. San Jacinto State                
              Park (SJ) in southern California have experienced profoundly                   
              different management regimes during the 20th century.  SJ has                  
              been subject to a fire suppression policy since 1900 and to an                 
              exclusion of domestic livestock since 1930; in contrast,                       
              wildfires remain uncontrolled in SPM but livestock grazing                     
              intensity is extremely high.  The project will evaluate the                    
              result of the differing management strategies on these two                     
              ecosystems.  Included will be continuing documentation of past                 
              and current human use of the two areas, reconstruction of the                  
              probable vegetation patterns of the sites prior to European                    
              exploitation (based on diaries from the Spanish mission period of              
              the late 18th century), and perfection of computerized geographic              
              information systems for the two areas.  The researchers will                   
              characterize elevational, latitudinal and longitudinal gradients               
              in both areas and will utilize satellite remote sensing data to                
              reconstruct regional fire histories.   The research will provide               
              for an understanding of the controls of biodiversity and of                    
              sustainable development in these important habitats and may be of              
              use in analyzing the probable of global environmental change.
