Abstract    :
              Analytical solutions will be developed for the effects on                      
              measured friction values of the offset between the friction                    
              force in the surface of a sliding system and the exterior                      
              force which is applied to overcome the friction.  The                          
              analysis will be based on the Greenwood-Williamson theory for                  
              asperity contact of randomly textured surfaces and on                          
              adhesion between contacting asperities as the friction                         
              mechanism.  The analytical solutions will be validated with                    
              experimental data.
