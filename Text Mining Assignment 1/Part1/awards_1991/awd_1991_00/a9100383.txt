Abstract    :
                   The School of Mathematics was formed in 1930 at the founding              
              of the Institute for Advanced Study, and many mathematical                     
              institutes founded both in the United States and abroad in the                 
              intervening decades were inspired by a desire to emulate the School            
              and its achievements.  The original purpose of the Institute was to            
              provide an environment exceptionally favorable for research by                 
              freeing scholars from teaching duties and by offering total freedom            
              in research plans and objectives.  More recently, a new goal of the            
              Institute has been to provide a post doctoral education for junior             
              Ph.D.'s.                                                                       
                   Although the School of Mathematics, as a part of the                      
              Institute, has a substantial endowment which is adequate for the               
              permanent faculty and the maintenance of an exceptionally agreeable            
              working environment, it does not suffice to support all the                    
              temporary members.  This grant will provide support to allow about             
              26 junior mathematicians to spend a year at the School of                      
              Mathematics.
