Abstract    :
              This award is made in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and                          
              Organometallic Chemistry Prorgam in support of the research of                 
              Dr. Myron Rosenblum of Brandeis University. The objective of                   
              the research is the design, synthesis and property                             
              characterization of a new class of sterically constrained                      
              metallocenes held in a face-to-face orientation. Such materials                
              are expected to have interesting electrical conductivity and                   
              possibly nonlinear optical properties.                                         
                                                                                             
              Triad molecules consisting of three such metallocene units                     
              either all identical (homonuclear) or different(heteronuclear)                 
              will be prepared.  The synthesis of homonuclear polymers                       
              composed of chains of such face-to-face metallocenes will also                 
              be carried out as well as those in which two different metals                  
              alternate in the polymer chain. Synthesis of branched-chain                    
              polymers in which cyclopentadienylmetal clusters containing                    
              two, three or four cyclopentadienylmetal centers form repeating                
              units within the polymer are planned.  Analogous metallocene                   
              systems derived from 2,2'-bis(metallocenyl)-1,1-binaphthyls                    
              will be made and studied.  These substances are capable of                     
              exhibiting electronic interactions either through the                          
              face-to-face conformation or through the binaphthyl rings, and                 
              are, in principle, preparable in optically active form.                        
              Collaborations are in place to characterize the electrical and                 
              magnetic properties of the polymers.
