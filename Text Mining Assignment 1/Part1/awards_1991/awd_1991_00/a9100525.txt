Abstract    :
              This award provides support to continue a Research Experiences                 
              for Undergraduates Site at the University of Michigan Biological               
              Station in Pellston, MI.  Ten undergraduates interested in                     
              research in field biology will be selected each summer to                      
              participate in the program.  Students will both learn and live at              
              the Station during the nine-week summer session.  The research                 
              experience will be the sole focus of their academic activities                 
              during that period.  The selected students will each work with a               
              faculty mentor, attend special REU evening workshops, attend REU               
              weekly discussion meetings, attend general seminars at the                     
              Station, and develop their own research project (from conception               
              of the ideas through data collection to verbal and written                     
              presentation of the study).  Students will be selected on the                  
              basis of academic excellence, letters of recommendation, and                   
              evidence of interest in research.  After participation in the                  
              program, each student would help in the evaluation of his/her                  
              experiences in the program.
