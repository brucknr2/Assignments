Abstract    :
                   The goal of this project is to continue and expand an                     
              undergraduate research effort in the Colorado Plateau and                      
              Transition Zone of Arizona that will involve students primarily                
              from Northern Arizona University, but also from other universities.            
              The research effort will focus upon geological mapping and                     
              environmental sciences.  This project will offer students the                  
              opportunity to make, compile, and interpret geological maps within             
              the context of a network of on-going collaborative research                    
              projects funded by the NSF and the U. S. Geological Survey.                    
              Mapping and map compilation will be performed by conventional                  
              techniques and by using computer-assisted mapping facilities.                  
              Environmental sciences undergraduates need field experience to                 
              collect data relevant to environmental problems, and hands-on                  
              analytical experience to analyze these data.  Supervision will be              
              supplied by pairing each student with a faculty supervisor/mentor,             
              but within the departmental research focus on the Colorado Plateau             
              and Transition Zone.  Continuity is important in developing top                
              researchers; students will be encouraged to start research as                  
              juniors (and occasionally as sophomores and continue throughout                
              their undergraduate program.
