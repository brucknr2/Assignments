Abstract    :
                   Professor Hida will work on the theory of p-adic Hecke                    
              algebras and their applications to Iwasawa theory of CM fields.  He            
              will also work on studying forms of half integral weight over                  
              totally real fields, the construction of p-adic symmetric square L-            
              functions and their application to the cyclotomic Z-p tower of                 
              these fields.                                                                  
                   This project falls into the general area of arithmetic                    
              geometry -a subject that blends two of the oldest areas of                     
              mathematics: number theory and geometry.  This combination has                 
              proved extraordinarily fruitful - having recently solved problems              
              that withstood generations.  Among its many consequences are new               
              error correcting codes.  Such codes are essential for both modern              
              computers (hard disks) and compact disks.
