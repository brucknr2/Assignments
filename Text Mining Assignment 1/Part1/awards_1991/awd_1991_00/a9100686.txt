Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will research the production of materials,                        
              restriction enzymes and competent cells that have a longer                     
              stabilization life than the materials which now exist.                         
              These materials will not require packing in wet and dry ice                    
              that is now necessary to implement their use in the science                    
              classroom.  In addition, the cost for shipping will be                         
              greatly reduced.                                                               
                                                                                             
              Both the stability and cost factors are significant barriers                   
              to the inclusion of biotechnology experiments in the                           
              classroom.  Dr. Nardone has worked with both teachers and                      
              scientists and so knows the problems inherent in this                          
              experimentation.
