Abstract    :
              Currently, hazardous waste is staged for retrograde outdoors at the            
              hazardous waste storage yard at McMurdo Station.  At this storage              
              yard the materials are exposed to the elements of cold, wind blown             
              snow and surface water runoff.  Further, spill containment and                 
              security are minimal to non-existent.  A modern hazardous waste                
              storage facility/building would improve the handling and managing              
              of hazardous waste.  The Army Corps of Engineers will design a                 
              hazardous waste storage facility/building which will be an                     
              improvement over the current situation.  The Army Corps of                     
              Engineers will use design criteria and past experience to see that             
              the facility/building will be properly designed and constructed.
