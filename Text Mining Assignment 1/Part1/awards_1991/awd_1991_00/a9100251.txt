Abstract    :
                   In this project the principal investigator will work on                   
              establishing the multisummability of formal power series that are              
              the solutions of algebraic differential equations.  The notion of              
              multisummability is a generalization of the concept of Borel                   
              summability.  Recently W. Balser gave a simple characterization                
              of multisummability of formal power series.  The principal                     
              investigator will employ these ideas of Balser along with the                  
              asymptotic calculus of Gevrey to study the structure of solutions              
              of nonlinear algebraic differential equations.                                 
                   The study of the properties of solutions of systems of                    
              algebraic differential equations is of interest for its own sake               
              and for the light it sheds on a number of problems in algebra and              
              analysis.  Around the turn of the century mathematicians like                  
              Poincare and Painleve were able to provide formal series                       
              solutions to several broad classes of differential equations.                  
              This work led in turn to advances in asymptotic calculus, since                
              it showed that very often divergent series solutions are as good               
              as or better than convergent series solutions.  In this project                
              the principal investigator will apply some of the latest results               
              on divergent series to study the solutions of nonlinear algebraic              
              differential equations.
