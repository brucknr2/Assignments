Abstract    :
                      Successful completion of the proposed research will result             
              in a greater understanding of the roles of inbreeding and genetic              
              drift in reducing genetic variation and fitness in both captive                
              and wild populations of the endangered nene (Branta                            
              sandvicensis).  Important information should also be obtained                  
              concerning the relative abilities of two different molecular                   
              techniques (DNA fingerprinting and haploid mitochondrial DNA                   
              sequencing) to assess inbreeding, genetic variation and their                  
              possible fitness consequences in these same populations.  Because              
              demographic and historic data are also available for these                     
              populations the genetic data can be used to test models of                     
              population genetic theory.  Lastly, the genetic and demographic                
              data should provide valuable input to the design of future                     
              captive breeding programs as well as to management of individuals              
              reintroduced to the diminishing wild population.
