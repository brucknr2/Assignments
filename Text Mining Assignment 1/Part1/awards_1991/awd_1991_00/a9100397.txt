Abstract    :
                   Small populations of endangered species risk extinction due               
              to random changes in population size, or due to harmful genetic                
              changes.  This research examines the relative importance of these              
              two factors for species survival.  The investigators will study                
              this question using wild populations of two rare plants species                
              in western Montana.  Results will contribute to general                        
              understanding of changes in population size, as well as allow                  
              managers to formulate guidelines and principles for preservation               
              of these and similar species.                                                  
                   Finally, Lesquerella humilis, one of the species to be                    
              studied, is an alternative crop species with potential economic                
              value in industry and medicine.  Unique hydroxylated oils from                 
              Lesquerella have several uses in manufacturing.  Sulfur compounds              
              (glucosinolates) from Lesquerella are being examined as a                      
              potential antitumor drug.  Thus, this research has important                   
              relevance to basic understanding of conservation biology as well               
              as potential for practical application.
