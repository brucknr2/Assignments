Abstract    :
                   A summer program for undergraduates will be held at the                   
              State University of New York-Stony Brook.  The students will                   
              work on the various research programs now underway in the                      
              Physics Department, and will meet as a group to discuss their                  
              experience and progress.  NSF support is highly recommended.
