Abstract    :
                   This project will support investigation of three problems                 
              concerning elliptic partial differential equations.  The first                 
              problem is to obtain sharp estimates and exact expressions for                 
              eigenvalues and bifurcation points.  The second problem is to                  
              establish existence theorems for smooth hypersurfaces with                     
              prescribed mean curvature in general Riemann spaces, and the                   
              third problem is to establish existence theorems for                           
              hypersurfaces with prescribed elementary symmetric function of                 
              the principal normal curvatures.                                               
                   These problems come from questions in Continuum Mechanics                 
              and Differential Geometry.  Results from this project have                     
              potential applications in areas such as the development of new                 
              materials and the computation of stresses in static structures.
