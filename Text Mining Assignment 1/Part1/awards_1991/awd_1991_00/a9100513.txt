Abstract    :
                   Current sheets provide an important physical mechanism for                
              heating of the solar corona as well as more violent phenomena                  
              such as flares.  Earlier work has demonstrated that the presence               
              of a small but finite resistivity has an important influence on                
              the formation of current sheets.  This research is to be                       
              continued through in depth studies of the following topics:  (i)               
              Current sheet formation by "free" and "force" reconnection, (ii)               
              role of helicity conservation, (iii) effect of current sheets on               
              coronal heating by Alfven waves and (iv) effect of resistivity on              
              complex topologies.  These topics will be studies through both                 
              analytical and numerical means.
