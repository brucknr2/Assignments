Abstract    :
                   This project will support 5 students to work on a                         
              project in Expert Systems Technology during the Summer of                      
              1991 as well as during the academic year at New Mexico                         
              Highlands University.  The students will take a course in                      
              expert systems technology in the Summer.  During the                           
              following academic year they will work with the principal                      
              investigator and faculty from the Chemistry and Anthropology                   
              departments to develop an expert system for identification of                  
              characteristics of skeletal remains.
