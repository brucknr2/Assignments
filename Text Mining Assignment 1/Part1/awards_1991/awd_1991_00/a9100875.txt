Abstract    :
              This program is in the Mechanical Engineering Department at Tuskegee           
              University.  Twelve minority engineering students at the end of their          
              junior year are recruited to have the research experience.  The duration       
              of the research activity for each student is expected to be one academic       
              year (one summer and two semesters).  Each undergraduate is paired with        
              a graduate student in an on-going funded research program under the            
              leadership of six faculty mentors.  The funded research areas are in           
              composite materials, fatigue, fracture mechanics, robotics, electric           
              propulsion and hypersonic flow.  Students participating in this program        
              are required to register for a three-credit hour Research course which         
              is used as a technical elective.  A technical report and an oral               
              presentation of the research work are required.  Biweekly meetings             
              during the regular semesters and weekly meetings during the summer             
              provide the forum for progress reports and exchange of information.
