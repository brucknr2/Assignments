Abstract    :
              This is a travel award for exploratory visits to two institutions              
              and to attend a professional meeting to visit faculty and examine              
              facilities.  These visits are to identify the best match of                    
              interests and appropriateness of library holdings in preparation               
              for a postdoctoral study program.  Initial contacts have been                  
              made with faculty at both of the scheduled institutions, who have              
              expressed an interest in serving as postdoctoral mentor.  This                 
              travel award will enable the investigator to meet with other                   
              members of the various appropriate departments and make a choice               
              of the program best suited to her goals.  Her presence at the                  
              professional meeting will allow her to interact with researchers               
              from other institutions as well as to interact with members of                 
              the Sociologists for Women in Society.  Initial discussions of                 
              possible arrangements for a postdoctoral appointment will also be              
              held.
