Abstract    :
              The program for undergraduate laboratory research experience at Cornell        
              University is based on the fact that Cornell's School of Civil and             
              Environmental Engineering has a strong experimental research program           
              using modern lab facilities in all principal subareas of civil and             
              environmental engineering.  The program is designed to generate hands-         
              on-lab research experiments performed with faculty in the following            
              laboratories, based on the students' interests, backgrounds, and               
              talents:  Concrete and Construction Materials, Environmental                   
              Engineering, Geotechnical, Hydraulics, Remote Sensing, and Structural          
              Engineering.  The program is building on a successful REU program in           
              civil and environmental engineering held at Cornell the past two               
              summers.  Each laboratory program has a faculty member as co-principal         
              investigator in charge.  A carefully thought-out evaluation, feedback          
              and interaction mechanism has been designed to assure that the                 
              undergraduate lab research experience is an enticement for talented            
              students to think seriously about advanced studies in engineering.             
              Cornell's minority recruitment, and advising and counseling program            
              assures that the interested minority students can be identified and            
              recruited.
