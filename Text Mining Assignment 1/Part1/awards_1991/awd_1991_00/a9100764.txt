Abstract    :
                   Lake Victoria, the second largest lake in the world, is also              
              one of the most speciose, with hundreds of native cichlid fishes               
              that evolved in the Lake and are found nowhere else.  The Lake is              
              currently undergoing a mass extinction of these fishes, one of                 
              the most extreme disruptions ever observed in so large a body of               
              water.                                                                         
                   In 1989, a Lake Victoria Research Team, consisting of US and              
              African scientists, was established to study the Lake and                      
              provide recommendations to ameliorate the situation.  This award               
              will fund a workshop so that the Team members, along with other                
              scientists, can determine what we already know about Lake                      
              Victoria, examine the dynamics of change in the Lake, and begin                
              to craft an action plan for conserving the Lake Victoria Basin.                
              Central to these discussions will be concern about the                         
              biodiversity and ecosystem dynamics of the lake, fisheries and                 
              watershed management, and lake basin development.
