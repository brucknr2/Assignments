Abstract    :
              The research on this new grant will focus on transverse phenomena              
              in ensembles of multistate fermion systems.  One theoretical                   
              objective is to bridge the gap between the new, actively developing            
              field of spin-polarized quantum systems and conventional theories              
              of low temperature systems of particles with internal degrees of               
              freedom.  Another objective is to develop a general theory of                  
              transverse (off-diagonal in internal states) phenomena in systems              
              of multistate fermions.  The Fermi liquid theory fails to describe             
              this class of effects and needs, at the minimum, to be modified.               
              There will be strong interactions with various experimental groups             
              in order to apply the developed theories to ultralow-temperature               
              thermometry, boundary effects and new quantum coherent effects in              
              ultra-cold atomic ensembles and beams, and some quasi-particle                 
              systems in solids.                                                             
              %%%                                                                            
              Fermi liquid theory has been the standard model for many years of              
              the collective properties of interacting fermions at low                       
              temperatures.  However, recent work on spin-polarized systems at               
              ultra-low temperatures has indicated that the Fermi liquid model is            
              deficient at these extreme conditions.  This research will modify              
              the Fermi liquid model, or develop new models as necessary, to deal            
              with these new phenomena.
