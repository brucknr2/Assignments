Abstract    :
              This award provides funds to the Biology department of Temple                  
              University to support a Research Experiences for Undergraduates                
              site for a combined academic year and summer program.  This                    
              program will draw on Temple's extensive experience with                        
              undergraduate research as part of the academic year research                   
              program, and also incorporate elements of the Temple University                
              Basic Science Summer Minority Program which has been in effect                 
              for the past two years.  The goal of this program is to provide a              
              rich research environment and a sense of community among                       
              promising students in order to encourage them to enter careers in              
              the biological sciences.                                                       
                                                                                             
              To achieve this goal, the program will have two major components.              
              The first of these is continued academic year participation in                 
              research projects by students enrolled at Temple.  The second is               
              an intensive Summer research program in which at least 40% of the              
              participates will be from outside Temple.  Academic year students              
              will have the opportunity to participate in the Summer program.                
              In both components special effort will be made to attract under-               
              represented minority students.                                                 
                                                                                             
              The program will focus on a multifaceted approach to the subject               
              of Light in Biological Systems, employing approaches from                      
              Biochemistry, Physiology, Genetics and Plant Science.
