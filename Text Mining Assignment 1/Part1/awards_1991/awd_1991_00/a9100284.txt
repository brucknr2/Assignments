Abstract    :
              With this grant in the Computational and Theoretical Chemistry                 
              program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Goddard will                      
              investigate the mechanisms of industrially significant                         
              catalytic processes (both heterogeneous and homogeneous). An                   
              understanding of these mechanisms will  provide the basis for                  
              the  design of new and more efficient catalysts.                               
                                                                                             
              The systems to be studied include: 1) Oxidation of butane to                   
              maleic anhydride by VPO catalysts, 2) Conversion of methanol to                
              gasoline as catalyzed by zeolites, 3) Activation of CH and CC                  
              bonds by transition metal complexes, and 4) Polymerization of                  
              olefins by Ziegler-Natta type catalysts. Professor Goddard will                
              extend the current methodology by incorporating the                            
              pseudospectral method of Freisner within his generalized                       
              valence bond programs (PS-GVB). This will allow PS-GVB studies                 
              on very large systems including a substantial amount of                        
              electronic correlation. In addition Professor Goddard  will be                 
              able to calculate GVB wave functions for infinite systems,                     
              allowing direct calculations of bulk and surface properties                    
              instead of using cluster models.
