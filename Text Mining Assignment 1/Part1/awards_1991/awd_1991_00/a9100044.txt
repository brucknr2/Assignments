Abstract    :
              The first part of the proposal continues a current project: first,             
              NMR will be used to measure spin transport in a dilute 3He-4He                 
              solution, using a spin-wave technique, in order to test a new                  
              theory for polarized quantum gases.  In a second experiment, one               
              will use a vibrating-wire viscometer to directly measure the                   
              effects of polarization upon momentum transport.  In addition,                 
              attempts will be made to create nuclear magnetic solitons, and to              
              detect hypothesized spin fluctuations in pure 3He liquid using an              
              NMR spin-diffusion technique.                                                  
                                                                                             
              The second part of the proposal deals with effects in a quantum                
              liquid confined at low temperature in a random porous material.                
              First, one will use a 3He-4He solution to probe random geometries              
              over much longer length scales than is possible at room                        
              temperature.  Secondly, a search will be made for effects analogous            
              to those seen in disordered electronic systems -- conductance                  
              fluctuations and weak and strong localization resulting from                   
              quantum or spin-wave interference within the random pore space.
