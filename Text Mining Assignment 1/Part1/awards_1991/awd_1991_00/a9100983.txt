Abstract    :
                   This award supports the research of Professor D. Jaffe to work            
              in algebraic geometry.  He will work on curves and surfaces in                 
              complex projective three-space.  In particular, he will work on the            
              conjecture that a smooth connected curve, whose degree exceeds its             
              genus by at least four, is not an intersection of two surfaces.                
                   This research is in the field of algebraic geometry, one of               
              the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which blossomed to             
              the point where it has, in the past 10 years, solved problems that             
              have stood for centuries.  Originally, it treated figures defined              
              in the plane by the simplest of equations, namely polynomials.                 
              Today, the field uses methods not only from algebra, but also from             
              analysis and topology, and conversely it is extensively used in                
              those fields.  Moreover, it has proved itself useful in fields as              
              diverse as physics, theoretical computer science, cryptography,                
              coding theory and robotics.
