Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A eight week program of mathematical research involving eight                  
              undergraduate students working with nine faculty members will be               
                                                                                             
              supported by this Research Experiences for Undergraduates award.               
                                                                                             
              The work will center on problems of matrix theory and discrete                 
              structures.  Participants will attack a progressive series of                  
              problems of increasing difficulty and generality.  Several will                
              benefit from exploration using sophisticated mathematical                      
              software packages for symbolic and matrix calculations.                        
                                                                                             
              Typical problem areas include studies of isometries of G-                      
              invariant matrix norms, computer generation of generalized                     
              numerical ranges, unitary factors in polar decomposition and                   
              robust Lyapunov matrices.                                                      
                                                                                             
              Students will also visit research facilities at NASA (Langley                  
              Research Center), ICASE, VIMS, CEBAF and NIST where faculty                    
              advisors have established working relationships. Reports will be               
                                                                                             
              completed by each student at the end of the program.  Students                 
              will be encouraged to present results of their work at                         
              professional meetings during the following academic year.
