              The U.S.-Japan Panel on Wind and Seismic                                       
              Effects was created in 1968.  Annual meetings                                  
              alternate between Japan and the U.S.  (odd                                     
              numbered years in Japan; even numbered years                                   
              in the U.S.).  The Panel develops                                              
              technologies that advance engineering design                                   
              and construction practices for an improved                                     
              quality-of-life.  The Panel is composed on 17                                  
              Federal agencies who participate in ten task                                   
              committees.  The task committees focus on                                      
              specific national issues, e.g., earthquake                                     
              hazards reduction, buried pipelines,                                           
              transportation and telecommunication systems,                                  
              repair and retrofit of structures.  The                                        
              results of the task committee workshops and                                    
              conferences are shared at the annual joint                                     
              meeting and usually published as proceedings.
