Abstract    :
                   The Physics Department at Rensselaer Polytechnic                          
              Institute will carry out an Undergraduate Research                             
              Participation Program for ten weeks in the Summer of 1991 with                 
              a follow-up during the 91/92 academic year.  Ten                               
              undergraduates will participate with at most four from                         
              Rensselaer and six from other, primarily undergraduate and                     
              women, institutions in the Northeast.  Candidates will be                      
              sought from all fields of science and engineering and they                     
              will have completed their junior year, although a few                          
              sophomores may be admitted under special circumstances.                        
                   Regularly scheduled seminars and social functions during                  
              the summer will provide contact between the participants, as                   
              well as faculty.  In addition, the research groups hold weekly                 
              meetings, which discuss technical issues of the experiments or                 
              modeling studies.
