Abstract    :
                   Often models fitted to data must obey certain constraints                 
              such as monotonicity or monotonicity for individual segments.                  
              This research concentrates on statistical modelling when the                   
              constraints can be described as either unimodality, piecewise                  
              monotonicity, or N-convexity.  Fitted functions will come from                 
              classes of functions defined by convex cones, unions of several                
              convex cones or intersections of a cone with a linear variety.                 
              Computational algorithms will be written, statistical aspects of               
              these procedures will be examined and hypothesis tests will be                 
              developed.
