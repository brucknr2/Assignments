Abstract    :
              The Gordon Research Conferences are held every summer to discuss               
              the recent findings and current thinking in various areas of                   
              science.  Although participation is limited, the attendees usually             
              consist of established scientists, young investigators who are                 
              making important contributions in these areas and postdoctoral                 
              fellows.  They are held in small, isolated New England towns away              
              from other distractions and conducive to the exchange of ideas.                
              These conferences have a recognized value for presenting the latest            
              advances in research and also indicating the future trends which               
              are likely to be most productive.
