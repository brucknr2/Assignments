Abstract    :
                   The two investigators will continue their studies in aspects              
              of Brownian motion.  Topics will include Brownian motion and the               
              boundary behavior of harmonic functions, reflecting Brownian                   
              motion with variable angle of reflections, the Brownian convex                 
              hull, behavior of Brownian paths on the boundary of a domain, the              
              non-Markovian side of Brownian motions, and Brownian motion on                 
              fractals.  An additional topic of self-avoiding random walk will               
              be studied.                                                                    
                   The two investigators will continue their studies in aspects              
              of Brownian motion.  Brownian motion is a specific stochastic                  
              process which is studied in probability theory.  This study will               
              impact areas of mathematics outside probability, namely potential              
              theory and mathematical physics.
