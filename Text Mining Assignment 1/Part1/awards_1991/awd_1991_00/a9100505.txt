Abstract    :
                   Measurements of fine-structure intervals will be carried out              
              in helium-like ions Ag45+ Gd62+ and Au77+, using accelerator                   
              produced ion beams at GANIL (France) and GSI (Germany), where                  
              high density beams are available.  The separations are determined              
              by a novel technique from measurements of the hyperfine -                      
              quenched lifetime of the 23P0 states in isotopes with nuclear                  
              spin I0.  It is also planned to measure the 23P0-23S1 intervals               
              in helium-like Xe52+ and U90+.  These measurements will provide                
              precise tests of theories of the two-electron atom at high-Z                   
              where relativistic effects and quantum electrodynamic effects are              
              very large.
