Abstract    :
                   Professor Wolf will continue his research on Lie groups,                  
              harmonic analysis, and representation theory, with some                        
              applications to complex analysis, Riemannian geometry, and control             
              theory.  He will develop applications of his recent results on the             
              equivalence of various methods of construction of representations.             
              He will study the possibility of determining the character of a                
              representation from a formula he has derived with R. Herb.  He will            
              complete his work on the Schwartz space of a general semisimple Lie            
              group and study discrete series representations of groups of                   
              hermitian type.  Finally, Professor Wolf will study the                        
              observability and controllability problems for evolution equations             
              associated to invariant differential operators on Riemannian                   
              homogeneous spaces.                                                            
                   Group theory is basically the theory of symmetry.  To take a              
              simple example, when the system in question is invariant under a               
              change in the position of the origin of space, the group of                    
              translations naturally arises.  While groups are abstract objects,             
              particular situations demand concrete realizations or                          
              "representations" of the symmetry group.
