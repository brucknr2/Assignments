Abstract    :
              Professor Alfred A. Scala and other members of the Chemistry                   
              Department of Worcester Polytechnic Institute are being                        
              supported to establish a Research Experiences for                              
              Undergraduates (REU) site in Chemistry.  For the period                        
              1991-92, nine undergraduate students will spend eight weeks                    
              each summer actively engaged in a variety of research projects.                
              The focus of the research projects will be photochemistry and                  
              spectroscopy, but these techniques will be used in a variety of                
              areas including catalysis, biochemistry, dynamics, molecular                   
              modeling, organic synthesis, and polymer chemistry.  Students                  
              will present their results in informal and formal seminars                     
              during the program.
