Abstract    :
                   A physics research program for nine undergraduate                         
              students is planned at UC Irvine each summer for the next                      
              three years.  The program involves projects with a variety of                  
              physics research groups under close faculty supervision.                       
              Close contact between the student participants is promoted                     
              through shared housing, a special seminar series, excursions                   
              to other research labs in the Los Angeles area, and social                     
              activities.                                                                    
                   The program is administrated by a senior Ph.D. research                   
              physicist/teacher experienced in involving undergraduates in                   
              research.  With the assistance of the project PI, this                         
              administrator arranges publicity, recruitment, orientation,                    
              seminars, excursions, a post-summer follow-up program, and                     
              generally works to insure a valuable research experience for                   
              students in the program.
