Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research, carried out by one of the worlds leading                        
              observational astronomers, is aimed at increasing our detailed                 
              knowledge of the more distant parts of the universe.  It consists              
              of four parts.  The first is a survey of very distant clusters of              
              galaxies, utilizing a powerful instrument developed by the                     
              principal investigator, to obtain a statistically complete sample              
              of clusters with redshifts between 0.5 and 1.  The second is a                 
              study of active galaxies in distant clusters.  These objects appear            
              to become more common as we look at greater distances.  The object             
              of this part of the research is to investigate the incidence of                
              these objects at greater distances.  It is hoped that this will                
              extend our set of objects with measured redshifts out to a                     
              development of the software package utilized to reduce and analyze             
              the data obtained in the other parts of this study.
