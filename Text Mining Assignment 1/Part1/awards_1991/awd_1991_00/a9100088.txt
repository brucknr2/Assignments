Abstract    :
                   The NAS sponsored Committee on Atomic, Molecular and Optical              
              Sciences (CAMOS) will select and oversee a panel of scientists                 
              which will carry out an assessment of future opportunities in                  
              atomic, molecular and optical physics.  The panel will report on               
              scientific and technological opportunities, identifying and                    
              recommending areas in which investments of resources should be                 
              concentrated, and, as well, those of diminishing relative                      
              interest and promise.  It will address manpower, instrumentation,              
              facility, and funding issues, not only in the context of                       
              intellectual challenges, but also in the context of identified                 
              national needs such as science education; defense, energy and                  
              environmental applications; industrial and technological                       
              competitiveness, and appropriate aspects of human health and                   
              welfare.  Findings will be presented in a report which meets the               
              standards of the NAS, and which will be published by the National              
              Academy Press.
