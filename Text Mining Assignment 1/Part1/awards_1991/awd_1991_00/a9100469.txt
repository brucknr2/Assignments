Abstract    :
                   This project is concerned with integral representation                    
              theory.  The principal investigator will focus on the application              
              of pullbacks to orders.  He will examine group rings for finite                
              groups with cyclic p-Sylow subgroups over the p-adic completion                
              of the integers.  He will also study arbitrary finitely generated              
              modules over certain types of orders.                                          
                   A ring is an algebraic object having an addition and                      
              multiplication defined on it.  The most familiar example is the                
              ring of integers.  These objects occur in many different settings              
              in mathematics and theoretical physics.  This particular project               
              is concerned with group rings and is of interest both in ring                  
              theory and in group theory.
