Abstract    :
                   The mathematical theory of weak convergence has been shown                
              to have important applications to problems arising in continuum                
              physics because it describes the relations between microscopic                 
              variables and their averages at a macroscopic level.  In order to              
              average nonlinear quantities, a mathematical tool called                       
              compensated compactness has been developed by F. Murat and the                 
              principal investigator and it has been used to obtain various                  
              relations of a macroscopic nature from corresponding microscopic               
              relations.  An improvement of this tool, based on so called H-                 
              measures that first appeared in questions of homogenization, has               
              been developed recently by the principal investigator.                         
                   The goal of this project is to further study the                          
              mathematical properties of H-measures, enlarge the class of its                
              applications to nonlinear partial differential equations of                    
              continuum mechanics, and define more general mathematical objects              
              that could remedy some of the already known limitations of H-                  
              measures.                                                                      
                   Particular areas to be studied include effective properties               
              of mixtures, nonlocal effects induced by homogenization,                       
              evolution of microstructures in composite materials and damping                
              of waves in heterogeneous materials.
