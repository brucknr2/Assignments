Abstract    :
              A multiplexed holographic Fabry-Perot (MHFP)                                   
              etalon technology which incorporates a multiplexed                             
              hologram into a novel holographic Fabry-Perot (HFP)                            
              etalon is being investigated by Physical Optics                                
              Corporation (POC).  Two unique advantages of the                               
              MHFP etalon technology are:  (i) coherently-coupled                            
              fabrication of HFP mirrors significantly reduces the                           
              need to have nearly flat surfaces typical in                                   
              conventional Fabry-Perot (FP) etalons (and thus,                               
              results in an inexpensive, large aperture FP etalon)                           
              and (ii) the angular/wavelength multiplexing                                   
              capability of a multiplexed hologram can be combined                           
              with the uniqueness of FP etalons (such as narrow-                             
              band operation and tunability).  The primary                                   
              objective in Phase II will be the continued                                    
              development of both HFP and MHFP devices and                                   
              applications not achievable by conventional FP                                 
              etalons.  Specifically, Phase II will concentrate on                           
              optimizing the performance of HFP etalons,                                     
              advancing the fabrication technology HFP etalons,                              
              developing tunable HFP technology in solid and air-                            
              spaced etalon configurations, studying the                                     
              enhancement of diffraction efficiency in MHFP                                  
              etalons, and developing a tunable MHFP etalon                                  
              technology.  POC will also demonstrate prototypes                              
              for optical communications and processing                                      
              applications based on these novel technologies.
