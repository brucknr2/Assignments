Abstract    :
                   The Geology Departments of Bryn Mawr College, Bucknell                    
              University, Lafayette College, and Lehigh University propose to                
              form a consortium that fosters undergraduate geologic research in              
              Pennsylvania.  Important research opportunities in subjects as                 
              diverse as tectonics and hydrogeology are available in                         
              Pennsylvania for students from these and other high-quality                    
              institutions.  The program will foster cross-institutional and                 
              cross-disciplinary studies as students work closely with one or                
              more faculty mentors.  Not only will the program provide research              
              experience and career guidance to undergraduate geology majors,                
              but we also expect that significant advances in our understanding              
              of Pennsylvania geology will result from the coordinated                       
              undergraduate research activities.
