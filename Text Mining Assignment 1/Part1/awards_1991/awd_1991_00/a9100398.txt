Abstract    :
              This award provides an additional three years of continuing                    
              support to the Department of Biology at Hope College to carry on               
              with the Research Experience for Undergraduates Site that was                  
              established in 1988. The program will provide ten undergraduate                
              students with an in-depth summer experience in research in                     
              environmental biology.  In order to provide research                           
              opportunities to individuals who are not well represented in                   
              science, the department will recruit women and members of                      
              minority groups to participate in the program with the goal of                 
              having at least 50% of the student participants being women and                
              50% being members of minority groups.  Five students from Hope                 
              College and five students from other schools will be selected for              
              participation on the basis of academic record, research ability                
              and potential, initiative, independence and professional                       
              objectives.  Students will select a research project from five                 
              different areas related to environmental biology:  1) Molecular                
              Biology of Nitrogen Fixation, 2) Environmental Biochemistry and                
              Physiology, 3) Genetic Toxicology, 4) Plant and Animal                         
              Parasitology and 5) Ecology and Systematics and will work under                
              the supervision of twelve Ph.D faculty members.  Students will                 
              perform independent research projects, give oral presentations on              
              their work in progress, attend workshops on graduate school and                
              scientific writing, attend special scientific seminars and                     
              prepare a research poster and research paper summarizing their                 
              work.
