Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Numerical and theoretical studies of pattern formation in a variety            
              of nonlinear, nonequilibrium dynamical systems will be studied.                
              These studies include the kinetics of phase separation in binary               
              alloys, polymer blends and block copolymers.  Additional topics                
              include Rayleigh Benard convection in pure fluids and reaction-                
              diffusion phenomena in chemical and biological systems.  These                 
              studies involve application and improvement of algorithms developed            
              in prior work.  As such, algorithm development for massively                   
              parallel computers is included to facilitate the solution of some              
              of these problems.  The grant is funded through the Materials                  
              Theory program in the Division of Materials Research and the New               
              Technologies program in the Division of Advanced Scientific
