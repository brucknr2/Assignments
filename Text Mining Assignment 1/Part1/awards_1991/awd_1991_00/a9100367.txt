Abstract    :
                   Professor Knapp will make systematic use of intertwining                  
              operators into and out of reducible and irreducible representations            
              of semisimple Lie groups in order to understand the representations            
              better.  Two specific areas of investigation are the relationship              
              of algebraic and analytic forms of representations and the                     
              introduction of a more direct approach to harmonic analysis on                 
              semisimple symmetric spaces.  The postdoctoral associate supported             
              by this award will use micro-local analysis to gain a better                   
              understanding of the dual of a semisimple Lie group.                           
                   The research supported by this award is in the area of the                
              representation theory of groups.  Groups usually arise as                      
              transformations which preserve the structure of some system.  For              
              example, the group of rotations about the center preserves the                 
              sphere.  In applications the abstract group is not all that is                 
              needed but in addition a concrete realization of this group, called            
              a representation.  This project will study the representations                 
              which arise from a family of smooth groups called Lie groups.
