Abstract    :
              This award is made in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and                          
              Organometallic Chemistry Program to Clemson University to                      
              support the research of Dr. Gregory Robinson. Dr. Robinson's                   
              research deals with the design, synthesis, structure and                       
              reactivity of organoaluminum:amine complexes and provides                      
              needed structural data on coordination of main group elements.                 
              The interactions of organoaluminum moieties with macrocyclic                   
              amines, multidentate open-chain amines and nitrogen                            
              heterocycles will be investigated. Preliminary results indicate                
              that these systems contain aluminum centers in unusual trigonal                
              bipyramidal, square pyramidal and octahedral coordination                      
              environments.  The coordination of the aluminum atom(s) will be                
              determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction and aluminum-27                 
              NMR.  The thermal behavior of these unusual compounds and their                
              feasibility to function as single-source molecular precursors                  
              for ceramic materials will be investigated.                                    
              %%%                                                                            
              Organoaluminum chemistry is an important but rather neglected                  
              area of organometallic chemistry. In addition to filling in                    
              serious gaps in our knowledge of aluminum chemistry, the                       
              project will result in the synthesis of new organoaluminum                     
              compounds which will be of potential value as precursors for                   
              the preparation of ceramic materials such as aluminum nitride.
