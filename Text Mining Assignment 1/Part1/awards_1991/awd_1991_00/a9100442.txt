Abstract    :
                   This award provides funds for the support of two                          
              undergraduates working with the principal investigator on                      
              mathematical problems arising in the modeling of transport of                  
              medical drugs within brain tissue.  The models will be designed                
              to explain the types of transport (convection, diffusion or                    
              absorption) by which a drug may spread from an injection site                  
              into the brain.  Students will concentrate on developing the                   
              appropriate mathematical analysis necessary to formulate the                   
              model through their studies of systems of nonlinear equations,                 
              regularity of solutions of the heat equation and the application               
              of multivariate analysis to regression.  Work will also be done                
              on the design of experimental computational schemes for testing                
              various models                                                                 
                   Although the students will use data derived from live                     
              experiments, their work consists solely of mathematical modeling               
              and mathematical analysis.
