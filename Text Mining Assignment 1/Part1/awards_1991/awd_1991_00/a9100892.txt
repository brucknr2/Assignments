Abstract    :
                   A Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site will be              
              carried out in the Physics Department of The Pennsylvania State                
              University at the University Park campus during 1991-                          
              1993.  The REU site will involve 14 students in research                       
              projects each summer, 10 funded by NSF and 4 by Penn State.                    
              Students will be involved in a wide range of frontier research                 
              projects, consistent with the department's excellent record of                 
              undergraduate research in all areas of physics.                                
                   As an REU site, the Penn State Physics Department will mount              
              an aggressive campaign to recruit students into the                            
              program, with a wide recruitment area covering Pennsylvania and                
              surrounding, mid-Atlantic region states.  Efforts to                           
              encourage minority student enrollment include a special                        
              recruitment agreement with the Physics Department at                           
              Morehouse College, Georgia and making use of contacts with other               
              predominantly minority universities and colleges in the region.                
                There will be special seminars and background courses for                    
              participating students in order to broaden and reinforce their                 
              knowledge of physics and to encourage interaction with                         
              faculty.  Valuable skills, such as machine shop use and                        
              scientific computing, will also be taught.  Extra-curricular                   
              activities will be organized to encourage students to interact                 
              informally with faculty and graduate students.  Throughout the                 
              program emphasis will be placed on encouraging students'                       
              interest in careers in physics.
