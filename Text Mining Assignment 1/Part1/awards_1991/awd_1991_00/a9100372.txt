Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal requsts partial support for postdoctoral fellows and             
              junior scientists to attend the XIth International Symposium on                
              Glycoconjugates to be held June 30-July 5, 1991 in Toronto, Canada.            
              The host organization for this meeting is the Society for Complex              
              Carbohydrates, the North American component of the international               
              organization.  Complex carbohydrates or glycoconjugates are widely             
              distributed in nature, mainly as glycoproteins or glycolipids.  The            
              presence of carbohydrates on proteins plays a role in protein                  
              stability and modulates protein function.  Glycoproteins and                   
              glycolipids on cell surfaces confer specificity to the cells and               
              play a crucial role in phenomena such as the selective binding of              
              hormones, growth factors and toxins, the immune response,                      
              fertilization, differentiation, and growth, and the social behavior            
              of cells.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              The past decade has witnessed an extraordinary burst of activity               
              in glycoconjugate research, particularly because of the possible               
              role of carbohydrates in growth and development, and in modulation             
              of the immune system.  The International Symposia on                           
              Glycoconjugates have, over the years, been the most important                  
              meetings for dissemination of information in this area of research.            
              It will be extremely important for postdoctoral fellows and junior             
              scientists to be able to attend and present their work at the                  
              forthcoming meeting.
