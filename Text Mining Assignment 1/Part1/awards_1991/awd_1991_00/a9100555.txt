Abstract    :
              This award provides funds to the Department of Environmental,                  
              Population and Organismic Biology at the University of Colorado                
              at Bolder to continue their Research Experience for                            
              Undergraduates SITE in ecology, behavior and evolution.  The                   
              program provides undergraduates contemplating a career in the                  
              biological sciences with 1) an introduction to current research                
              areas of soil ecology, plant and insect ecology and evolution,                 
              plant physiology and behavioral ecology; 2) the opportunity to                 
              conduct original research in a supportive, interactive                         
              environment; 3) instruction in the planning, execution, and                    
              interpretation of research in the areas of ecology, evolution and              
              behavior.  All participating students will attend a course that                
              will introduce them to the fields of ecology, evolution and                    
              behavior, aid in planning and executing an original research                   
              project, give them an introduction to statistical analysis, and                
              provide information on applying to graduate school.  They will                 
              also present the results of their research in a short seminar at               
              the end of the summer.  Students will work with faculty members                
              on their projects, and will also be able to interact with other                
              students and post-docs in their laboratories.
