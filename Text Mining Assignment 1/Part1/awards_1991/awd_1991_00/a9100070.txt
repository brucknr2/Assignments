Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator and his graduate students will                 
              develop and use asymptotic and numerical methods to study a                    
              number of problems in applied mathematics.  In particular, they                
              will study the scattering of sound waves by inhomogeneous                      
              structures, strong localized perturbations of eigenvalues,                     
              diffusion in bounded and unbounded shear flows, and the pairing                
              of eigenvalues of the Laplace operator in certain planar domains.              
                   Many natural phenomena are described by differential                      
              equations whose solutions are difficult to find using traditional              
              techniques of applied mathematics.  The principal investigator                 
              and his graduate students will apply asymptotic and numerical                  
              methods of nonstandard types in order to approximate accurately                
              the solutions of problems in diverse areas of applied mathematics              
              such as acoustic scattering and nonlinear diffusion.
