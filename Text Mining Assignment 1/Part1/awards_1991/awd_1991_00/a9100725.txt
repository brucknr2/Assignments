Abstract    :
                   The project will support research into a number of problems               
              in probability theory.  Liggett will consider several questions                
              related to interacting particle systems:  survival and extinction              
              of contact processes in random environments, rates of convergence              
              to equilibrium in the exclusion process, survival of the                       
              threshold voter model, and the limiting behavior of an infinite                
              series of queues.  Schonmann will consider problems in                         
              interacting particle systems and large deviations:  metastability              
              for stochastic Ising models, critical behavior of cellular                     
              automata, and large deviations for random fields.                              
                   The principal investigators will conduct research on several              
              problems in probability theory.  The primary focus will be on                  
              interacting systems of particles.  These systems arise in                      
              modeling physical and biological systems, and have applications                
              in other areas, such as computer science.
