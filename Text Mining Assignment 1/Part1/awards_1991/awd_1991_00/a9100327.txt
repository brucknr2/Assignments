Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will study equilibrium                         
              configurations, instabilities and waves in fluids and plasmas.                 
              In particular, he will focus attention on fluid structures known               
              as vortex rings with swirl and their plasma counterparts known as              
              plasma tori.  Such equilibrium configurations are derived from a               
              variational principle, and the principal investigator will employ              
              the venerable method of geometric optics to study the stability                
              properties of these equilibrium states.                                        
                   In order to study accurately the behavior of fluids within                
              the core of the earth one must appreciate the fact that under                  
              many sets of circumstances the fluids within the core act more                 
              like plasmas (ionized fluids) than ordinary gases and liquids.                 
              In this project the principal investigator will first make a                   
              comparative study of equilibrium structures and their stability                
              in both fluids and plasmas.  Then he will apply these results to               
              describe the long-term evolution of small-amplitude perturbations              
              to stable vortex rings and plasma tori of the type found in the                
              earth's core.
