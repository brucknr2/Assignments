Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a dissertation improvement grant.  The research studies                
              influences which originate in prayer groups, and extend to social              
              relationships outside the group.  Considerable theory in sociol-               
              ogy identifies consensual values as fundamental to society.                    
              Through observations and interviews, PIs will investigate the                  
              extent to which relationships established in Charismatic Catholic              
              ritual are replicated in participants' social relationships                    
              outside the church.  Investigators expect to find changes in                   
              external social relationship following conversion to the reli-                 
              gion,  and they will explore development of these relationships                
              over respondents' lives.  Results permit test of several hypothe-              
              ses relating religious forms to social forms, and the signif-                  
              icance of moral values in building social cohesion.
