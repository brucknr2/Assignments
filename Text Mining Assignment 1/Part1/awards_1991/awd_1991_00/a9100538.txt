Abstract    :
              Professor Margaret E. Kastner and other members of the                         
              Chemistry Department at Bucknell University are being supported                
              to conduct a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site                
              in Chemistry.  For the period 1991-93, eleven undergraduate                    
              students will spend ten weeks each summer actively engaged in a                
              variety of research projects.  Two of these students will also                 
              continue their research during the academic year.  Projects                    
              involve synthesis of organic compounds or metal complexes,                     
              structure determination by spectroscopic and crystallographic                  
              methods, liquid chromatography and mass spectroscopy studies,                  
              and enzyme purification and characterization.  Students will                   
              present their work at a poster session at the end of the                       
              program and will attend a lecture series by a distinguised                     
              invited scientist.
