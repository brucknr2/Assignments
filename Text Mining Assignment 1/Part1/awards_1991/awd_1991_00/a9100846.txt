Abstract    :
              This award provides support to continue a 10-week summer research              
              experience for nine undergraduates from Carleton College and                   
              other regional colleges and universities.  Pre-participation                   
              reading requirements will provide students with an adequate                    
              foundation for meaningful scientific investigation.  During the                
              summer, students will work in a one-to-one relationship with a                 
              research supervisor in the laboratory.  Weekly seminars will                   
              provide students with the opportunity to discuss research plans                
              and results as well as to delve into primary scientific articles.              
              To further focus and unify the student participants, a theme of                
              development regulation has been selected.  Projects will include               
              investigations of:  the mechanisms of action and the chemical                  
              characteristics of apossibly-steroid pheromone produced by                     
              Oedogonium, regulation of floral development in pea, structure-                
              function relationships in the repressor protein of bacteriophage               
              P1, structure and function of the glucocorticoid receptor in rat               
              liver, development of synaptic connections in Xenopus, variation               
              of sex expression in composites, role of song communication in                 
              coordination of parental care in cardinals, and effect of                      
              gregarine parasites on population biology of capitellid                        
              polychaetes.  Students will present their results during a fall                
              poster symposium.  Opportunities to complete research and writing              
              during winter break will be available.
