Abstract    :
              The nine week summer program at Clemson University is intended to              
              provide a group of eight outstanding undergraduate students with               
              perhaps the first opportunity to participate in highly                         
              individualized bioengineering research activities, in a typical                
              university environment under direct supervision by four faculty                
              members assisted by two experienced graduate students.  The                    
              participants are selected from among applicants solicited from                 
              about 50 institutions which are primarily undergraduate colleges               
              with 60-100% women and/or minority enrollment.  Most of these                  
              institutions have limited access to research.  Although the program            
              is geared to undergraduate engineering students who may consider               
              graduate training in bioengineering, exceptional students from                 
              other pertinent physical and biological science disciplines are                
              encouraged to enroll in the program, as future bioengineers.  The              
              program is designed to provide the students with a step-wise                   
              scenario of a mini-research project.  This will entail (a) having              
              basic topical instructions pertinent to bioengineering; (b) hands-             
              on exercise on literature search and outlining of plans for a                  
              research project; (c) exposure to general and specific laboratory              
              techniques used in bioengineering research; (d) observing and                  
              taking part in the planned research activities, recognizing                    
              important aspects of being a team-member among research                        
              experimentalists, and making on-the-spot decisions in the                      
              laboratory environment; and (e) recording, analyzing, and                      
              presenting technical data, as well as making  technical judgements             
              on results with supported conclusions.  In the classroom and                   
              laboratory, students will learn how to interact effectively with               
              classmates, experienced graduates students and graduate research               
              advisors at their respective levels.
