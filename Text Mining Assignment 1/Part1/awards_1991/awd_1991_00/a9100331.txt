Abstract    :
              This award will provide partial support for a research workshop                
              on Banach space theory to be held at the Universidad de los                    
              Andes (ULA) in Merida, Venezuela, January 6-17, 1992.  The U.S.                
              organizer is Bor-Luh Lin, of the University of Iowa; the                       
              Venezuelan organizer is Jorge B. Vielma, ULA.  The workshop's                  
              aim is to stimulate cooperative research and the exchange of                   
              ideas between senior and junior participants, as well as                       
              between U.S. and Venezuelan mathematicians.  It also would                     
              provide an opportunity for establishing future cooperation                     
              between institutions of the two countries.                                     
                                                                                             
              The workshop will focus on several important areas of Banach                   
              space research, such as the local theory and the study of                      
              geometrical properties of these spaces, the study of extreme                   
              structures of bounded closed convex sets (a focus of Banach                    
              space theory in the last 25 years), the existence of nice                      
              equivalent norms and minimal sets in Banach spaces, and other                  
              topics in which the geometry of Banach spaces has found many                   
              important applications.  Workshop participants will also discuss               
              applications of Banach space techniques to analytic functions,                 
              nonlinear analysis, partial differential equations, and fixed                  
              point theory.
