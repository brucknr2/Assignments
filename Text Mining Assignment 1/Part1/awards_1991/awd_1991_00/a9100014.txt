Abstract    :
                   The seminal work of A.A. Markoff in 1872 described the degree             
              of approximability of badly approximable real numbers in terms of              
              a sequence of quadratic forms and their homogeneous minima.  The               
              study of this - the first Markoff Chain - and of the corresponding             
              theory for other real numbers and forms has made considerable                  
              progress over the last twenty years.  One direction has been to                
              study the structure of the spectrum itself.  A second direction has            
              been to increase the understanding of the relevance of hyperbolic              
              geometry and the connection with the algebra of the free group on              
              two generators.  Much of the detailed technical calculations rely              
              on the cutting sequences of the geodesics which in turn are related            
              to the so-called two-distance sequences arising in the study of                
              quasi-crystals.                                                                
                   This grant will partially support a six day workshop on the               
              Markoff spectrum and higher dimensional approximation constants to             
              be held at Brigham Young University in May, 1991.  The workshop                
              will facilitate the exchange of information and will encourage the             
              research of about thirty mathematicians working in several related             
              areas of mathematics connected with Diophantine Approximation.                 
              Recent results in this area make such a workshop most timely.
