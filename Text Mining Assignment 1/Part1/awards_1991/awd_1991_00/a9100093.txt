Abstract    :
              Through this contract, the National Academy of Sciences                        
              (NAS) will continue its scientific exchange programs                           
              with the academies of sciences of the U.S.S.R., Bulgaria,                      
              Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Yugoslavia                       
              in Calendar Year 1991.  These programs support individual                      
              visits by postdoctoral scientists and engineers of the                         
              participating countries to scientific research facilities                      
              of the other countries for familiarization, lecturing,                         
              and research.  The programs also include special thrusts                       
              to encourage the participation of young participants and                       
              to promote short-term project development visits in                            
              support of the NSF's cooperative research programs with                        
              the countries of the region.                                                   
                                                                                             
              This activity promotes two important program objectives:                       
              advancing scientific knowledge by fostering professional                       
              contacts between American and foreign scientists, and                          
              supporting U.S. foreign-policy objectives by maintaining                       
              a framework of nongovernmental cooperation with the                            
              U.S.S.R. and the countries of Eastern Europe.  The                             
              interacademy exchange programs have had an excellent                           
              record over the years of obtaining access for U.S.                             
              scientist and engineers to scientific personnel and                            
              facilities of these countries in a framework of                                
              reciprocity and mutuality of benefit.
