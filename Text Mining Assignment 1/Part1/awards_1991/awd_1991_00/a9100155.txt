Abstract    :
              This award supports the integration of airborne gravity with                   
              the combined airborne radar and aeromagnetic Corridor                          
              Aerogeophysics of the Southeastern Ross Transect Zone                          
              (CASERTZ) program which will be conducted by the Byrd Polar                    
              Research Center and the USGS.  This program will survey two                    
              220 x 330 km regions between the Transantarctic Mountains                      
              and Marie Byrd Land during the 1990-1991 and 1991-1992 field                   
              seasons.  The survey will consist of a 5 x 5 km track                          
              spacing and is designed to determine the motion, volcanism                     
              and deformation history of the Ellsworth-Whitmore crustal                      
              block of West Antarctica and the relationship of the                           
              tectonics of this block to the evolution of the Byrd                           
              Subglacial Basin, the Interior Ross Embayment and the                          
              Transantarctic Mountains.  The airborne gravimetry will                        
              improve the capability of the CASERTZ program to define                        
              crustal structure and add a new capability to model crustal                    
              thickness.
