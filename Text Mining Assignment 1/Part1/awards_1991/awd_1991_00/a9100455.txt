Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will continue his studies of                   
              various problems in statistical mechanics.  In particular, he will             
              study the Heisenberg model for ferromagnetism, in order to show                
              that at low temperature the free energy of this model approximates             
              the free energy of a perfect Bose gas.  He will also work on models            
              of high density classical gases with short-range interaction and on            
              ground state energies of many-body Coulomb systems.  The basic aim             
              of statistical mechanics is to obtain the large scale thermodynamic            
              behavior of a many-particle system from a knowledge of the                     
              microscopic interactions between the particles.  The principal                 
              investigator will validate several approximate theories concerning             
              gases that have applicability to phenomena involving superfluidity             
              and superconductivity.
