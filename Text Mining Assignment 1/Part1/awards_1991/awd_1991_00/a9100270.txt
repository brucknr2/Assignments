Abstract    :
                   This project will support 6 students to attend an 8                       
              week summer research program followed by academic year                         
              research at the student's home institution.  The first 3                       
              weeks of the summer will include instruction in parallel                       
              languages, data structures for parallel programming, and                       
              exposure to parallel algorithms.  In the remaining 5 weeks                     
              students are separated into teams of two members each to do                    
              research on problems such as parallel combinatorial                            
              algorithms and parallel composite graph coloring.
