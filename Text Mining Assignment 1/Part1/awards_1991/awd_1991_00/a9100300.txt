Abstract    :
              Numerous examples illustrate how coextrusion of polymeric film with            
              three or more layers is economically used to achieve a desirable               
              mix of end-use characteristics.  The recent development of layer-              
              multiplying devices permits continuous processing of sheet or film             
              with hundreds or thousands of alternating layers of two or more                
              polymers and creates new opportunities for coextrusion technology.             
              Motivated by the need for new processing technologies for creating             
              engineered microstructures of incompatible polymers, a research                
              program will be developed to study the unique advantages that can              
              be achieved with this versatile process.  New phenomena are                    
              expected as the layer thickness is decreased from the macroscale               
              (tens of microns) to the microscale (several microns) and finally              
              to the nanoscale (tens of nanometers).  The complex behavior of                
              these composite systems will be analyzed in terms of interactive               
              hierarchical levels of structure with particular regard to effects             
              of layer thickness and adhesion between layers.  The potential for             
              enhanced mechanically properties is only one possibility; the                  
              feasibility of creating film and sheet materials with multiple                 
              functions, including unusual optical or electronic properties,                 
              seems possible.                                                                
                                                                                             
              This grant is jointly funded by the Divisions of Materials Research
