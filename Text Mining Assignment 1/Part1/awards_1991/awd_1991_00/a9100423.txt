Abstract    :
              The proposed work is part of an integrated research program into               
              the oceanographic structure of the western Weddell Sea.  It is to              
              be carried out from an ice camp jointly occupied by U.S. and USSR              
              scientists from February to June 1992.  The work proposed here is              
              an effort to define the vertical and horizontal thermohaline                   
              fluxes within the western part of the Weddell Gyre.                            
              Specifically, instrument clusters capable of measuring the                     
              Reynolds stress and the turbulent heat flux directly will be from              
              the ice at the camp and maintained throughout the duration of the              
              drift.  Also, a remote buoy to measure upper ocean temperature,                
              salinity and current structure will be emplaced to make                        
              observations in the larger scale variability within which the                  
              turbulence data is embedded, and which can be expected to have                 
              some effect on the turbulence intensity.  The measurements will                
              be used in conjunction with other concurrent experiments to                    
              quantify the energy brought to the underside of the ice and form               
              part of the flux of energy from the ocean through the sea ice                  
              cover to the atmosphere.
