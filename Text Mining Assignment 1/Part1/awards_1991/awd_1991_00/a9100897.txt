Abstract    :
              Professor Thomas E. Bitterwolf and other members of the                        
              Chemistry Department at the University of Idaho are being                      
              supported to conduct a Research Experiences for Undergraduates                 
              (REU) site in Chemistry.  For the period 1991-93, eight                        
              undergraduate students will spend eight weeks each summer                      
              actively engaged in a variety of research projects.  Example                   
              projects include photochemistry of dinuclear organometallic                    
              complexes at low temperatures, investigation of calcium channel                
              blockers, and characterization of polymer additives.  Students                 
              will prepare a full journal-style report on the results of                     
              their research.
