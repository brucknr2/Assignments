Abstract    :
                   This workshop addresses the development of the computer                   
              science curriculum by inviting leading researchers with a track                
              record in teaching and research to describe the content and                    
              structure of courses that have worked well in practice in                      
              specific areas such as the following: Introductory courses,                    
              Computer Literacy courses, Mathematics for Computer Science,                   
              Programming Languages, Programming Methodology, Architecture,                  
              Software Engineering, Computer Systems, Databases, Theory of                   
              Computation, Algorithms, and Artificial Intelligence. One of                   
              the goals of this workshop is to produce a source book and a                   
              critical review of some of the best courses and materials                      
              available for undergraduate computer science education.                        
                   It is widely recognized that the computer science                         
              curriculum needs to be reformed.  This workshop is significant                 
              because it covers a broad range of courses from well-respected                 
              institutions and it will actually produce a sourcebook.
