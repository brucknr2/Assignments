Abstract    :
                   The principal investigators will study problems in complex                
              differential geometry and spectral geometry. Professor Greene will             
              attempt to find biholomorphic invariants which can be used to                  
              classify domains with noncompact automorphism group. Professor                 
              Petersen will study the relationship between the topology and                  
              geometry of a manifold and the spectrum of the Laplace operator.               
              The post doctoral associate supported by this award, S. Zhu, will              
              study the relationship between topology and Ricci curvature.                   
                   This award will support work in differential geometry which               
              tries to relate global topological information to local analytic               
              information. The local information generally is presented in the               
              form of an invariant of a differential equation or system of                   
              equations. The information is then used to classify the domain or              
              to obtain restrictions on the global "shape" of the set under                  
              consideration.
