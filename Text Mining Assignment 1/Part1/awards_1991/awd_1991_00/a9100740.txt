Abstract    :
              This award provides funds to the department of biology at the                  
              University of New Mexico, Albuquerque to establish an REU Program              
              at the Sevilleta LTER site.  Ten undergraduates will participate               
              in long-term ecological research projects in central New Mexico.               
              As part of the NSF Long-Term Ecological Research Network, the                  
              Sevilleta LTER site provides students with a unique opportunity                
              to examine ecological processes at the boundaries of several                   
              major southwestern biomes (Chihuahuan Desert, Great Plains                     
              Grassland, Great Basin Shrub-Steppe, Interior Chaparral, Pinon-                
              Juniper Woodland and Sub-Alpine Forest).  Working in direct                    
              association with the 19 LTER faculty researchers, the REU                      
              students will become involved in a wide variety of ecology                     
              studies, including meteorology, botany, zoology, watershed                     
              dynamics, nutrient cycling, landscape ecology, GIS and data                    
              management/computer systems.  Students will participate in a                   
              seminar series, learn various field research techniques, design                
              and implement their own research project, orally report and                    
              publish their results, and travel to a national scientific                     
              meeting with the LTER faculty.  These activities will serve to                 
              integrate various aspects of the LTER Program, and facilitate a                
              holistic approach to ecosystem studies.
