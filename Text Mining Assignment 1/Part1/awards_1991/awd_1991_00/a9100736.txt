Abstract    :
                   This grant will support nuclear physics research by a                     
              faculty member and several undergraduate students at the State                 
              University of New York at Geneseo for three years.                             
              Experiments to determine the precise nature of nuclear                         
              reaction mechanisms involving heavy ion projectiles will be                    
              carried out at a large university nuclear physics laboratory,                  
              the University of Rochester, during the summer months.  The                    
              data analysis will be carried out during the academic year at                  
              Geneseo.  Earlier data from experiments at Florida State                       
              University will also be interpreted within the scope of this                   
              grant.  The grant is part of the NSF Research in Undergraduate                 
              Institutions (RUI) program.
