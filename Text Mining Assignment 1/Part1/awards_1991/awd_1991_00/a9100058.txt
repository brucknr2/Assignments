Abstract    :
                   Low-intensity elective logging of tropical forests is a                   
              promising means of according tropical forests economic value,                  
              thus providing a financial incentive for their retention.                      
              Currently lacking, but vital, are good data on the demography of               
              timber species in order to make selective harvesting of tropical               
              timber species sustainable.                                                    
                   This study will examine in detail the ecology and demography              
              of mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla), a valuable hardwood species               
              in the Neotropics.  Dr. Hubbell will study the demography of                   
              mahogany in (1) pristine forest, (ii) in recently logges forests,              
              and (iii) forest logged 20 years ago.  Demographic data from                   
              pristine forest will identify the factors responsible for                      
              controlling the abundance of mahogany in natural populations.                  
              Demographic data from the recently logged forest will provide                  
              data on immediate mortality of individuals during logging, and                 
              estimates of residual stocking after logging.  The demography of               
              mahogany in forest logging twenty year ago will provide data on                
              the long-term response of natural populations to selective                     
              logging.  Information from this study will aid in assessing the                
              sustainability of current logging operations, and through                      
              simulation models, developing better forest management practises.              
                   Dr. Hubbell will also assist in forming a long-term research              
              program by (i) training Bolivian nationals in data collection and              
              analysis techniques, and (ii) establishing permanent forest                    
              inventory plots, which will provide the basis for future research              
              on other potentially commercial species.
