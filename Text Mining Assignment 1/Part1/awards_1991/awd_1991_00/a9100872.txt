Abstract    :
                   This research project concerns the value distribution of                  
              meromorphic maps from parabolic manifolds into projective space and            
              projective varieties.  Special attention will be given to moving               
              targets, the Griffiths conjecture, questions concerning                        
              hyperbolicity and the analogy to diophantine approximations.  These            
              investigations will use curvature methods, meromorphic connections,            
              jet metrics, Nochka weights and Steinmetz maps.  Also the splitting            
              of parabolic manifolds will be investigated by foliation methods.              
                   This research is in the general area of geometric analysis                
              which examines the geometric properties of surfaces, or more                   
              generally, manifolds.  The analytic setting of this research will              
              be in the theory of several complex variables.
