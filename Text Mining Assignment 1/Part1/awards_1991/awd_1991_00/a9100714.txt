Abstract    :
                   This contract is for the conduct and data processing of the               
              Survey of Graduate Students and Postdoctorates in Science and                  
              Engineering, conducted annually to yield data on the field                     
              distribution, sources and types of support, sex, citizenship, and              
              racial/ethnic background of students enrolled in graduate                      
              programs in science and engineering fields, and on the number,                 
              sources of funding, sex, and citizenship of science/engineering                
              postdoctorates employed by institutions of higher education.  The              
              contractor will generate detailed statistical tables displaying                
              survey results and provide technical support as needed.                        
                   As part of its requirement under the National Science                     
              Foundation Act, as amended, to provide a central clearinghouse                 
              for the collection, interpretation, and analysis of data on the                
              current and projected availability of scientific and engineering               
              resources and personnel in the United States, NSF collects and                 
              disseminates statistical data on detailed characteristics of                   
              graduate science and engineering enrollment in academic                        
              institutions.  Data derived from this survey series are used by                
              internal NSF management and the National Science Board. as well                
              as by analysts at the Federal, State, and institutional levels to              
              predict changes in the supply of scientists and engineers and, in              
              combination with demand projections based on other sources, to                 
              generate early warning of possible imbalances of supply and                    
              demand.
