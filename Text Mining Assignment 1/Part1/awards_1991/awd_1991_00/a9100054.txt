Abstract    :
                   Habitat use during migration has profound consequences for a              
              bird's ability to satisfy energy requirements, vulnerability to                
              predators, and exposure to environmental  stress.  The proposed                
              research quantifies habitat use during spring and fall en route                
              periods.  Presumably migrants select particular habitats because               
              they thereby enhance their fitness.  Although it would be                      
              difficult to measure directly the effect of en route use of                    
              habitat on survival and reproductive success, it is possible to                
              evaluate the immediate consequences in relation to how                         
              effectively migrants satisfy energy demand during migration, i.e.              
              deposit fat reserves and gain body mass.                                       
                   Over half of all North American landbirds are long-distance               
              migrants that journey between temperature breeding ranges and                  
              more tropical wintering areas.  Decline in populations of                      
              Neotropical landbird migrants is linked to habitat loss on the                 
              wintering grounds and fragmentation of forested breeding                       
              habitats.  Because the persistence of migrant populations depends              
              on the bird's ability to find favorable conditions throughout the              
              annual cycle, factors associated with the en route ecology of                  
              migrants must figure in the formulation of sound conservation                  
              policy.
