Abstract    :
              Professor Gerald Caple and other members of the Chemistry                      
              Department of Northern Arizona University are being supported                  
              to continue a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU)                    
              site in Chemistry.  For the period 1991-93, eight undergraduate                
              students will spend ten weeks each summer actively engaged in a                
              variety of research projects.  Projects include investigation                  
              of aniline copolymers, analysis of clays from prehistoric                      
              ruins, and monitoring of groundwater in uranium mining                         
              districts.  Students will meet weekly to discuss their research                
              progress and will also attend a weekly seminar on general                      
              interest topics, such as safety and careers opportunities.                     
              Students will make at least one oral presenation on their                      
              results and, in addition, will make a presentation at a                        
              national conference.  The participants will be Native                          
              Americans.
