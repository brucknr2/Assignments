Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              In this research the influence of an innovative processing method              
              on the mechanical behavior of ceramic materials will be studied. In            
              particular, it is proposed to control crystallographic texture by              
              magnetically-assisted grain alignment during the processing of                 
              paramagnetic ceramics, namely iron titanate and yttrium barium                 
              copper high temperature superconductor material. It is expected                
              that controlled texture may influence the magnitude of residual                
              stresses within the microstructure of these ceramics, and hence,               
              the magnitude of grain bridging and microcracking induced                      
              toughening. The PI will collaborate with researchers at NIST to                
              measure residual stresses with neutron diffraction and                         
              microcracking with neutron scattering in-situ as the material is               
              cooled from processing temperature. It is expected that these                  
              studies will provide a general framework for microstructural design            
              and mechanical property control of ceramics by the application of              
              a magnetic field during processing.
