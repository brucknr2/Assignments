Abstract    :
                   Professor Semmes' research project will cover two areas.  The             
              first deals with harmonic analysis and geometric measure theory.               
              It is concerned with certain quantitative notions of rectifiability            
              and their relationship to boundedness of singular integral                     
              operators.  The second area deals with generalized Riemann mappings            
              in several complex variables.  The goal is to find classes of                  
              mappings defined by conditions much weaker than the requirement of             
              being biholomorphic, so that there is a reasonable existence                   
              theory, but in such a way that these mappings reflect a large part             
              of the complex structure.                                                      
                   Professor Semmes' research in harmonic analysis involves the              
              study of certain kinds of functions on infinite dimensional spaces             
              that arise, for example, in the study of the boundary value                    
              problems of mathematical physics.  His study of generalized Riemann            
              mapping functions is an attempt to better understand the geometry              
              of functions of many complex variables, a subject infinitely more              
              complicated than the theory of one complex variable.
