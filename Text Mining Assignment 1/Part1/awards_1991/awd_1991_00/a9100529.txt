Abstract    :
                   An eight-week program of Research Experience for                          
              Undergraduates will be supported by this award. Ten students will              
              work on a combination of individual projects. There will be enough             
              faculty participating so that each student may be paired with an               
              individual advisor. There will also be ample opportunity for                   
              interaction and discussion among the students themselves. The                  
              principal investigators are also planning a cooperative effort with            
              Oak Ridge National Laboratory which will give students the                     
              opportunity to work at the laboratory on problems of interest to               
              mathematicians.  This will place extensive computer facilities at              
              the disposal of the students at no extra cost.                                 
                   There are a large number of sample projects scheduled for the             
              program. The students will work on numerical algorithms which                  
              involve parallel processing, modeling of heat and mass transfer                
              processes, and factorization properties of integral domains. They              
              will also study maximum principles for elliptic systems and the                
              classification of knots. The number of topics should help the                  
              students appreciate the variety of problems which are of interest              
              to mathematical scientists.
