Abstract    :
                   This workshop is a two-day forum designed to bring together               
              leading researchers from industry and academia to identify the                 
              crucial research needs in electronics manufacturing.  The results              
              of the workshop can be used by other members of the research                   
              community to focus their efforts in areas of greatest potential                
              benefit and by sponsors to encourage research in areas of highest              
              priority.                                                                      
                   Workshop results will be disseminated through a final report              
              summarizing the workshop presentations and recommendations.  In                
              addition, articles summarizing recommendations will be submitted               
              for publication to organizations such as the Institution of                    
              Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE), the Institution of                 
              Industrial Engineers (IIE), American Society of Engineering                    
              Education (ASEE), and the American Society of Mechanical Engineers             
              (ASME).
