Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              This award funds a continuation of fundamental research on the                 
              properties of very distant radio galaxies by one of the world                  
              leaders in this field.  Investigations of these objects will                   
              attempt to locate objects still in the accumulation phase which                
              will later form the early galaxies.  The relation between the                  
              optical and radio emission of early active galaxies will be studied            
              to help explore the origin of the light, emitted in the                        
              ultraviolet, which we see red-shifted into the visible portion of              
              the spectrum.
