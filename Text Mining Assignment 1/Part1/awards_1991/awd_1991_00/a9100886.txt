Abstract    :
              This project will study the complexity of interactive computational            
              models.  One goal of this research is to improve known results on the          
              complexity of models such as interactive proof systems, multi-prover           
              systems,  and games against nature.  Research on these models has              
              applications to problems in optimization and automata theory, and in           
              understanding properties of some types of stochastic processes, such           
              as their rate of convergence to absorbing states.  Another goal is to          
              address a major question in theoretical computer science--how                  
              randomness and nondeterminism help in computation.
