Abstract    :
                   This award is to support research done by a number of                     
              principal investigators at the University of Chicago for a                     
              three year period.  Projects covered by the proposal fall into                 
              four main groups.  The first of these is concerned with three                  
              experiments at Fermilab focussing on neutral K meson decays to                 
              determine parameters appropriate to CP and to CPT violation,                   
              and to study rare K decays.  The second group studies very                     
              high energy proton antiproton annihilations using the Tevatron                 
              Collider Detector Facility (CDF), also at Fermilab.  Important                 
              goals of this experiment include the determination of the mass                 
              of the W boson and also limits on the mass of the illusive t                   
              quark which has so far evaded all attempts at observation.  A                  
              third group uses the OPAL spectrometer at the LEP accelerator                  
              at CERN to study decays of Z bosons.  The Z results are                        
              completely complementary to those of the CDF experiment in                     
              understanding the standard model, and any flaws that may exist                 
              in it.  The fourth group is in an experiment aimed at a search                 
              for decays of stopping muons, produced at the Los Alamos                       
              facility LAMPF, to positronphoton pairs.  Flavour changing                     
              decays of leptons, of which such events would be an example,                   
              have never been observed.  The standard model predicts no such                 
              decays.
