Abstract    :
              The Duke University/ University of North Carolina Oceano-                      
              graphic Consortium will provide shipboard technical services                   
              associated with the research vessel CAPE HATTERAS, a 135-foot                  
              research vessel that is owned by the NSF and operated by the                   
              University.  A significant portion of the ship's operating                     
              schedule in recent years and again in 1991 is in support of                    
              NSF-sponsored research projects.  The Shipboard Technician                     
              Program has two components: an at-sea component and an ashore                  
              component.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              The at-sea component consists of instructing scientific                        
              personnel in the use of shared shipboard equipment;                            
              maintenance, repair, and calibration of scientific                             
              instrumentation; instruction and supervision of deck                           
              operations; and providing logistics assistance to on-coming                    
              and off-going scientific parties.  On shore activities                         
              include the maintenance, repair, and calibration of shared                     
              use seagoing equipment and assisting scientific personnel in                   
              preparing for field work on the vessel.  Shipboard                             
              technicians funded by this award have broad responsibilities                   
              for providing the coordination and assistance needed for the                   
              successful completion of research projects at sea.  The level                  
              of activity and amount of support are closely related to the                   
              size and capability of the vessel, and its scientific outfit                   
              and capability.
