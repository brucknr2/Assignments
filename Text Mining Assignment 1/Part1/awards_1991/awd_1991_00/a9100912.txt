Abstract    :
              Professor Wayland E. Noland and other members of the Chemistry                 
              Department at the University of Minnesota are being supported                  
              to conduct a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site                
              in Chemistry.  For the period 1991-93, eight undergraduate                     
              students will spend ten weeks each summer actively engaged in a                
              variety of research projects.  Some of the research projects                   
              involve the properties of micelles, far infrared spectroscopy,                 
              polymer science, and synthesis of organometallic compounds and                 
              of antifungal agents.  The program will close with an all-day                  
              symposium at which students will present formal papers on their                
              research.
