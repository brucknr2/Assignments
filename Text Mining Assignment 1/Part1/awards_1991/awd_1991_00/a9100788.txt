Abstract    :
                   This project will bring 12 undergraduate students to                      
              Utah State University for 8 weeks during the Summer of 1991                    
              to do research in parallel processing.  They will receive                      
              formal instruction in parallel algorithms, fine grain versus                   
              coarse grain parallelism, recognition of parallelism,                          
              debugging of parallel algorithms, tools for dealing with                       
              parallel algorithms, and parallel algorithms in 3D medical                     
              image technology.  After the instructional phase students                      
              will be involved in research projects from these areas.
