Abstract    :
              This award provides support to continue an REU Site at the                     
              Demographic Research Laboratory, Western Washington University.                
              Ten undergraduates, recruited nationwide, will participate in                  
              "Applied Demographic Research on Migration" for two months in the              
              Summer, 1991.  These students, supervised by a project team of                 
              professional demographers, will focus their research efforts on                
              the study of migration profiles and analytical models.  Public                 
              Use Microdata Samples and the County to County Migration Flow                  
              files will serve as primary data sources for the research                      
              experiences for undergraduates.  The project provides                          
              undergraduates the opportunity to become involved in the research              
              process and to expand their research-related competencies through              
              an intensive, two-month research project.
