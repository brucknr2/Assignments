Abstract    :
              This is a study of the effects of catalyst preparation and                     
              treatment on the structure and reactivity of VPO (vanadium                     
              phosphorus oxide or "vanadium phosphate") catalysts for the                    
              partial oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride.  The core                   
              strategy is the incorporation of silicon into the VPO system,                  
              influencing the morphology, redox potential, and acidity of                    
              the catalyst; silicon should stabilize the vanadyl                             
              pyrophosphate phases, considered beneficial for the desired                    
              catalytic effect.  Catalyst materials prepared are                             
              characterized by X-ray diffraction, Fourier-transform                          
              photoacoustic spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy,                  
              chemisorption, and kinetic measurements to establish                           
              structure, morphology, and activity.  Also examined is the                     
              effect of water vapor on the acidity, activity, and                            
              selectivity of the catalysts.                                                  
                                                                                             
              Maleic anhydride is an important industrial product as a                       
              chemical intermediate in the production of a number of                         
              important monomers, drugs, and pesticides.  It is now made by                  
              catalytic oxidation of butane; the low cost of the feedstock                   
              makes this feasible despite the limited yield.  The objective                  
              of this work is to identify the cause of the yield limitation;                 
              if it can be circumvented, the economic impact would be major.
