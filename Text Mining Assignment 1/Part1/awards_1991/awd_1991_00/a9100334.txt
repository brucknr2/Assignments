Abstract    :
              An ideal place to begin learning what options are available to me              
              is the Society of Neuroscience meeting on October 27 - November 2,             
              1990, in St. Louis.  The Society has a placement service and many              
              groups that will serve as important contacts, such as a women's                
              meeting and a minorities group.  Also there will be personnel and              
              representative from diverse research centers I can meet personally.            
              The poster sessions will offer me an opportunity to meet scientists            
              in the field I am interested in.
