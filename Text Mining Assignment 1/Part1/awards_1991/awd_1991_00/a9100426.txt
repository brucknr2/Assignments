Abstract    :
              This grant, supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry                  
              Program in the Chemistry Division, will study a highly                         
              sensitive and selective means for detecting and quantifying the                
              chemical elements found in solid materials.  A laser will                      
              vaporize a small portion of the solid, and then a second laser                 
              will selectively ionize one element of interest.  Isotopic                     
              information will also be obtained.  All work will be done by                   
              undergraduates under the direction of the principal                            
              investigator.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              %%%                                                                            
                                                                                             
              This research, supported by the Analytical and Surface                         
              Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division, will study the                    
              fundamental physics and chemistry of Resonance Ionization Mass                 
              Spectrometry for elemental analysis.  Condensation dynamics                    
              which have limited this technique's sensitivity will be                        
              investigated, as will mass transport from the vaporization                     
              region to the mass spectrometer.  Quantification of elements                   
              and their isotopes in inclusions in solids should be improved                  
              by the success of this research.
