Abstract    :
              This award provides funds to establish an REU Site project at the              
              Psychology Department of Clark University.  The program is                     
              designed to build upon and make more effective a formal                        
              curriculum known as the Research Apprenticeship Program.  The                  
              training model features apprenticeship, hands-on teaching, where               
              students learn by actively participating in all phases of a                    
              research study-- from problem formulation to data collection and               
              analysis to presentation at a professional meeting, manuscript                 
              preparation and publication.  Students may work with one of 16                 
              Faculty Associates, whose interests collectively address                       
              biological, physiological and sociocultural aspects of behavior                
              and represent the full spectrum of university-level scholarship                
              in psychology, from neuroanatomy to literary analysis, from work               
              with animals to studies of peoples in foreign cultures.  Specific              
              features of the proposed project include (1) funding summer                    
              research, (2) scheduling University Conferences and Summer                     
              Seminars to promote collegial scientific discourse with and among              
              students, (3) funding student paper presentations at professional              
              meetings and (4) extending opportunities for research experiences              
              to students outside the Clark community, particularly to women,                
              blacks, and Hispanics.  These features support the principal goal              
              of the REU program, to promote careers in scientific research.
