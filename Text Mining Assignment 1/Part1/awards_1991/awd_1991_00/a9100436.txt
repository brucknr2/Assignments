Abstract    :
                   The goal of the conference is to facilitate description,                  
              discussion, and documentation of current knowledge about                       
              precipitation scavenging and atmosphere-surface exchange                       
              processes.  The themes for the conference are measurements of and              
              models for scavenging and air-surface exchange processes,                      
              adequacies of representations of these processes for current                   
              applications, and requirements for applications to future                      
              problems, such as those associated with atmospheric oxidants,                  
              hazardous wastes, and global environmental change.  The                        
              conference will be held in Richland, Washington, 15-19 July,                   
              1991.
