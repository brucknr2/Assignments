Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award supports a continuing program of investigations                     
              into the physics of extragalactic radio sources by two of the                  
              leading contributors to this field.  Using the supernova remnant               
              Cassiopeia A as a Rosetta stone for the process of particle                    
              acceleration, a unified program of numerical simulation and high               
              resolution observations will probe the mechanisms which provide                
              the relativistic particles producing the non-thermal emission of               
              radio galaxies.
