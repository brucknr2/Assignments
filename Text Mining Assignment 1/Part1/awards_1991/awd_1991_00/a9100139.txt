Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The proposal seeks to develop a novel method for the analysis                  
              of radiation scattering data from a broad class of materials,                  
              ranging from atomic to supramolecular.  The method seeks to                    
              obtain the details of the effective interatomic or                             
              interparticle forces to an extent which has not been possible                  
              previously, and is useful at conditions at which such forces                   
              dominate interfacial phenomena and macroscopic behavior and                    
              properties of the materials.  The focus of the work is in the                  
              study of colloidal materials and micellar and microemulsion                    
              systems.  However, the potential impact of the work is broader                 
              and can be applied to the study of simple liquids and liquid                   
              metals as well as structurally arrested materials such as gels                 
              and glasses.  This work will be coordinated with x-ray,                        
              neutron, and light scattering studies currently in progress.
