Abstract    :
                   This research is concerned with the study of new classes of               
              graded algebras including Sklyanin algebras, regular algebras and              
              algebras related to quantum groups. The goal is to understand their            
              representation theory in geometric terms.  The principal                       
              investigator will study the finite dimensional simple modules of               
              Sklyanin algebras.  He will examine higher dimensional Sklyanin                
              algebras for properties such as regularity and noetherian chain                
              conditions.  He will also examine their properties from a                      
              deformation perspective.                                                       
                   This research is in the general area of noncommutative ring               
              theory.  The rings considered in the project are of interest in                
              many areas of mathematics including algebraic geometry.  Given a               
              curve, one of these rings can be associated with certain points on             
              the curve.  A better understanding of these rings and this                     
              association will be useful in determining the geometry of a given              
              curve.
