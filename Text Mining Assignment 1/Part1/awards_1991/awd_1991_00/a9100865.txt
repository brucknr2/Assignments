Abstract    :
              Recent research in econometrics and statistics has focused on many             
              problems that are of common interest to both disciplines. One that             
              is especially noteworthy is functional central limit theory and its            
              manifold applications in statistical theory, time series and                   
              microeconometrics. This project will foster the growing interaction            
              between professional statisticians and econometricians in this                 
              general field. Building on current areas of strength at Yale                   
              University, five members of the Economics and Statistics                       
              Departments will develop a series of intensive workshops on                    
              functional limit theory and its applications: statistical analyses             
              of trending time series, cointegrated systems, long-run equilibria             
              and transient dynamics, semiparametrics, empirical processes for               
              dependent variables and possibly estimation via simulation methods,            
              and structural change/change point problems. The workshops will                
              bring together small groups of researchers, both well-established              
              and new contributors, to review current progress and explore future            
              directions. The workshops will be supplemented by visits from                  
              leading overseas researchers, who will give lecture series at the              
              cutting edge of their specialties on subject matter that is closely            
              related to the workshop themes.
