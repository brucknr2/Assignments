Abstract    :
                   This project will support 8 students during the summer                    
              of 1991 and 8 more students during the academic year 1991-92                   
              to do research in the Intelligent Structures Group within the                  
              Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the                       
              University of New Hampshire.  The research projects revolve                    
              around the development of new hardware structures for                          
              embedding intelligence in dedicated electronic systems.                        
              Basic research is performed in the areas of distributed                        
              fault-tolerance, neural networks, synthetic vision, and                        
              learning systems in control and signal processing.
