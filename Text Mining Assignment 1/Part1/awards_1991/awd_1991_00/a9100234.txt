Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Geological Sample Storage facilitites provide important and                    
              essential services to the geological research community. The core              
              repository facility at Scripps Institution of Oceanography is                  
              being funded to archive cores and other geological rock samples                
              from the seafloor and provide the important services of sample                 
              distribution and related data dissemination to the marine                      
              geological, sedimentological and paleoceanographic communities.
