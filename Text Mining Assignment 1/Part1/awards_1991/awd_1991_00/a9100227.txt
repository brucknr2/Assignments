Abstract    :
                   This grant is to support a proposal requesting funds for                  
              travel grants to support U.S. logicians participating in the IXth              
              International Congress of Logic, Methodology and Philosophy of                 
              Science to be held in August in Uppsala, Sweden.  This Congress                
              provides one of the principal international summer meetings for                
              logicians; this year its importance is increased due to the fact               
              that the Congress includes the 1991 European Summer Meeting of the             
              Association for Symbolic Logic.  American representation at this               
              meeting is important not only for the benefit of researchers from              
              other countries, but also for the Americans themselves.  Being                 
              large and drawing from many different subjects, this meeting offers            
              a singular chance for a researcher to understand the possible                  
              connections that his/her own work has on other areas of the                    
              mathematical sciences.
