Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The description of human anatomical growth and development is a                
              longstanding interest of physical anthropology.  Not only is this              
              of interest vis a vis modern humans, but also as a means of                    
              describing the altering patterns of growth which have occurred                 
              over evolutionary time.  The complex changes in morphology which               
              proceed in the development of an individual are by no means easy               
              to describe or quantify.                                                       
                                                                                             
              The objective of this proposal is to characterize the growth of                
              the basicranium and face of modern humans during fetal and early               
              post-partum periods.  This will involve two stages.  Data on the               
              alterations in the positions of a series of cranial landmarks                  
              will be generated through the use of computed tomography.  Once                
              available, the data can then be analyzed using two mathematical                
              models: Finite Element Scaling Analysis and Euclidean Distance                 
              Matrix Analysis.  These models will allow the PIs to more fully                
              describe the alterations in the shape of the human skull over the              
              the fetal period.  Additionally it will be possible to start to                
              describe the range of variation in normal human growth during                  
              this period.  Ultimately, such data will allow for discussion of               
              the variation in growth patterns seen throughout the primates.
