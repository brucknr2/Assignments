Abstract    :
              Professor Margaret V. Merritt and other members of the                         
              Chemistry Department of Wellesley College are being supported                  
              to continue a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU)                    
              site in Chemistry.  For the period 1991-93, nine undergraduate                 
              students will spend ten weeks each summer actively engaged in a                
              variety of research projects.  Some of the research projects                   
              involve molecular beam experiments, hydrogen bonding in                        
              supermolecules, and identification of natural products.                        
              Students will attend a weekly seminar series and discussions of                
              research progress and two field trips to industrial                            
              laboratories.  Each student will prepare a final report and                    
              give a poster presentation.  Participants will be predominantly                
              women and minorites.
