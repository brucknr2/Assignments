Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Support is provided for the Eighth International Conference for                
              Stereology, 25-30 August 1991.  The conference main goals are to               
              bring attention to the field of quantitative characterization of               
              materials and to act as a catalyst for new methods and as a forum              
              for new ideas.  The Proceedings are to be published as a special               
              edition of Acta Stereologica.  Scientists representing several                 
              disciplines (materials science and engineering, biology,                       
              mathematics, geology) attend the conference.  This brings about a              
              valuable synergism of ideas and needs to advance the field.
