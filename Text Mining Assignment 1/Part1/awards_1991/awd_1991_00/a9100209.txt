Abstract    :
              Interactions of Toxic Trace Metals With Multi-Component                        
              Biofilms: A Mechanistic Approach.                                              
                                                                                             
              This is a renewal award for support of research conducted                      
              under NSF Grant No. 86-17408 on the adsorption behavior of                     
              cadmium and lead in water solution to solid surfaces that                      
              had become coated with biofilms.  Results led to                               
              development of a mechanistically-based, structured model                       
              that can be used to predict the behavior of these metals                       
              in an experimental system consisting of a single bacterial                     
              species, its extracellular polymer and a solid surface                         
              under conditions of constant pH and ionic strength.  The                       
              objective of the renewal project is to extend this                             
              approach by introduction of ferric iron as a competing                         
              trace metal to provide a degree of complexity more                             
              analagous to conditions found in the natural environment                       
              where adsorption of metals to solid surfaces is of                             
              environmental significance.                                                    
                                                                                             
              Results of this research are expected to develop knowledge                     
              of factors that influence the formation of biofilms on                         
              solid surfaces including fixed-film, biofilm reactors that                     
              are used for the treatment of wastewaters.  Insights                           
              obtained during this project are expected to lead to                           
              improvements in the engineering design of fixed-film                           
              processes for wastewater treatment and may be applied to                       
              obtaining a better understanding than now exists of                            
              mechanisms for biofilm formation in sediments underlying                       
              natural surface waters and in subsurface formations that                       
              affect the movement of groundwater pollutants.
