Abstract    :
                   Earthworms show promise of being excellent indicators of                  
              vicariance events, due to their apparent failure to cross salt                 
              water.  Unfortunately, so little is known about earthworms in the              
              Caribbean Basin that they cannot be used to test any                           
              biogeographical hypotheses.                                                    
                   This project aims to partially correct that deficiency by                 
              conducting a complete survey of the Greater Antilles and some of               
              the Lesser Antilles.  The Trigaster group of genera and the Central            
              American and Antillean Notiodrilus will be revised based on the                
              collections to be made.  Data derived from the survey will be used             
              to test the hypothesis that earthworms have not dispersed to the               
              volcanic southern Lesser Antilles.  This project will provide the              
              distributional and taxonomic data necessary to begin work on larger            
              biogeographical and geological questions about Caribbean Basin                 
              history, as well as on important species conservation and                      
              ecological concerns.
