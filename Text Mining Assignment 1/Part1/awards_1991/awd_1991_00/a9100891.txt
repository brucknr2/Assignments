Abstract    :
                   This awards supports the research of Professor Teixidor-                  
              i-Bigas. to work in algebraic geometry.  She will work on                      
              extending the Brill-Noether theory of vector bundles to                        
              bundles of higher rank.  as well as moduli spaces of singular                  
              curves.                                                                        
                   The research is in the field of algebraic geometry, one                   
              of the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which                       
              blossomed to the point where it has, in the past 10 years,                     
              solved problems that have stood for centuries. Originally, it                  
              treated figures defined in the plane by the simplest of                        
              equations, namely polynomials. Today, the field uses methods                   
              not only from algebra, but also from analysis and topology,                    
              and conversely it is extensively used in those fields.                         
              Moreover it has proved itself useful in fields as diverse as                   
              physics, theoretical computer science, cryptography, coding                    
              theory and robotics.
