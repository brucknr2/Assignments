Abstract    :
              After completion of my degree I will be pursuing postdoctoral in               
              the field of gene expression.  I intend to explore the area of                 
              regulation of RNA processing in viral systems.  I have selected the            
              Pasteur Institute in Paris as my first choice for several reasons.             
              First, the contributions from the Pasteur Institute to basic                   
              science research, especially in the field of virology, have been               
              outstanding.  From a review of the literature, it appears to me                
              that their scientific community as well as their technical assets              
              provide an excellent resource of quality research.  Second, I                  
              perceive that exposure to the scientific approach of the European              
              community would be an experience of great benefit.  I base this                
              opinion on my previous experience of moving into the mainland USA,             
              which has been the single most beneficial step for my scientific               
              and cultural life.
