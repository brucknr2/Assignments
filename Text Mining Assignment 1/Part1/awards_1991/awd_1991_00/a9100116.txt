Abstract    :
              A significant component of this investigation is                               
              the study combined-mode, radiation and                                         
              conduction, heat-transfer problems in plane-                                   
              parallel media and in spheres and cylinders.                                   
              An especially concise form for the required                                    
              particular solution will be used, along with the                               
              classical spherical-harmonics method of solving                                
              the radiation equation can be carried out                                      
              without gross approximations in the solution of                                
              either equation.  A portion of this study will                                 
              be focused on seeking better understanding of                                  
              the heat-transfer mechanisms that can give rise                                
              to a loss of convergence in standard iterative                                 
              solutions.                                                                     
              A second component of this research project,                                   
              the spherical-harmonics method is to be used                                   
              to develop solutions to a class of multi-group                                 
              or non-grey radiation-transport problems.  The                                 
              multi-group model to be considered allows a                                    
              general anisotropic scattering law and transfer                                
              from any group to any group.                                                   
              Computational aspects of the developed                                         
              solutions are to be investigated, and numerical                                
              results for numerous test cases are to be                                      
              developed.  Once the solution technique for                                    
              the non-grey has been established and tested                                   
              numerically for the plane-parallel case, some                                  
              extensions will then be made to problems with                                  
              spherical and cylindrical symmetry.
