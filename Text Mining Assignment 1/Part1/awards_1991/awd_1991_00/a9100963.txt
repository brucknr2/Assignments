Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a Research Experiences for Undergraduates Site grant.                  
              The award permits undergraduate students to participate in a                   
              research program in the materials field under the supervision of               
              faculty members actively engaged in research.  The grant involves              
              research experiences for six undergraduate students at the                     
              University of Houston, Texas Southern University, University of                
              Houston-Downtown Campus, and Sam Houston State University.  Texas              
              Southern is a historically black university.  The goal is to have              
              half of the students involved be minority.  Students from the                  
              various campuses meet monthly to discuss progress and present                  
              results in seminars.  Students first attend training classes to                
              acquire required skills specific to individual research projects,              
              such as operation of equipment and safety procedures.                          
              Thereafter, students elect to participate on individual research               
              projects under supervision of a faculty member.  Typical topics                
              for research include: electron transport in semiconducting and                 
              superconducting materials, study of thin films using energy                    
              dispersive spectroscopy in a scanning electron microscope,                     
              chemical beam epitaxy of thin films, characterization of thin                  
              films using infrared spectroscopy and electron spin resonance.                 
              The program enhances current research activities as well as                    
              adding to the number of scientifically trained individuals.  It                
              is hoped that this hands-on experience will serve as a stimulus                
              to attract and retain highly-gifted students into careers in                   
              teaching and research.
