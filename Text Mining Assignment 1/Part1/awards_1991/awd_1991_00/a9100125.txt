Abstract    :
              This proposal requests partial support for a FASEB Summer Research             
              Conference on Genetic Recombination and Genome Rearrangements to be            
              held at Saxtons River, Vermont, July 28 - August 2, 1991.                      
              Recombination and genome rearrangements are central to our                     
              understanding of inheritance and this conference is the only                   
              regularly scheduled meeting in the United States that is                       
              exclusively devoted to these topics. The meeting provides a crucial            
              interface between scientists interested in the mechanistic aspects             
              of recombination and those interested in more practical                        
              applications.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              The environment of this meeting will encourage young scientists                
              interested in these areas of research to interact with more                    
              established investigators in an optimal way as well as allowing and            
              encouraging discussions between the established investigators.
