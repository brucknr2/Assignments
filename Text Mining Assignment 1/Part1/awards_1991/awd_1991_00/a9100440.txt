Abstract    :
                   An understanding if solar flare generation must be based on               
              an understanding of observational data.  The interpretation of                 
              the large amounts of data presently available presents many                    
              problems.  These include identifying independent observational                 
              data types and developing an appropriate model with which to                   
              utilize the data.  By utilizing a number of different techniques,              
              including artificial intelligence techniques, it is expected to                
              gain knowledge regarding the presence of precursors to M-class                 
              flares.  This will benefit solar physicists involved with the                  
              modelling of solar phenomena, since they may gain insight into                 
              the relationships between observational data and the underlying                
              physical processes.  It will also benefit forecasters making                   
              solar flare predictions and aid in experimental planning within                
              the near Earth environment.  ***
