Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to encourage more outstanding undergraduates       
              to pursue research careers.  Considerable experience has been gained in        
              the last four years with successful REU sites.  This year the program          
              is continued with the key aspects of the previous years including:  (1)        
              a successful recruitment program; (2) careful matching of student              
              interests with available research projects; (3) an effective management        
              structure; (4) research assignments the students can quickly grasp and         
              complete in the proposed time frame; and (5) follow-up procedures              
              designed to maintain student interest in research.  The four research          
              projects involve probabilistic methods, state-of-the-art soils testing,        
              scale modeling, structural testing, and soil-structure interaction.  Two       
              students are involved in each project to allow for student interaction.        
              Interaction is also fostered by group seminars and meetings.  Follow-          
              through strategies include a newsletter mailed after the REU student           
              leaves the University of Maine.  The students have full use of advanced        
              laboratories and computational facilities.
