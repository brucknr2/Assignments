Abstract    :
                   This project will develop the optics portion of an upper-                 
              level physics major laboratory course.  Undergraduate physics                  
              majors will play an important role, under the guidance of the                  
              Principal Investigator, in developing the actual experiments and               
              then in preparing the manuals and syllabi.  This involvement of                
              undergraduates will bring in an important point of view.                       
                   The results will be shared widely with other schools.
