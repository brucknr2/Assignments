Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Massachusetts Institute of Technology Haystack Observatory will            
              provide research experiences in radio astronomy and atmospheric                
              science for 21 undergraduate students during the summers of 1991,              
              1992, and 1993.  The Observatory, located in Westford,                         
              massachusetts, operates large radio telescopes for studies of                  
              molecular line emission from galactic and extragalactic radio                  
              sources and utilizes high-power radars for the study of the earth's            
              upper atmosphere.  The Observatory is also engaged in the                      
              development of instrumentation for interferometry and other radio              
              science applications.  Under the guidance of the Observatory staff,            
              the students will be engaged in both scientific and technical                  
              projects and, through hands-on assignments, will be exposed to the             
              excitement of research.  The program will continue the successful              
              participation by Haystack Observatory in the Research Experiences              
              for Undergraduates program since 1987.  The research projects are              
              supplemented by a series of seminars, facility tours, research                 
              discussions, report preparation, and participation in and                      
              presentation of research work at conferences.  Follow-on activities            
              are planned for the students at the end of each summer program.
