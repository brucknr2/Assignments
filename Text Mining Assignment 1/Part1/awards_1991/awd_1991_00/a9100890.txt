Abstract    :
              During the past five years, UT Arlington's Department of Electrical            
              Engineering has conducted an experimental program involving                    
              undergraduate scholars in research projects.  This program builds on the       
              past experience.  Specifically, this current program is strengthened by        
              increasing the funding, raising the number of students to eight,               
              providing research opportunities during summers, and emphasizing               
              recruitment of underrepresented US citizens and permanent residents in         
              electrical engineering.  The philosophy of the program is the                  
              integration of undergraduate scholars into existing research projects          
              and the significant interaction between faculty and students.  The             
              scholars are encouraged to be creative and productive and are expected         
              to gain considerable independence during two consecutive academic              
              semesters.  A full-time summer research opportunity is then available          
              with significant research contributions possible.
