Abstract    :
              This award provides funds to continue a Research Experiences for               
              Undergraduates Site at the Department of Biochemistry at the                   
              University of Arizona for another three years.  NSF funds will                 
              provide stipends for nine students with the University of Arizona              
              providing stipends for an additional ten students.  Students will              
              apply to the REU program and once selected by a faculty/student                
              committee, they interview several of the 110 participating                     
              faculty sponsors before deciding with whom they wish to work.                  
              This matching process insures that students will be working on a               
              problem that is of interest to them and fosters a productive                   
              working relationship.  Students then pursue their research                     
              problems as part of a research group.  In addition to students'                
              research, lab meetings and seminars, the program offers an                     
              orientation that includes radiation and laboratory safety                      
              training and a weekly brown bag lunch where students and faculty               
              discuss issues and careers in biology and biological research.                 
              There is an annual Undergraduate Biology Research Conference and               
              an Undergraduate Biology Colloquium Series featuring world                     
              renowned biologists.  The common thread that unites the program                
              is that students are all involved in independent research on some              
              problem in biology.
