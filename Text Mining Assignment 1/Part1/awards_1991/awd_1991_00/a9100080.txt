Abstract    :
              Polar desert ecosystems in the high arctic have not been                       
              studied in terms of their development and function.  To                        
              provide an understanding of the critical components                            
              controlling development of polar desert ecosystems, Dr.                        
              Bliss proposes to study the microclimate of soils, algal                       
              crusts, soil invertebrates and vascular plants within these                    
              systems.  It is hypothesized that algal crusts, especially                     
              cyanobacteria, play a central role in soil development and                     
              to a greater extent species diversity and biomass of vascular                  
              plants.  The overall influence of biota on soil development                    
              will be estimated from carbon dioxide and carbonate analysis                   
              in the soil atmosphere and in solution.  To evaluate the                       
              hypothesis that the distribution of vascular plants relates                    
              primarily to water availability throughout the summer,                         
              winter snow fall and summer snow melt will be determined                       
              along moisture gradients.  It is further believed that the                     
              algal crusts play a central role in maintenance of higher                      
              levels of soil moisture.  Because polar deserts are one of                     
              the least understood ecosystems in the arctic, it is critical,                 
              in terms of predicted global warming to understand important                   
              components controlling development of polar deserts.                           
              Additionally, knowing how modern systems develop may provide                   
              an analog to development of systems following continental                      
              ice retreat.
