Abstract    :
                   A program of Research Experiences for Undergraduates                      
              involving 10 undergraduate students will be supported by this                  
              award.  The activity will run for eight weeks during the summer                
              of 1991.  Students will be assigned individual faculty advisors                
              and will work on projects closely allied with those of interest                
              to the advisor.  To foster interactions between students, they                 
              will be housed together.  In addition, frequent progress reports               
              will be given by students to the entire team.                                  
                   There will be a rich variety of research topics.  These                   
              include work on modeling uncertainty in economics, the wave and                
              Euler partial differential equations, the geometry of orbits of                
              linear groups and computer gaming.  All students will be briefed               
              on the use of mathematical software available, such as                         
              Mathmatica, Macsyma and Maple.  Reports at the conclusion of the               
              project will be required.                                                      
                   All of the faculty are currently involved in high-level                   
              mathematical research; this should add considerable currency to                
              the impressions made on the undergraduates.  It should be pointed              
              out that the Mathematics Department of Indiana University has a                
              long history of conducting summer programs designed to give                    
              mathematics majors research experience.  They started in the                   
              early 1970's, continuing until 1981 with support from the NSF                  
              Undergraduate Research Participation Program.
