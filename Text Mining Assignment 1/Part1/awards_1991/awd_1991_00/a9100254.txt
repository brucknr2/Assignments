Abstract    :
                   Dr. Cochran plans to continue his studies on concordance of               
              links and on invariants of manifolds of dimensions 3 and 4.  The               
              linking phenomena Dr. Cochran is studying are indicative of new                
              phenomena relating to the classification of four-dimensional                   
              spaces.  He will also study aspects of manifolds which have                    
              significance in the context of physics.                                        
                   Three and four-dimensional manifolds are important to us,                 
              since we live in a three-dimensional manifold if we ignore the                 
              time dimension and a four-dimensional manifold if we do not.                   
              What is intriguing about some of this work is that ideas from                  
              physics are solving purely geometric problems, not only the other              
              way around, which is more to be expected.
