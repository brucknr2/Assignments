Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The aim of this study is to contribute to a better understanding               
              of the metabolism and function of Vitamin D-3.  The goal of the                
              work outlined is to whether vitamin-binding proteins of liver                  
              cytosol are unique in binding properties, and stimulatory to                   
              metabolism of the vitamin by liver microsomes.  Isolation,                     
              purification, and identification of vitamin-binding proteins from              
              liver cytosol will be undertaken by conventional approaches, the               
              purified components will be assessed for metabolism-stimulation,               
              and details of the binding properties of the proteins will be                  
              determined.  The distribution of these, or similar proteins in a               
              variety of tissues will be studied using specific antibodies                   
              generated against the purified components.
