Abstract    :
                   The project will concentrate on electrical impedance                      
              tomography and X-ray tomography.  Electrical impedance tomography              
              is a non invasive method to determine contrasts of conductivity in             
              the human body.  The main goals will be to prove uniqueness in the             
              two dimensional case and to develop efficient reconstruction                   
              algorithms.  The project also includes the anisotropic case of the             
              problem, i.e. the case in which the conductivity depends on                    
              direction.  The aim of this research is to understand the                      
              mechanisms of nonuniqueness as well as to develop reconstruction               
              algorithms.  Also analogous questions for determining the elastic              
              properties of a material by making boundary measurements will be               
              studied.  Problems in X-ray tomography where the integration is                
              performed over a 3-dimensional set of lines will be considered.                
              This work encounters applications not only in medical imagery but              
              also in nondestructive testing of machinery and materials.
