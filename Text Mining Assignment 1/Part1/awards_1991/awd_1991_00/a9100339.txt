Abstract    :
                   This research will model records of seismic activity                      
              incorporating both physical processes, the basis for                           
              deterministic models and stochastic elements.  Then the links                  
              between relevant geophysical variables and appropriate                         
              statistical quantities will be examined.  The objective is to                  
              develop probabilistic models with geophysical interpretations                  
              that can be used to distinguish different kinds of events such as              
              natural earthquakes and nuclear explosions.  Broader goals are to              
              develop and apply the statistics of zero-crossings and higher                  
              order crossings in seismology research.
