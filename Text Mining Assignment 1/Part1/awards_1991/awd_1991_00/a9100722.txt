Abstract    :
              Professor James N. Demas and other members of the Chemistry                    
              Department at the University of Virginia are being supported to                
              conduct a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in                
              Chemistry.  During the summer of 1991, ten undergraduate                       
              students will spend ten weeks actively engaged in a variety of                 
              research projects.  Some of the projects involve environmental                 
              weathering, membrane proteins, organic synthesis and molecular                 
              modeling.  Students will participate in weekly research group                  
              meetings, seminars and field trips, prepare a final written                    
              report, and make an oral presentation at a minisymposium at the                
              end of the program.  Faculty members from each student's home                  
              institution will be invited to the symposium.
