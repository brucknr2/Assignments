Abstract    :
                   This award supports a Research Experience for Undergraduate               
              (REU) Site Proposal to provide research experiences for                        
              selected undergraduates in an interdisciplinary program which                  
              examines the physical and biological functioning of estuarine                  
              ecosystems. It will acquaint the students with the excitement and              
              opportunities of academic research and encourage them to pursue                
              graduate studies and a career in ocean sciences.
