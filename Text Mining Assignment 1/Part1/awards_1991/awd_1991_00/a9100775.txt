Abstract    :
              This U.S.-Morroco collaborative research project involving                     
              Oklahoma State University and Mohammed V Universite is in                      
              the general area of solid state structural chemistry of                        
              inorganic phosphates.  Project funding will allow the team                     
              from Mohammed V Universite to work for various periods of                      
              time in the laboratory of Dr. Elizabeth Holt at Oklahoma                       
              State University and also allow Dr. Holt a research visit to                   
              Mohammed V Universite.  The collaborative research will                        
              focus on the problem of synthesis and characterization of                      
              mixed metal phosphates.  The expected theoretical results                      
              will yield access to single crystal diffraction and emission                   
              equipment for investigators from the laboratory in Morocco                     
              and enhance the expertise of the principal investigator in                     
              dielectric and high temperature synthesis.                                     
                                                                                             
              This project in phosphate structures fulfills the program                      
              objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling                        
              leading experts in the United States and Morocco to combine                    
              complementary talents and pool research resources in areas                     
              of strong mutual interest and competence.
