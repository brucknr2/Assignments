Abstract    :
                   This grant to the University of Notre Dame supports                       
              nuclear physics research on a broad range of topics.  The                      
              primary areas of interest include studies of heavy ion                         
              reactions of importance to nuclear astrophysics, studies of                    
              nuclear energy levels, in particular those levels involving                    
              nuclear superdeformation and very high angular momentum, and                   
              studies of nuclear giant resonances.  The experiments carried                  
              out at Notre Dame will make use of the tandem Van de Graaff                    
              accelerator system.  Other experiments are conducted using                     
              facilities at other laboratories which are appropriate to the                  
              problem being studied.
