Abstract    :
                   The NAS-NRC sponsored Plasma Science Committee will organize              
              a study panel consisting of members with expertise and experience              
              in a wide range of scientific fields, which will address:                      
                   - the health of plasma science in the United States;                      
                   - selected new opportunities for research and application to              
                   technological advances;                                                   
                   - the plasma science community short-term and long-range                  
                   goals; and                                                                
                   - evaluation of these goals in the context of national needs              
                   and broader issues related to the health of the scientific                
                   infrastructure.                                                           
                   The findings of the panel, including recommendations to                   
              federal agencies, will be incorporated as an NRC report, subject               
              to NAS-NRC standards for impartiality and publication.
