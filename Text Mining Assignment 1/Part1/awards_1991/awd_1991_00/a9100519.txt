Abstract    :
              This award provides funds to The Rocky Mountain Biological                     
              Laboratory to support ten undergraduate students for                           
              participation in a Research Experience for Undergraduates Site                 
              Program focusing on field studies of plant reproductive biology.               
              Each student will attend the RMBL for ten weeks.  Guidance will                
              be provided by supervising researchers in scientific design,                   
              project selection and initiation, and project completion.                      
              Students will be encouraged to participate in the many research                
              opportunities available at the RMBL, such as formal and informal               
              seminars, interactions with visiting scientists, and exposure to               
              all levels of a field biology community.  The RMBL is                          
              particularly proud of its success in educating women interested                
              in field biology, and in attracting senior female scientists.                  
              Plans for increasing minority student participation are included               
              in this project.
