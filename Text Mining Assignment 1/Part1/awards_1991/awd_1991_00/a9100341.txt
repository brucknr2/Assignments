Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Machine Translation Summit is the third international meeting              
              for exchange of scientific, technological and user-oriented                    
              information on machine translation.  It is being held for the                  
              first time in the U.S. where there is increasing research                      
              interest in the area.  Further stimulation to the research area                
              will be achieved by including partial support for student                      
              participation through scholarships.                                            
                                                                                             
              This meeting is jointly funded by the DARPA Speech and Language                
              effort.
