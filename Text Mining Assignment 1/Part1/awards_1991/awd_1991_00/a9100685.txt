Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Description:  This project supports the collaboration of                       
              Drs. Robert Boyd, J. H. Eberly, and E. Wolf from the                           
              University of Rochester, and Dr. J. Cooper of the                              
              University of Colorado, with Drs. G.S. Agarwal, S. Dutta                       
              Gupta, S. Ravi, and S.P. Tewari of the University of                           
              Hyderabad in India.  The research will address the                             
              following areas: lasers without population inversion;                          
              stimulated dielectronic radiative recombination; nonlinear                     
              optical phenomena in partially coherent fields;                                
              higher-order nonlinearities in the interaction of radiation                    
              with matter; interaction of atoms with radiation in a                          
              cavity; four-wave mixing lineshape calculations beyond the                     
              impact approximation; and quantum noise in phase                               
              conjugation.  The collaboration will involve three                             
              three-month visits by the Indian scientists to the U.S. and                    
              four one-month visits by the U.S. scientists to India.                         
                                                                                             
              Scope:  The project continues successful collaboration that                    
              started between the two groups several years ago.  This                        
              past collaboration have produced a number of new results in                    
              theoretical quantum optics which are documented in                             
              published papers.  The project is of significant interest                      
              to the U.S. and Indian science, and is well within the                         
              objectives of the U.S.-Indian Cooperative Science Program.                     
              This project is being funded under two grants INT-9100685                      
              to the University of Hyderabad, P.I. Dr. G. S. Agarwal and                     
              INT-9017532 to the University of Rochester, P.I. Dr. Robert
