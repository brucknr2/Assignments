Abstract    :
              This project deals with the design, analysis and implementation                
              of massively parallel algorithms for a broad class of stochastic               
              programming problems.  The developed algorithms will be used to                
              solve models that arise in mortgage-based financing in the                     
              banking industry, asset/liability management for insurance and                 
              pension fund companies, hydroelectric power scheduling and                     
              transportation planning.  The Union Bank of Switzerland is                     
              cosponsoring the project.
