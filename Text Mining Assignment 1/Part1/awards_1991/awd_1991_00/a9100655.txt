Abstract    :
              This proposal deals with the general problem of recovery of                    
              discontinuities in image processing problems such as image                     
              restoration, edge detection, and surface interpolation from sparse             
              depth data. It proposes to use a natural generalization of the                 
              basic Geman and Geman line process to handle arbitrary real-valued             
              directions and magnitudes, and methods such Besag's                            
              pseudo-likelihood methods to estimate parameters.
