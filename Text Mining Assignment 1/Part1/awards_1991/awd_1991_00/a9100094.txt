Abstract    :
              This award will support the development and expansion of a                     
              consortium of universities and corporations for the purpose                    
              of research exchanges with Japan.  In particular the award                     
              will cover the activities leading up to and including a                        
              three-day conference and planning meeting to be held at the                    
              University of Arizona at which representatives of the                          
              participating universities and corporations will meet to                       
              develop detailed agendas for the exchange program.  Japanese                   
              representatives will also attend for one of the three days.                    
              The principal emphasis of the planning conference will be on                   
              defining an effective strategy for expanding American                          
              experiences in Japan.  The important goals of this consortium                  
              are as follows: 1) increasing the number of American scientists                
              and engineers with firsthand experience in Japan through                       
              short-term and long-term research experiences in Japan; 2)                     
              involvement of scientists and engineers from industrial                        
              research labs; 3)access to more technically advanced facilities                
              and equipment in Japan; 4) facilitating the rapid exchange of                  
              students within active research programs; and 5) expanding                     
              the exposure of young researchers to international research                    
              environments.  This program will contribute to U.S. policy                     
              goals of increasing access to Japanese research and development                
              and sending more American researchers to Japan.  It should                     
              also make the decision to go to Japan easier for the individual                
              researcher by providing a matrix of institutional backing and                  
              support so that their visits to Japan are seen as enhancing                    
              to the individuals' careers.
