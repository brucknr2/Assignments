Abstract    :
                   Lempp will pursue research in classical recursion theory.                 
              He plans to concentrate on the question of which structures can                
              be embedded into subclasses of the Turing degrees (in particular               
              the recursively enumerable degrees, intervals thereof, and the                 
              degrees of differences of recursively enumerable sets) in order                
              to study the algebraic structure of these subclasses as well as                
              the decidability of fragments of their first-order theories.                   
              Furthermore, he envisions a new framework for priority arguments               
              similar to the forcing framework in set theory.  Finally, he                   
              plans to study splittings of recursively enumerable sets.                      
                   Recursion theory deals with the theoretical limits of                     
              computability.  It has had a profound effect on how                            
              mathematicians think about the notion of proof as well as other                
              concepts at the core of mathematics.
