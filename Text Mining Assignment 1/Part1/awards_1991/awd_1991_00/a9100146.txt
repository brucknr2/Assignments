Abstract    :
                   Under the Small Business Innovative Research program (Phase               
              I) a new type of polymer construction of high quality planar and               
              channel wave guides has been developed and demonstrated.  The                  
              waveguides make use of the fact that the refractive index profile              
              of the polymer film can be tuned by means of polarization density              
              change induced during wet and dry processing.  Phase II research               
              will be addressed to establishing the technical foundation for                 
              Phase III development of the device:  characterization of the                  
              polymer formation; refinement of the tuning process; refinement                
              of film preparation to demonstrate optimum low resistivity,                    
              proper dielectric property, and high transparency; evaluation of               
              switching speed; environmental tests; optical fiber interfacing;               
              and preparation of a prototype.
