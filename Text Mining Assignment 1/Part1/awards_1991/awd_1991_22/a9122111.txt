Abstract    :
              The Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program in the                     
              Chemistry Division is sponsoring research by Professor Jelski                  
              into the nature of silicon, germanium, and carbon clusters                     
              surrounded by other media.  Prediction of electronic structure,                
              and properties of the clusters embedded in bulk material                       
              simulates realistic experimental situations.  The work makes                   
              use of an Extended Huckel tight-binding model.                                 
              Parameterization of the method by ab initio techniques will                    
              permit the method to be extended to germanium.  The work                       
              involves close collaboration with the research group of Dr.                    
              Rantala in Oulu, Finland.                                                      
              %%%                                                                            
              A very active field of current research, both experimental and                 
              theoretical, deals with small clusters of atoms which have                     
              properties and behavior linking gas-phase molecules, for which                 
              very extensive knowledge is available, to the much more                        
              difficult problem of condensed phase matter.  There are also                   
              potential significance in the production of extremely small                    
              electronic devices.   Professor Jelski is using a                              
              semi-empirical method to study clusters of silicon, germanium,                 
              or carbon atoms in contact with other media, a realistic                       
              situation for practical devices.
