Abstract    :
              This project is a continuation of work on the development of a                 
              world-wide system of national accounts.  The present system by                 
              sponsored by the United Nations is the major source of                         
              standardized empirical information about prices and quantities of              
              the economies of nearly all free standing political subdivisions               
              of the world.  This system of accounts is invaluable for most                  
              kinds of analysis of individual economies, intertemporally and at              
              a given point in time, but by itself does not provide a basis for              
              comparisons across counties.  The major products of this project               
              are two data sets which are directed at making up for this                     
              deficiency.  The first of these is a very large table, "The Penn               
              World Table," which up to now has been presented in five                       
              successive versions.  The second data set consists of finely                   
              detailed and integrated bench mark estimates of price parities                 
              and quantities for 35 summary categories of goods and services                 
              for about 60 countries for the years 1970, 1975, 1980, and 1985.               
                                                                                             
              This project will update the "Penn World Table", by expanding its              
              county coverage, and filling in data gaps. In addition, it will                
              develop estimates of new variables for each country.  The new                  
              variables are of two types: price parities and outputs of                      
              disaggregated components of gross domestic product and new                     
              estimates of purchasing power parities for the production of                   
              outputs by industry.  In addition, the bench mark studies of the               
              United Nations International Comparison Program will be reworked               
              on a data archive of a common vintage and based on a common                    
              methodology.  These updated and expanded data sets are important               
              because they provide the basic information needed for research                 
              aimed at better understanding international trade and economic                 
              development issues.
