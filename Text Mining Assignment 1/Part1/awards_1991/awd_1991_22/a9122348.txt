Abstract    :
              Major emphasis will be on a study of films of 3He-4He mixtures by              
              means of a combination of NMR and third-sound techniques to                    
              elucidate the interactions among the 3He atoms and the energetics              
              of the 3He in the confining 4He environment.  Other studies will               
              include third-sound pulses in collision and the wetting of alkali              
              metal surfaces by helium.
