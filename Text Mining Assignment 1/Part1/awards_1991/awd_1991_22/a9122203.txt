Abstract    :
              The project has two objectives:  one, to organize a United                     
              States-Brazil Workshop on the Technology of Large                              
              Structural Systems to be held in Washington, D.C. by late                      
              1991, to develop the final research agenda for cooperative                     
              research activities between the two countries in this                          
              specific area as agreed upon in the Science and Technology                     
              Initiative signed by both countries in 1988.  Two, to                          
              organize the visits of Brazilian experts in structural                         
              engineering to pertinent U.S. research centers.                                
              Proceedings from these activities will be published and                        
              disseminated to organizations and colleagues interested in                     
              these topics.  The research agenda will identify areas of                      
              concern and opportunity for both Nations and the links                         
              established among experts will benefit all concerned.
