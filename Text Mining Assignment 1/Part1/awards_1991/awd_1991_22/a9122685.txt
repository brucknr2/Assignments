Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Technical Narrative:                                                           
                                                                                             
              This U.S.-Egypt collaborative research project involving Cornell               
              University and Cairo University is in the general area of animal               
              physiology and behavior.  Project funding will enable Mr. Mohammed             
              Matoock of Cairo University the opportunity to work for 3 months in            
              the laboratory of Dr. Katherine Houpt at Cornell University.                   
              Additionally, Dr. Houpt will visit and work at Mr. Matoock's                   
              facilities for a two week period.  Their collaborative research                
              will concentrate on the maternal behavior of Arabian horses.  The              
              main emphasis of the work is concerned with the intensity of                   
              maternal behavior in the immediate post-partum period and maternal             
              attentiveness in the later period of foal development.  Research               
              results could aid in: identifying foal-rejecting mares, developing             
              criteria for foal viability, and determining characteristics that              
              predict optimal growth rates.                                                  
                                                                                             
              This project in behavioral neuroendocrinology fulfills the program             
              objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading                
              experts in the United States and Egypt to combine complementary                
              talents and pool research resources in areas of strong mutual                  
              interest and competence.
