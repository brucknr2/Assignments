Abstract    :
              In this research the principal investigator with collaborators                 
              will study theories of the formation and function of a class of                
              brain structures called brain maps found in the cortex of higher               
              animals.  Brain maps are common in the brains of higher animals                
              and are involved in various computational tasks such as                        
              processing sensory information, and generating motor commands,                 
              and are probably also used in the performance of high-level                    
              functions related to memory and language.  The investigator's                  
              study will focus on brain maps in primary visual areas, with                   
              emphasis on the retinotopic map, and on the orientation and                    
              ocular dominance column substructure of this map.  Specifically                
              the investigator will investigate the relations between the local              
              map structure, intra-cortical connectivity schemes, and the                    
              response properties of single cells.  The comparative aspects of               
              this study will be performed on a massively parallel computer.                 
              This is a timely and important topic, the research is                          
              multidisciplinary in approach, and the state of the field makes                
              this research appropriate for the Small Grants for Exploratory                 
              Research program.
