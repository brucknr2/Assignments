Abstract    :
              Technical Narrative:                                                           
              This U.S.-Turkey collaborative research project involving the                  
              University of Texas and Bogazici University is in the general areas            
              of animal learning and sexual behavior.  Project funding will                  
              enable Dr. Falih Koksal of Bogazici University the opportunity to              
              work for 11 months in the laboratory of Dr. Michael Domjan at the              
              University of Texas.  Their collaborative research will concentrate            
              on the learning mechanisms of sexual behavior in quail.  The main              
              emphasis of the work is concerned with the role of visual cues and             
              context on sexual conditioning.  Research results could expand the             
              present knowledge base of how cue-to-consequence effects influence             
              more complex Pavlovian conditioning.                                           
                                                                                             
              This project in experimental psychology fulfills the program                   
              objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading                
              experts in the United States and Turkey to combine complementary               
              talents and pool research resources in areas of strong mutual                  
              interest and competence.
