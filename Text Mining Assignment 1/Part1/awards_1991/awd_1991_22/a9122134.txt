Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project supports the research of a cultural anthropologist                
              studying small-scale irrigation systems in Spain.  The project                 
              will study systems in the mountains and in the lowlands of Spain,              
              to compare with a previous study of a highland and lowland                     
              irrigation system in Peru.  Using a methodology borrowed from                  
              "expert system" computer models, the project will create a model               
              of small-scale irrigation system management.  Built from specific              
              cases of conflict and management decisions, the model will reveal              
              the underlying values and constraints operating on this case.                  
              The model will then be compared with that fitting the Peruvian                 
              irrigation systems, in order to separate the influences                        
              attributable to altitude from those attributable to cultural                   
              history.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              This research is important because small scale irrigation systems              
              are natural models of resource management that have usually                    
              worked over periods of time.  In a world where there is current                
              concern about global conservation and environmental degradation,               
              this sort of case study of a naturally evolved management system               
              can yield valuable insights to help planners design management                 
              systems for other resource domains.
