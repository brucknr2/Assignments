Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              During omni-directional freezing of a material, a frozen solid                 
              shell forms at the surface, and the volume changes associated                  
              with freezing of the interior causes stresses on the outer                     
              shell. The objectives of this study are to quantify such                       
              thermal stresses developed in a biomaterial during phase                       
              change in the context of food freezing. Mechanical properties                  
              of frozen materials will be measured in a temperature                          
              controlled Instron machine using samples specially prepared to                 
              minimize residual stresses, by freezing from one side. Stress                  
              cracks during typical freezing processes will be observed                      
              under a cryomicroscope. Observed cracking pattern will be                      
              correlated to fracture patterns predicted by a suitable                        
              failure theory. This will be the first quantitative analysis                   
              of thermal stresses in a biomaterial due to large volumetric                   
              changes from phase transformation. Important applications                      
              include not only freezing of biomaterials as in food                           
              processing but also in cryosurgery and cryopreservation of                     
              organs.
