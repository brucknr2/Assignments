Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award provides continuing support for the establishment and               
              operation of the neutron scattering user facility located at NIST              
              in the Cold Neutron Guide Hall.  The project is funded jointly by              
              NSF and NIST.  Instrumentation well suited to the neutron                      
              scattering community will offer a balanced cross section of                    
              advanced neutron scattering instrumentation for high resolution                
              studies of the microstructure and dynamics of virtually all classes            
              of materials.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              Instruments available to users will include a small-angle neutron              
              scattering (SANS) spectrometer with polarized beam capability, and             
              a spin inelastic neutron scattering (SPINS) spectrometer using                 
              supermirror polarizers and a "Drabkin" flipper.  The SPINS                     
              spectrometer can potentially achieve an order of magnitude                     
              improvement in energy resolution over conventional triple-axis                 
              spectrometers, which would open up new opportunities in the study              
              of low energy excitation in condensed matter systems.  The SPINS               
              project is cost-shared equally (50/50) between NSF and NIST.  The              
              SANS instrument is expected to be fully utilized by researchers in             
              condensed matter physics, chemistry, biology and materials science             
              to obtain structural information on a scale size from 1 to nearly              
              500 nanomicrometers, on materials such as polymers, metal alloys,              
              ceramics, porous media structured fluids and gels, biological                  
              macromolecules and magnetic materials that in many cases cannot be             
              obtained by any other techniques.                                              
                                                                                             
              These instruments will provide state-of-the-art capability                     
              unequaled in this country, and will be competitive with the best               
              facilities worldwide.  The instruments will be operated in a user              
              mode.  Proposal review and selection will be by an external Program            
              Advisory Committee, with proposal selection being based on                     
              scientific merit of the projects proposed.//
