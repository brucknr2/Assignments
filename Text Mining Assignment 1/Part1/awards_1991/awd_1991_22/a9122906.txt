Abstract    :
                   This study proposes to examine the placement of the order                 
              Carnivora as well as several other groups, among the eighteen                  
              extant orders of eutherian mammals.  DNA sequence data will be                 
              gathered from four different loci: Cytochrome B, Ubiquitin,                    
              Histone H3, and the oncogene K-ras.  The use of nucleotide                     
              sequence data from several different loci, rather than all the                 
              sequence of one large gene, yields comparisons of codon bias,                  
              rate of evolution, and retention of phylogenetic signal between                
              genes as well as avoiding the evolutionary, peculiarities of any               
              one locus.  Each order will be represented by at least two taxa,               
              which will be chosen to be as diverse as possible based on prior               
              systematic analyses.  A parsimony approach combined with down-                 
              weighting of saturated sites will be used to analyze the data.                 
              Additionally, molecular information will be combined with the                  
              pertinent morphological data in a separate analysis.  This                     
              combination of phylogenetic sampling, use of multiple loci, and                
              total information analysis makes it likely that the so far                     
              equivocal information on relationships of many of the mammalian                
              orders will be better understood and that current theories of                  
              mammalian molecular evolution will be better tested and expanded.
