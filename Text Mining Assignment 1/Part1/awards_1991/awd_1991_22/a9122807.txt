Abstract    :
              This award is for the continued support for the semi-annual                    
              meetings of the Universities Research Conference.  The purpose of              
              this conference is to bring together economists from across the                
              U.S. for two days of discussion on a specific topic of current                 
              interest.  Conference topics are chosen for their relevance to                 
              current economic policy discussions as well as their interest to               
              academic economists.  Recent conferences have focused on monetary              
              policy, trade policy, government spending programs, asset                      
              pricing, exchange rate regimes, fiscal policy, and the economics               
              of the environment.  The next conference scheduled for this                    
              spring will focus on the international comparisons of labor                    
              markets.  Papers for presentation are solicited from over 70                   
              economics departments and 50 business schools.  Conference                     
              organizers are careful to select a mix of established and less                 
              well known researchers.  Discussants and other participants are                
              also chosen to encourage interaction among economists with                     
              similar interests at different universities.  A typical                        
              conference includes 7 to 10 papers and about 80 participants from              
              40 different universities.
