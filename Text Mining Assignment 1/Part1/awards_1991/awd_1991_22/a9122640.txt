Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A primary goal of transfer programs to the non-aged, non-disabled poor         
              in the U.S. is to improve the well-being of children in poor families.         
              In the past, most of the research which has been devoted to the study          
              of these welfare programs focuses on the incentive effects of the              
              programs for parents rather than on the question of whether the parents'       
              participation in such programs measurably benefits children.  Given the        
              large amounts spent on these transfer programs, an assessment of the           
              direct effects of parental participation on children is called for.            
                                                                                             
              This project will examine the relationship between a mother's                  
              participation in AFDC, the Food Stamp Program, and public housing, and         
              various measures of her child's well-being.  These measures will include       
              the child's birth weight, growth, health, and psychological and                
              cognitive test scores.  The study will take advantage of the                   
              availability of a new data set which links a mother's welfare                  
              participation to these measures of her child's well-being: the National        
              Longitudinal survey of Youth Merged Child-Mother File.
