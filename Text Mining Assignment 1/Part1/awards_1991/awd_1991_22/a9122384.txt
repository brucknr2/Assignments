Abstract    :
              The purpose of this research is to analyze the technological                   
              implications of globalization.  Globalization is defined as a two              
              pronged process moving toward the creation of a world-wide                     
              integrated economy.  This process consists of the integration of               
              factor and commodity markets and the international coordination                
              of economic policies necessitated by global environmental                      
              problems, the growing need for product standards, and ever                     
              tighter macroeconomic linkages.  Globalization affects all stages              
              of technological creativity-- initial invention, survival, and                 
              diffusion.  The over arching theme of this project is extremely                
              important because it focuses on the issue of how globalization                 
              might affect the rate of invention, the diversity of new                       
              inventions, their likely survival, and their diffusion.                        
                                                                                             
              The research will first develop evolutionary models of decreasing              
              diversity that draw directly on the growing literature that                    
              recognizes technological change as an evolutionary process.  An                
              historical analysis of the relation between institutions and                   
              technological change suggests that a certain level of inter-                   
              economy competitiveness is essential for the preservation of                   
              technological creativity.  The second part of the project will                 
              analyze the history of technology after 1871 from this point of                
              view.  Third, the project will focus on the political economy of               
              technological progress by describing and analyzing resistance to               
              it, using both historical and simulation techniques.  This                     
              research is likely to suggest that a multitude of competitive                  
              economies is the best guarantee against such resistance.  How                  
              globalization might affect this resistance will also be analyzed.
