Abstract    :
              This project is a study of the composition and properties, as well             
              as the associated synthetic aperture radar (SAR) signatures of warm            
              arctic sea ice.  Direct measurements will be made from US Coast                
              Guard icebreakers in the late summers of 1992 and 1993 in the                  
              Beaufort and Chukchi Seas.  Sea ice characteristics to be                      
              investigated will include thickness, salinity and temperature                  
              profiles, dielectric properties, crystal structure, and surface                
              conditions.  These characteristics will be used to model the                   
              expected microwave backscatter intensities, which will be compared             
              to observed backscatter intensities obtained by the SAR instruments            
              on board the ERS-1 and JERS-1 satellites.  The project will                    
              contribute to an improved understanding of the internal structure              
              of arctic pack ice, of the specific summer properties of warm sea              
              ice, and SAR signature variations produced by differing ice                    
              characteristics.  The information produced by this study is                    
              expected to be particularly valuable in other fields of polar                  
              oceanographic research, such as sea ice dynamics and                           
              thermodynamics, ice mechanics and rheology, oceanic heat and salt              
              fluxes, and sea ice biological processes.
