Abstract    :
                   The goal of this project is to develop an instrument capable              
              of long-term monitoring of volcanic emissions.  Such an instrument             
              could be deployed at strategic locations around an active volcanic             
              site and left unattended for periods of up to six months to monitor            
              important chemical and environmental parameters.  The data would               
              be stored in an internal computer and periodically transmitted to              
              a remote observation station by telemetry.  Unattended deployment              
              of the instrument would greatly reduce the costs and logistical                
              problems associated with repeated visits to remote sites and                   
              volcanologists with near-real-time data on chemical and physical               
              parameters, this technology will be a valuable tool for validating             
              models relating chemical emissions to volcanic activity.  It could             
              ultimately serve as an early warning system for pending eruptions.             
              While this technology does not currently exist, the construction               
              of such an instrument system is possible because of modern                     
              microelectronic capabilities coupled with recent advances in                   
              chemical sensor technology.  This was demonstrated in Phase I of               
              this project.  The objectives of Phase II are the design,                      
              fabrication, optimization, and field testing of prototype                      
              analyzers.  Following extensive environmental testing, the units               
              will be deployed in the field.
