Abstract    :
              Dr. Lynch, working with Ms. Kathleen Jordan, is tracing the                    
              construction and implementation of a new molecular biology                     
              technique as it changes from a highly specialized experimental tool            
              to a commercial product.  The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a             
              technique developed within the past few years for quickly                      
              replicating specific target sequences of DNA.  It is said to be                
              much simpler and less time-consuming than alternative techniques in            
              molecular biology, and it is currently being packaged as an easy-              
              to-use "black box" for sale to medical facilities, forensic labs,              
              and research labs in numerous basic and applied scientific fields.             
              PCR's development has been so rapid that it enables ethnographic               
              methods of study to be used to examine the historical                          
              transformation of an esoteric technique into a standardized and                
              commercialized product.  While sustaining an intensive and present-            
              centered ethnography of a coherent technique, the study aims to                
              attain the kind of broader insight that historical and cross-                  
              institutional comparison can yield.  It thus aims to contribute                
              methodological innovation as well as substantive information to the            
              field of science studies.
