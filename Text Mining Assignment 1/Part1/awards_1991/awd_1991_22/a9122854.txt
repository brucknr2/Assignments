Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Rehabilitation and strengthening of bridge structures have become              
              a major focal point of the Nation's aging bridge inventory.  To                
              mitigate the staggering rehabilitation problem the Bush                        
              Administration is on record "...to be committed to develop a strong            
              transportation research and technology program."  The workshop will            
              address a vital component of the national transportation research              
              program the nation's bridge inventory and will associated ongoing              
              research efforts.  The workshop has three principal objectives,                
              namely (1) to identify the state-of-the-art in bridge design and               
              retrofit research, (2) to develop means of transferring research               
              results to implementable technology and (3) to establish bridge                
              research directions and priorities in support of the nation's                  
              bridge infrastructure for the 21st century.  The workshop is the               
              third in a series of NSF supported Bridge Research in Progress                 
              Workshop and is envisioned to be held in San Diego, California in              
              Fall of 1992.
