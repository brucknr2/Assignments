Abstract    :
                   Correlated fermion dynamics are investigated                              
              theoretically on a partitioned space/time lattice.  The time                   
              evolution of the electronic wavefunctions of atoms in                          
              electromagnetic fields are studied computationally using                       
              massively parallel supercomputers.  Initially the project will                 
              concentrate on exactly soluble model systems in order to                       
              understand how to proceed beyond standard time-dependent                       
              Hartree-Fock theory.  The final phase of the research will use                 
              the knowledge and tools developed in the model study to treat                  
              realistic many-electron atoms and molecules.
