Abstract    :
              The objectives of the proposed research are to provide both a                  
              qualitative and a quantitative evaluation of the different                     
              diffusion testing methods; and to determine the effect of cell                 
              size and test duration on the determination of effective                       
              diffusion coefficients. Comparisons of the measured effective                  
              diffusion coefficients will be made with respect to the type of                
              test, the dimensions of the test cell, and the test duration. The              
              effect of the use of retardation factors determined by both batch              
              equilibrium  and column test methods on the calculated effective               
              diffusion coefficients will also be explored. This research                    
              should have a significant effect on the test procedures used to                
              evaluate the potential for contamination due to diffusive                      
              transport through low-hydraulic conductivity waste containment                 
              barriers.
