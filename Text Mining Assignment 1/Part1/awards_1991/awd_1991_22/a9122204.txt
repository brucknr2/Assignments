Abstract    :
              The objective of this SBIR Phase II project is to design and                   
              build a dynamic camera control system and processing hardware to               
              exercise high performance real time vision algorithms.  High                   
              performance is based on reformulating algorithms in log-polar                  
              image plane coordinates, which significantly reduces pixel count               
              and computations per pixel.  Capabilities of this system will                  
              include depth perception based on binocular stereo and optic flow              
              in dynamic environments.  This system can be duplicated as a                   
              testbed for vision researchers.  The binocular camera motion head              
              will be available as a self-contained module which can be                      
              attached to any processing architecture.                                       
                                                                                             
              Phase I has demonstrated a complete spectrum of image processing               
              algorithms formulated in log-polar coordinates, proving the                    
              feasibility and efficiency of such a system.  Orders-of magnitude              
              reduction in computational requirements suggest dramatic benefits              
              for robot vision in general and mobile robots in particular.                   
                                                                                             
              The proposed technology could improve the cost/performance ration              
              for robot vision systems by several order of magnitude.  This                  
              opens commercial niches unattainable by conventional Cartesian                 
              coordinate based computer vision.  Markets include autonomous                  
              floor cleaners, transporters, security robots, and service                     
              robots.
