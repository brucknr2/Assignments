Abstract    :
              Technical Narrative:                                                           
              This U.S.-Egypt collaborative research project involving the                   
              University of Cincinnati and Cairo University is in the general                
              area of polymer chemistry.  Project funding will enable Dr.                    
              Mohammed A. Sharaf, a highly qualified researcher from Cairo                   
              University, Egypt, to spend approximately two months in the                    
              laboratory of Dr. James E. Mark at the University of Cincinnati.               
              Dr. Mark and two of his research team will visit and work at Dr.               
              Sharaf's laboratory in Cairo for various periods of time.  This                
              collaborative research project will investigate theoretical                    
              approaches in the area of rubberlike elasticity in order to                    
              elucidate the reinforcing effects of fillers in elastomers of                  
              commercial interest.                                                           
                                                                                             
              This project in polymer chemistry fulfills the program objective of            
              advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the              
              United States and Egypt to combine complementary talents and pool              
              research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and                      
              competence.
