Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              It is the aim of this Small Grant for Exploratory Research to                  
              fabricate optical nanofibers and explore their use for optical                 
              sensing and imaging of surfaces.  The fibers are employed in two               
              environmental modes: (1) the tips of cleaved nanofibers are coated             
              with metal films for examining their interaction with aggressive               
              environments through detection by internal reflectometry within the            
              fiber; (2) spectroscopy measurements are carried out with uncoated             
              fiber tips to sample small volumes of gases and liquids near                   
              reactive surfaces.  In the first mode, the optical fibers are used             
              to conduct experiments inside an environmental scanning electron               
              microscope chamber in order to obtain concurrent surface morphology            
              and corrosion reaction rate measurements in a controlled atmosphere            
              (to 20 torr pressure).  In the second mode of operation, the                   
              spectroscopic detection of species near reactive surfaces is sensed            
              in volumes whose size is dependent on the diameter of the fiber and            
              the wavelength of light.  Reactive surfaces themselves will be                 
              imaged to detect submicron heterogeneities and defects.                        
              %%%                                                                            
              This research has the potential to open new fields for optical                 
              sensing and high resolution imaging.  It may be possible as a                  
              result to follow surface chemical interactions in difficult                    
              environments in situ in real time.
