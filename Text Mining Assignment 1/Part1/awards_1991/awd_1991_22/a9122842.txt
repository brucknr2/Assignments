Abstract    :
              This research will focus on the synthesis and metal                            
              complexation of cyclopentadienyl anologs, e.g. 1,2,4-TECp                      
              (1,2,4-triethano bridged bis(cyclopentadienide)),                              
              ofcyclophanes.  Transition metal complexation of the exo                       
              pi-faces of 1,2,4-TECp and analogous compounds will lead to                    
              dimeric, oligomeric and polymeric metallocene containing                       
              materials.  These polymeric columnar metallocenes are                          
              electronically linked via powerful interannular through-space                  
              electronic interactions and are expected to show novel electron                
              transfer properties.

              With this award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting                   
              the research of Dr. Mark L. McLaughlin of the Department of                    
              Chemistry at Louisiana State University.  Professor McLaughlin                 
              will focus his work on the synthesis of cyclopentadienophanes,                 
              compounds having two five-membered rings of carbon atoms                       
              containing two double bonds, with the two rings joined by three                
              side-chains which hold the two rings rigidly near and parallel                 
              to one another.  Above and below each ring sits a                              
              doughnut-shaped electron cloud, and a powerful interaction                     
              between the clouds of the two rings exists because of their                    
              close proximity. These compounds will bind to transition metals                
              to form columnar structures, and the transition metal complexes                
              are likely to exhibit facile electron transfer, and perhaps                    
              also interesting materials properties.
