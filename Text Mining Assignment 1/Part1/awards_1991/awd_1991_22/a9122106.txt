Abstract    :
              In this proposal, we will outline a broad research                             
              plan for the utilization of methods from operator                              
              theory, dilation theory, and interpolation theory to                           
              study a number of issues in robust control and                                 
              nonlinear systems design.  We will be particularly                             
              interested in extending the $H^\infty$ control                                 
              methodology to nonlinear systems in order to find                              
              an applicable nonlinear robust synthesis theory.                               
              We will also discuss further extensions of our to                              
              $\mu$-synthesis as well as distributed $H^\infty$                              
              control.
