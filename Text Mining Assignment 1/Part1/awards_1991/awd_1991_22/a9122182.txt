Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The object of this research is the testing and evaluation of              
              two airborne thermometers (a radiometer and a thermistor) designed             
              to measure temperature in water clouds.  The thermistor is mounted             
              within an aerodynamic housing designed to deflect water drops away             
              from the sensor.  The final design, especially for clouds                      
              containing large quantities of liquid water, will use results from             
              wind tunnel tests and theoretical computations of the airflow in               
              the vicinity of the sensor.  All devices will be tested in the                 
              field using NCAR's King Air research aircraft.
