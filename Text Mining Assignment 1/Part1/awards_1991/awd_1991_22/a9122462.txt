Abstract    :
              The General Social Survey (GSS) and its allied surveys in the                  
              International Social Survey Program (ISSP) gather data on                      
              contemporary American society in order to monitor and explain                  
              trends and constants in attitudes, behaviors, and attributes and               
              examine the structure and functioning of society in general as well            
              as the role played by relevant sub-groups.  These data are also                
              used to compare the United States to other societies in order to               
              place American society in comparative perspective and develop                  
              cross-national models of human society.  Since 1982 the GSS has                
              conducted 19 independent cross-section surveys of the adult                    
              household population of the United States and in 1982 and 1987                 
              carried out oversamples of black Americans.  By collaborating with             
              distinguished social science institutions around the world, the GSS            
              obtains comparable cross-national data that greatly enhance its                
              scientific value at virtually no additional cost.  ISSP currently              
              has 18 participating nations.  Each year 2,000 respondents from the            
              United States are interviewed and about 20,000 respondents from                
              other countries.   The GSS has aptly been described as a "national             
              resource" because it makes high quality data easily accessible to              
              hundreds of social scientists who use the data annually for                    
              research papers and thousands who use the GSS in classrooms.  The              
              GSS is second only to the Census/CPS in its use among sociologists.            
                                                                                             
              This grant renews support for the GSS for five separate in-person              
              cross-sections each with 1,500 cases using a biennial, split sample            
              design in order to substantially reduce costs and still maintain               
              the same scope of the GSS.  In 1993 there will be a GSS with 1,500             
              cases, a core of 60 minutes, a 15 minute standard topical module on            
              culture, and a 15 minute ISSP module on the environment.  In 1994              
              two major innovations are introduced.  First, the traditional core             
              is substantially reduced to allow for the creation of mini-modules,            
              i.e., a block of about 15 minutes devoted to some combination of               
              small to medium size supplements.  Second, the 3,000 case sample               
              will consist of two parallel sub-samples of 1,500 cases each.  The             
              two-subsamples will both contain the identical core.  The A sample             
              will in addition contain a standard topical module, mini-modules,              
              and an ISSP module on women, work and the family.  The B sample                
              will have a second topical module, mini-modules, and an ISSP module            
              on the environment.  The Board and PIs will extensively solicit                
              proposals for the topical and mini-modules from the social science             
              community.  In 1996 the same design described in 1994 will be                  
              repeated.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              The GSS will play an extremely important role in providing data for            
              social scientists to study the human dimensions of global                      
              environmental change.  Information on the attitude of respondents              
              to the environment in the United States and at least the 19 other              
              countries now participating in ISSP will be collected in 1993 and              
              1994.  A group of additional environmental items of interest to the            
              European Community are to be developed by EC members of ISSP to                
              supplement the ISSP environmental module.  Starting in 1994                    
              additional environmental items will be added to the core.  These               
              will be chosen from the ISSP module, the EC supplement and the                 
              extant literature.
