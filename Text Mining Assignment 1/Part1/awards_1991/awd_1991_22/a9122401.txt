Abstract    :
              This project is concerned with dynamic strategies for the so                   
              called Model Generative Reasoning (MGR) architecture that will                 
              enable MGR application programs to cope with both data and                     
              knowledge limitations imposed by unstructured task environments                
              with  greater effectiveness, i.e., task environments in which                  
              problems are typically ill-posed, and data are typically sparse,               
              noisy, and uncertain relevance.
