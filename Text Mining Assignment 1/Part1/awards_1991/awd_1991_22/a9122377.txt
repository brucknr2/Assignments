Abstract    :
                   Professor Macadam studies the dynamics of collisions                      
              between highly excited atomic states and charged (both                         
              positive and negative) ions.  Manipulation of the collisions                   
              environment by applying time varying electric fields, alters                   
              dramatically the outcome of the collision.  Inelastic                          
              processes such as electron capture and detachment reveal                       
              important evidence in a continuing attempt to understand 3-                    
              body collision dynamics.
