Abstract    :
              This project aims to discover computationally practical methods for            
              finding near-optimal solutions to two of the important resource                
              allocation problems faced by an airline: crew planning and fleet               
              assignment.  Crew planning involves finding the minimum cost set               
              of crew round-trips, each beginning and ending at a crew base, that            
              insures exactly one crew on each flight leg that must be flown.                
              Fleet assignment invilves finding the minimum cost assignment of               
              the available aircraft, which are of several different types, to               
              the flight legs that must be flown.  The main technical challenge              
              to be tackled will be that of finding integer solutions to models              
              for which the linear program must be solved by column generation.              
              Success with these two problems would also be easily transferable              
              to similar models in other industries.
