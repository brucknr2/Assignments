Abstract    :
                   Professor Richard's group will continue development of                    
              sensitive new transducers designed to operate with bar                         
              detectors for the search of gravitational radiation.                           
              Assemblies consisting of tuned harmonic oscillators of                         
              decreasing masses attached at the end of a cylindrical bar                     
              antenna are being developed to amplify the small displacements                 
              generated in the antenna by a gravitational signal.                            
                   A very high finesse laser illuminated Fabry-Perot sensor                  
              with power dissipation at the level of a few microwatts or                     
              less is used to detect amplified mechanical displacements.                     
              The sensitivity projected for a three-mode 2400kg A15056                       
              antenna operating at 800Hz and cooled to = 0.03K (such as                      
              planned by two research groups) is at the level of .h = 8.7 x                  
              10-21.  Such a sensitivity would permit observations of                        
              astrophysical significance.
