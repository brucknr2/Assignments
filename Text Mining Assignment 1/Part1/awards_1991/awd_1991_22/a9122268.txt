Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              It is proposed to investigate the enhanced electron-electron                   
              interactions that occur in disordered, two-dimensional                         
              metallic systems.  Electron tunneling, a direct probe of the                   
              interactions, will be employed.                                                
                                                                                             
              Through these studies it is hoped to refine our current                        
              understanding of the metal/insulator transition in disordered                  
              materials.
