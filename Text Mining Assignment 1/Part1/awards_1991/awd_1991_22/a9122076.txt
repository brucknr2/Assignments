Abstract    :
                   The propagation of intense laser light in plasmas is studied              
              theoretically in this US/USSR collaboration.  Of paramount                     
              importance is the investigation of physical conditions in which                
              the electric field large compared to the atomic interactions and               
              where relativistic motions are prominent.  Present theoretical                 
              understanding of this regime is primitive and the computational                
              tools required for the analysis are just beginning to be                       
              developed.  Parallel experimental efforts will allow a direct                  
              comparison of theory and experiment and should result in a                     
              significant advance in our understanding of laser-matter                       
              interactions in ultra-intense fields.
