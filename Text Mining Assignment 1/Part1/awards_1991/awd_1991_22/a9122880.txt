Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              In this project, Dr. L. R. Staronski of the                                    
              Central Laboratory of Optics in Warsaw, Poland,                                
              will cooperate with Dr. Duncan Moore of the                                    
              University of Rochester under the U.S.-Poland

              "GRIN Methods in Conventional Optical Systems:                                 
              Design and Technology."  The researchers will                                  
              apply gradient-index (=GRIN) methods to improve                                
              properties of conventional optical systems, to                                 
              manufacture optical elements or materials whose                                
              index of refraction varies continuously, where                                 
              the changes of the index of refraction are                                     
              designed to compensate for the aberration of                                   
              optical systems and to reduce the number of                                    
              optical components.                                                            
                                                                                             
              This project in optics fulfills the program                                    
              objectives of advancing scientific knowledge by                                
              enabling leading experts in the U.S. and Poland                                
              to combine complementary efforts and                                           
              capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest                                
              and competence on the basis of equality,                                       
              reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.
