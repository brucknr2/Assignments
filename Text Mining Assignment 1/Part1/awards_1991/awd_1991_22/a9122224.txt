              by:  a) refining extreme wind                                                  
              simulation models applicable to a                                              
              well-behaved climate as well as to                                             
              hurricanes and thunderstorms; b)                                               
              developing computer models for                                                 
              microzonation for extreme winds                                                
              (excluding tornadoes) in a selected                                            
              area, the Texas Gulf coast, for

              applications to those regions with                                             
              short-term and fragmentary wind                                                
              data; and c) initiating                                                        
              regionalization of extreme winds in                                            
              the area above mentioned, using                                                
              data collected by the National

              and local agencies, and other                                                  
              sources.  In the process of                                                    
              regionalization of extreme winds,                                              
              homogeneous subregions will be                                                 
              identified and regional extreme

              subregions will thus                                                           
              be obtained.  From these regional                                              
              frequency curves, extreme winds
