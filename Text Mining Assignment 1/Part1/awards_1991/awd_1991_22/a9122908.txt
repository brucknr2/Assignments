Abstract    :
                   Despite general acceptance of the monophyly of the                        
              monocotyledons, there are still questions that remain regarding                
              relationships among the primary lines of evolution.  We propose to             
              bring together evidence from morphology and molecular sequences of             
              rDNA to address this problem.  This, in turn, would provide the                
              appropriate context in which to study genome size, a feature that              
              shows interesting patterns of variation in this group and closely              
              related "dicotyledons".  Phenotypic and ecological correlates of               
              genome size can then be evaluated within this phylogenetic context             
              and their evolutionary significance assessed.  Funds are being                 
              sought for sequencing of rDNA and measurement of genome size using             
              flow cytometry.
