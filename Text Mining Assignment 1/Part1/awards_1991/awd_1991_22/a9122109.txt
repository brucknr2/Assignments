Abstract    :
              In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the                       
              Chemistry Division, Professor Jaan Laane of Texas A. and M.                    
              University will study vibrational potential energy surfaces in                 
              electronically excited states of molecules in a supersonically                 
              cooled jet.  Fluorescence excitation spectra and sensitized                    
              phosphorescence excitation spectra will be recorded for four-,                 
              five-, and six-membered ring compounds as well as for various                  
              carbonyl and aromatic molecules.  A comparison with potential                  
              functions and conformations for ground singlet and excited                     
              singlet and triplet states will be made.  Ab initio                            
              calculations will also be carried out to help provide a better                 
              theoretical basis for understanding the changes resulting from                 
              electronic excitation.

              The study of large-amplitude vibrational motions of non-rigid                  
              molecules provides information about the forces and energies                   
              which govern the conformational changes in these floppy                        
              molecules, that is, the changes from one "stable" structure to                 
              another "stable" structure.  This information can be described                 
              by a mathematical function called a potential energy surface.                  
              Information about the rate at which one structure will convert                 
              to another and back again is also provided by such studies.                    
              This project will gather information about potential energy                    
              surfaces of several types of non-rigid ring molecules,                         
              emphasizing the changes in the surfaces that occur when the                    
              molecule is supplied enough energy to excite an electron to                    
              higher energy states.  Calculations will also be carried out to                
              provide a theoretical basis for understanding the structural                   
              and potential energy changes resulting from electronic                         
              excitation.
