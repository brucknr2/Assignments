Abstract    :
              This project concerns research,                                                
              development, design and                                                        
              implementation of a large-scale                                                
              active control structural system.                                              
              Considerable analytical and                                                    
              experimental works have been carried                                           
              out in active control of civil                                                 
              engineering structures under                                                   
              environmental loads over the past 20                                           
              years, and now the progress is such                                            
              that large-scale implementation is                                             
              feasible.  Full-scale prototype                                                
              systems have been built and tested                                             
              in Japan in recent years, but no

              the-art system of this important new                                           
              technology in the U.S. has been                                                
              developed to date.                                                             
                                                                                             
              The proposed system comprises a 150-                                           
              foot high tower research structure                                             
              to be assembled at the National                                                
              Inventor's Hall of Fame in Akron,                                              
              Ohio.  The tower will be capable of                                            
              dynamic excitations by (i) simulated                                           
              earthquakes, (ii) natural winds, and                                           
              (iii) other types of motions by                                                
              mechanical means.  The design will                                             
              be flexible, permitting the dynamic                                            
              properties and control configuration                                           
              of the tower to be varied for                                                  
              research use, and will incorporate                                             
              features to enable state-of-the-art                                            
              active control techniques to be                                                
              developed and tested.  The project                                             
              will be carried out by a
