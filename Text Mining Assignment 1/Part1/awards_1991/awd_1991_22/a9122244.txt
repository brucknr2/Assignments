Abstract    :
                   The problem to be addressed is:  given N players who each                 
              compete and receive scores in different subsets of M tournaments               
              that are not necessarily equally difficult, find a rating that                 
              represents the quality of each player's performance over the course            
              of a period of time.  By symmetry, ratings of the tournaments'                 
              difficulty are also produced.                                                  
                   The research will develop the theory behind several rating                
              procedures for this problem that have been used in the context of              
              rating professional golfers and airlines' on-time performance,                 
              thereby laying the foundation for applications of greater                      
              substantive import.  Future applications may include problems such             
              as ranking students (i.e., improving on the use of simple GPA's)               
              and performance evaluations (possibly overcoming the perennial                 
              problem of inflation in evaluation scores.                                     
                   There is no one 'correct' rating procedure.  The goal of this             
              research is to describe some reasonable candidates and develop                 
              criteria that help one decide which procedure is best suited to a              
              particular application.  This is analogous to examining properties             
              such as unbiasedness, consistency, and efficiency when choosing                
              from among various possible estimators in statistical problems.
