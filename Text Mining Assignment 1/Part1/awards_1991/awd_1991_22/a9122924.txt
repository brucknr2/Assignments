Abstract    :
              This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER)                               
              will study the development of a finite-difference time-                        
              domain (FDTD) solution for periodic problems in                                
              electromagnetic scattering and radiation.  Such                                
              problems have a number of applications in integrated                           
              optics, scattering, and radiating structures, and the                          
              application of the FDTD method to this class of                                
              problems would allow the treatment of                                          
              inhomogeneities in the geometry, or in the material                            
              constants.  To the PI's knowledge, the FDTD method                             
              has not yet been generalized to periodic structures.                           
              The SGER is appropriate for this work because of                               
              this novelty, and because this work has elements of                            
              risk in that the FDTD technique may not be well-                               
              suited for periodic problems because of                                        
              computational constraints, or the possibility that there                       
              is a presently unforseen difficulty with such a                                
              formulation.  It will allow the PI to quickly evaluate                         
              the concept of an FDTD solution for periodic                                   
              problems by formulating such a solution for two-                               
              dimensional periodic structures.
