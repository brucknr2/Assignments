Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project involves dissertation research by a student of                    
              cultural anthropology from CUNY Hunter College.   The project                  
              will study the production of TV programs in Shanghai in order to               
              understand the media's role in portraying symbols of modern                    
              Chinese culture.  Using ethnographic methods of participant                    
              observation and structured interviewing, as well as textual                    
              analysis, surveys and documentary research, the project will                   
              evaluate how some factors from the West penetrate the cultural                 
              consciousness of Chinese media producers while others are                      
              resisted or transformed.                                                       
                    The study will help us understand how television programs                
              influence local cultural identities with respect to the national               
              center as well as the international cultural centers.  This sort               
              of research is important as transnational influences become more               
              important.  Understanding how local intellectuals function as                  
              cultural brokers while trying to resolve their cultural identity               
              ambiguities between East and West will help members of the two                 
              culture areas deal successfully with each other.
