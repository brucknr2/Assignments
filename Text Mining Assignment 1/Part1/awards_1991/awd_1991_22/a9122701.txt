Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award provides instrumentation and support for a northern                 
              hemisphere survey of the faint interstellar H-alpha (6563                      
              Angstroms) hydrogen recombination line with a high throughput                  
              Fabry-Perot spectrometer.  These observations will provide for the             
              first time a detailed picture of the distribution and kinematics               
              of the warm, ionized component of the diffuse interstellar medium.             
              In many respects this survey of the diffuse ionized hydrogen                   
              through the optical H-alpha line will be analogous to earlier all-             
              sky surveys of the neutral hydrogen made through the radio 21 cm               
              line.  The scientific return should be substantial, since this                 
              ionized gas is a major, but poorly understood component of the                 
              interstellar medium, which has a mass approximately one-third that             
              of the neutral atomic hydrogen and accounts for a large fraction               
              of the interstellar power budget; it also appears to be the                    
              dominant state of interstellar matter in the lower Galactic halo.              
              This survey therefore will have a significant impact on our                    
              understanding of the composition and structure of the interstellar             
              medium and the principal processes of ionization and heating within            
              the Galactic disk and halo.  Furthermore, a survey of this                     
              component is needed for accurate interpretations of sky survey data            
              obtained at radio, microwave, infrared, ultraviolet, and even                  
              gamma-ray wavelengths.
