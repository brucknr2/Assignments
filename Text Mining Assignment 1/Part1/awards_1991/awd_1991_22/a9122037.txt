Abstract    :
                   This grant will continue to support three professors,                     
              four graduate students and a junior postdoctoral fellow in                     
              studies of particle anti particle collisions in two                            
              experiments.  In the first, proton and anti proton collisions                  
              are produced at the Fermilab collider and, in the second,                      
              electron anti electron collisions at the LEP accelerator at                    
              CERN in Geneva, Switzerland.  In both cases, the collisions                    
              are at the highest energies available anywhere in the World,                   
              and make possible the deepest penetrations of the particles                    
              within one another.  This allows the minutest details of                       
              particle interiors to be studied.  These may either conform to                 
              the expectations of the "standard model," which accounts for                   
              most hitherto observed data, or may reveal further, unexpected                 
              phenomena beyond the scope of this model.
