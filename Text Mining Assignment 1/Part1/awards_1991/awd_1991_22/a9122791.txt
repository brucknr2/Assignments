Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This dissertation research project examine how arctic plant                    
              communities may respond to global climate change, and the                      
              consequences that changes in community structure may have for                  
              ecosystem functioning.  Field manipulations of community                       
              structure and temperature, combined with growth chamber                        
              experiments will be used, to determine how the competitive                     
              interactions of the major tussock tundra species change with                   
              increased temperature.  Field transplants of major treeline                    
              species along with seed germination studies will be employed to                
              determine the controls over tree migration into tundra.  The                   
              student will examine how individual species affect system                      
              processes such as productivity, decomposition and nutrient                     
              cycling, and CO2 and CH4 flux, using the previously mentioned                  
              community manipulations, as well as laboratory soil incubations.               
              The Arctic is an appropriate system for this study because the                 
              low number of species allows whole-community manipulations.                    
              Furthermore, dramatic increases in temperature are expected to                 
              occur at high latitudes in the near future.  This study is                     
              significant because it links community structure with ecosystem                
              processes.
