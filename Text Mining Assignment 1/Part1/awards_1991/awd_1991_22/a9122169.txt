Abstract    :
              Research will be performed on five topics in computational geometry, a         
              field concerned with designing efficient algorithms for solving                
              geometric problems.  The first topic includes the problem of finding a         
              way to cut open and unfold a polyhedron so that it flattens without            
              overlap.  The second topic is concerned with understanding the                 
              structure of lines of sight in a cluttered environment.  The third             
              focuses on how to cut up a solid object into as few simple pieces as           
              possible.  The fourth concentrates on reconstruction of (for example)          
              the shape of a tumor from CAT scans.  The final topic includes                 
              studying how a robot hand can grasp securely a complex object.                 
                                                                                             
              Each topic lends itself to exploration by undergraduates.
