Abstract    :
                   This project is concerned with studying the structure of                  
              lattices.  The principal investigator will do this by making use               
              of a construction due to Alan Day; by using varieties of                       
              lattices; and by determining whether every distributive algebraic              
              lattice is the congruence lattice of a lattice.  The principal                 
              investigator will also study the structure of finitely generated               
              free lattices.                                                                 
                   Lattices are discrete mathematical objects with a structure               
              reflecting, to some extent, the structure of set theory or logic.              
              This very weak structure means that lattices can be found in many              
              mathematical environments.  It also means that problems are easy               
              to state, hard to solve and of a very general nature.  The                     
              results of this work will impact many areas of mathematics,                    
              computer science, the social sciences and business management.
