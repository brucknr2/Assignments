Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Over the last decade the fields of laboratory safety,                          
              occupational health, and chemical waste handling have undergone                
              substantial evolution. During the same time period, there have                 
              been significant new regulatory developments, laboratory                       
              standards and additional environmental restrictions on chemical                
              waste handling and atmospheric emissions. In response to these                 
              changes the National Research Council will organize a committee,               
              composed of experienced scientists from academia, industry, and                
              government to prepare an updated report that is responsive to                  
              current knowledge and regulations. This report will encompass the              
              subject content of two original reports, "Prudent Practices for                
              Handling Hazardous Chemicals" and "Prudent Practices for Disposal              
              of Chemicals from Laboratories" and will expand to include new                 
              topics not covered in the earlier reports. The report will be                  
              valuable for all laboratory personnel who handle hazardous                     
              chemicals in laboratories and provide leadership for laboratory                
              safety for the 1990s.
