Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to advance the basic chemistry of                  
              extended porphyrins.  A range of new pyrrole-, furan- and                      
              thiophene-containing macrocycles will be synthesized and                       
              studied.  The compounds will be used to gain insight as to                     
              which structural features (core size, denticity, macrocycle                    
              shape, etc.) most clearly influence intrinsic binding                          
              properties.

              With this award, the Synthetic Organic Program supports the                    
              research of Professor Jonathan L. Sessler of the Department of                 
              Chemistry at the University of Texas, Austin.  Dr. Sessler will                
              focus his work on the synthesis of a class of compounds known                  
              as expanded porphyrins.  These compounds have interesting                      
              potential in the area of host-guest chemistry in that they                     
              contain cavities which can be tailored for the recognition of                  
              and specific binding of cations or anions.  One possible                       
              practical use of the compounds would be in the recovery of                     
              heavy metals from wastewater.
