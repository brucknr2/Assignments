Abstract    :
              This award supports continued theoretical quantum chemical                     
              studies of the dissociative recombination of N2 and the collisional            
              quenching of O+(2D) by O(3P).  The studies of N2  will provide rates           
              and quantum yields of atomic products as a function of ion                     
              vibrational level and electron temperature.  These quantities,                 
              which are difficult if not impossible to measure in the laboratory,            
              will allow for detailed ionospheric modeling of N2  and its                    
              dissociative recombination products.  The results will help to                 
              resolve the long standing discrepancy between measured ionospheric             
              N2 concentrations and the model results.  The complex interaction              
              between the N2 dissociation channels will be handled with a coupled            
              equations approach.  Also, a new dissociative route of                         
              recombination mechanism involving the mixing of dissociation routes            
              of the same symmetry through the electron-ion states will be                   
              treated.  These techniques will also be applied to a study of the              
              dissociative recombination of NO+  in order to determine the total             
              rate and the atomic quantum yields from v=O.  The N(2D) quantum                
              yield from dissociative recombination of NO+ is an important                   
              quantity in many ionospheric models.  The rates for the aeronomic              
              collisional quenching reactions of O+(2D) and O+(2P) by O(3P) have             
              never been calculated theoretically or determined in the                       
              laboratory.  Potential curve calculations will be completed for the            
              quenching of O+(2D) and the cross section and rate will be                     
              calculated by solving the coupled equations.  A similar approach               
              will be used for the quenching of O+(2P).
