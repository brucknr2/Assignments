Abstract    :
              This collaboration between Joseph Birman, City College, and Su                 
              Zhaobin, Institute of Theoretical Physics, Chinese Academy of                  
              Sciences, focuses on developing a better theoretical                           
              understanding of the non-equilibrium transport theory of                       
              microdevices.  This builds on earlier collaboration between                    
              Birman and Su.                                                                 
                                                                                             
              New classes of semiconductor materials, and new types of                       
              heterjunction devices, with novel electronic properties have been              
              produced in recent years.  This has been made possible by                      
              development of sophisticated techniques such as molecular beam                 
              epitaxy and metallorganic chemical vapor deposition which allow                
              new types of engineering, and fabrication of special structures.               
              Resonant tunneling transistors are emerging as some of the most                
              promising electron functional devices, allowing implementation of              
              a large class of circuits with greatly reduced complexity.                     
              Investigation of the properties of these transistors will improve              
              understanding of their potential in development of new devices,                
              and even in development of new computer architectures.
