Abstract    :
                   Intense specialization in all fields of knowledge often                   
              precludes contact by scientists with common interests in                       
              environmental problems.  A traditional vehicle for promoting                   
              cross disciplinary research on important topics is conferences                 
              organized around a specific scientific research theme.  This                   
              project will assemble a group of recognized experts on all                     
              aspects of ecosystem research for the purpose of writing a                     
              comprehensive history of the Chesapeake Bay ecosystem.  The                    
              project will focus on long run ecological change leading to                    
              present day problems facing the ecosystem, including both human                
              and non-human causes of change.  Two conferences will bring                    
              together recognized authorities to exchange ideas and research                 
              findings, and to produce a volume which concentrates of the human              
              and natural forces shaping the Chesapeake ecosystem.                           
                   The approach to this problem is important so that biological              
              scientists across several specialties can assess problems of                   
              natural change, while historians and anthropologists can address               
              the impact of human intervention.  The result should be a                      
              benchmark study for both the Chesapeake Bay  and for other                     
              efforts at comprehending the human and natural forces producing                
              change in large embayments.
