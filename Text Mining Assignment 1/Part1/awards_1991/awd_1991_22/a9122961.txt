Abstract    :
                   A user mode research program will be carried out in                       
              hadronic and electromagnetic nuclear physics.  Data on the                     
              spin response function of the nucleus will be obtained from                    
              polarized proton scattering and reactions.  The nature of the                  
              effective nucleon-nucleon interaction inside nuclei will be                    
              explored.  New multi-nucleon absorption mechanisms will also                   
              be explored, both in pion reactions and in electron                            
              scattering.  The role of the delta resonance will be explored                  
              in all these studies.  Work will be carried out at LAMPF,                      
              Mainz, CEBAF, Saturne (France), and elsewhere.  A nucleon                      
              polarimeter as well as other instrumentation will be developed                 
              at Rutgers, for ultimate use at CEBAF and Mainz.  Grad                         
              students and postdocs will be involved in the instrumentation                  
              development and all other aspects of the research.
