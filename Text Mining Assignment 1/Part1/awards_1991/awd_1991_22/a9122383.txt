Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The projected decline of available scientific personnel in the            
              United States has become an issue of growing concern.  The Task                
              Committee on Undergraduate Science and Engineering Education of the            
              National Science Board has expressed the view that unless the                  
              achievement and participation of women and minorities in                       
              mathematics and science is increased, the nation will be unable to             
              meet its technical and scientific needs.  This proposal seeks to               
              identify institutional characteristics and educational programs                
              that promote the interest and participation of women in mathematics            
              and science.  Specifically, this study examines the effect of such             
              factors on students' experiences and attitudes towards mathematics             
              and science at the middle grades level, a critical developmental               
              period associated with the emergence of gender differences in these            
              fields.  Data analysis will be based on a nationally representative            
              survey of eighth grade students, their teachers, and school                    
              administrators (National Educational Longitudinal Study, 1988), and            
              a recently developed methodology of hierarchical linear modeling               
              will be used to conceptualize new questions about the relationship             
              between educational environments and gender differences in                     
              mathematics and science.  This methodology will permit                         
              identification of between-school variations in such gender                     
              differences and the explanation of these variations as a function              
              of institutional characteristics of schools.                                   
                                                                                             
                   This project, which is jointly supported by the Sociology                 
              Program and the Education and Human Resources Office of Studies,               
              Evaluation and Dissemination, will contribute to the understanding             
              of the role of institutional factors on educational outcomes.  It              
              will also provide information to policy makers who seek to                     
              establish educational environments supportive of female achievement            
              in mathematics and science.
