Abstract    :
              Incorporation of fluorine in organic molecules modifies their                  
              chemical and biological properties.  Many of the available                     
              fluorinating agents are non-specific and/or too difficult to                   
              handle.  One solution to this problem is the use of                            
              fluorine-containing smaller molecules that can act as building                 
              blocks in the synthesis of more complex organic molecules.                     
              Specifically new syntheses of vinyl fluorides from a common                    
              precursor, alpha-fluoro-gamma-substituted allylphosphonate,                    
              will be developed.  This precursor will permit the introduction                
              of fluorine on the olefinic carbon in alpha, beta-unsaturated                  
              carbonyl compounds, and in conjugated dienals.  The initial                    
              introduction of fluorine on the allylphosphonate will be done                  
              using a well-known reagent, diethylaminosulfur trifluoride                     
              (DAST).  The methodology employed will utilize an electrophilic                
              phosphorus reagent as a way to incorporate the phosphonate                     
              moiety in the vinyl fluoride precursor.  This will result in                   
              different substituents around the phosphorus, which in turn                    
              will make it possible to obtain greater stereochemical control                 
              on the fluoroolefin formed by the Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons (HWE)                
              condensation.                                                                  
              %%%                                                                            
              With this award, the Organic Synthesis Program will support the                
              research of Dr. Gerald B. Hammond at the University of                         
              Massachusetts, Dartmouth.  The research will explore the                       
              development of new ways to introduce a fluorine into complex                   
              molecules under non-corrosive conditions.  This should benefit                 
              research in biochemistry and medicine as well as in the                        
              chemical industry.
