Abstract    :
              This award is for support of a three year collaborative program                
              between the University of Colorado, Boulder and the University of              
              Wyoming, Laramie to improve and validate glacier dynamic models.               
              An isothermal, active glacier will be selected and the surface,                
              englacial, and basal velocity field will be determined on a 3-D                
              array of points over the glacier.  These results will be used to               
              test an improved top-down model, to compare top-down and bottom-               
              up models, and to define further the constitutive law and sliding              
              relations.
