Abstract    :
              In this Experimental Physical Chemistry project, funded by the                 
              Chemistry Division, Prof. James Farrar (University of                          
              Rochester) will conduct spectroscopic studies of singly and                    
              doubly charged ions, prepared by a novel laser vaporization                    
              method in clusters with controlled numbers of polar solvent                    
              molecules. Combined with ab initio quantum calculations, these                 
              experiments will reveal specific features of solvent dependent                 
              charge transfer processes.                                                     
              %%%                                                                            
              Clusters, in which a molecule is surrounded by only a few                      
              weakly associated neighbors, represent a unique state of matter                
              with properties between those of gases and liquids. Prof.                      
              Farrar (University of Rochester) has developed a new method of                 
              preparing clusters with an electric charge and a closely                       
              controlled cluster size, and will use lasers to study how the                  
              properties of the cluster change as the number of molecules in                 
              the cluster increases. This will provide a beautifully                         
              detailed, step-by-step picture of how solvents affect                          
              properties of the dissolved material. The results are of                       
              fundamental importance to our understanding of how and why                     
              solvents influence chemical reactivity.
