Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The investigator proposes to pursue two lines of research on which he          
              has done some work.  The first line of research is to investigate the          
              conditions under which the incentive effects of private information are        
              ameliorated by large numbers of economic agents and when markets may           
              perform well in these circumstances.  The second line of research is to        
              develop and analyze methods in which there is an interrelationship             
              between economic decisions and social aspects of an environment.  In           
              such models we may expect rational economic agents to care about their         
              relative position in society.  This concern may result in qualitatively        
              different predictions from those generated from models ignoring these          
              social aspects of the environment.  This project is important because          
              it would improve our understanding concerning how differing conventions        
              for making non-market decisions interact with market decisions.
