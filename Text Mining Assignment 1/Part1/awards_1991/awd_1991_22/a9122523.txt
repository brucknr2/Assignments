Abstract    :
              This project provides partial support for the secretariat of the               
              Council of Managers of National Antarctic Programs (COMNAP).                   
              COMNAP provides for the exchange of information and reports, as                
              well as periodic meetings and workshops among those nations active             
              in the Antarctic.  By facilitating this interaction, COMNAP makes              
              a significant contribution to the effectiveness of support for                 
              research programs in the Antarctic, which address a wide range of              
              polar and global problems.  Typical activities include developing              
              uniform guidelines for environmental documentation and air safety,             
              as well as general meetings were managers can address lessons                  
              learned and upcoming problems within the community of countries                
              working in the Antarctic.
