Abstract    :
              This proposal concerns theoretical and observational studies of                
              the effect of large-scale convection on helioseismic                           
              oscillations.  Over the past few years this work has concentrated              
              on solving the forward problem for the effect of convection on                 
              heliosesmic oscillations and on performing numerical simulations               
              to determine the observable signature of giant-cells.                          
              The theoretical work will concentrate on four areas: (1)                       
              investigating the numerical application of quasi-degenerate                    
              perturbation theory so that the PI can model the heliosesmic                   
              effect of poloidal flows such as banana cells, (2) improving the               
              numerical simulations with particular emphasis on developing a                 
              more realistic simulation of the source time history, (3)                      
              attempting to produce an approximate theory that governs                       
              nonstationary flows, and (4) investigating the application of                  
              asymptotic, ray theoretic, and scattering theories in the hope of              
              illuminating the inverse problem.                                              
              The recently initiated collaboration with Dr. Brown will                       
              concentrate first on developing robust methods by which                        
              individual apparent-m modal line-width measurements can be made.               
              The technique will be optimized to extract the characteristic                  
              signature of giant-cells.
