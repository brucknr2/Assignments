Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Corporations generally must enter the capital markets for                      
              financing to fund their investment projects.  The issuance of                  
              shares to shareholders and the issuance of debt to bondholders                 
              are the two primary sources of financial capital available to                  
              corporations.  Because their claims differ, the interests of                   
              bondholders and shareholders frequently diverge.  For example,                 
              relative to bondholders, shareholders generally prefer higher                  
              dividends, riskier projects, and financing new investment                      
              projects with additional debt.  Bond contracts contain bond                    
              covenants that attempt to mitigate these potential conflicts.                  
              The contribution of this project comes from assembling a unique                
              database on the contractual relations between shareholders and                 
              bondholders.  The data are used to look directly at one of the                 
              most basic corporate relationships, that between shareholders and              
              bondholders.                                                                   
                                                                                             
              Registration statements for bond issues are used to compile a                  
              database detailing the use of restrictive covenants in bond                    
              issues.  The registration statements are for 327 nonconvertible                
              bond issues registered at the Securities and Exchange Commission               
              by 217 utilities and industrial firms during 1989 and an                       
              additional 198 registration statements for the same firms in                   
              1986.  The data will be placed in public archives and made                     
              available to other researchers in this area.  This will be a                   
              significant contribution because previous work has had to rely on              
              financial data sources that provide incomplete summaries of                    
              actual bond covenants.
