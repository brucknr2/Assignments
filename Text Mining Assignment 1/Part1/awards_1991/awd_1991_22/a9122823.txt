Abstract    :
                   Using the polymerase chain reaction, portions of nuclear and              
              mitochondrial ribosomal RNA genes will be sequenced from 41                    
              phrynosomatid species. The sequence data will be combined with data            
              sets based on more traditional characters, and the expanded data               
              set used to infer the phylogenetic relationships among the 10                  
              genera.  Also, from the large number of species of Sceloporus that             
              will be examined, the monophyly of this diverse genus will be                  
              tested and the relationships among the Sceloporus species groups               
              will be determined.  Once a hypothesis of phyrnosomatid                        
              relationships is obtained, questions pertaining to the evolution               
              of various morphological, karyological, and behavioral phenotypes              
              will be addressed.  The status of the morphological characters used            
              in phylogenetic analyses will be reinterpreted and the extent of               
              homoplasy assessed.  Inferences will be made as to whether similar             
              behavioral repertoires are the result of common ancestry or                    
              convergent evolution.  From the molecular phylogeny a better                   
              assessment of the mode and pattern of phrynosomatid karyotypic                 
              evolution will be gained.  The extent of centric fusion and fission            
              within Sceloporus will determined and the homology of particular               
              karyotypes will be tested.  Finally, the sequence data generated               
              will contribute to the growing sequence database for ribosomal RNA             
              genes, allowing better models for the evolution of these genes to              
              be formulated.
