Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Recent developments in politics and economics focus attention on               
              how outcomes are determined by the interaction between                         
              institutional structure and individual preferences.  The projects              
              will endogenize the institutional structure by considering the case            
              in which multiple institutions compete for members.  Examples                  
              include the interaction between the membership and platforms of                
              political parties and the interaction between towns' inhabitants               
              and their provision of local public goods.                                     
                                                                                             
              At an abstract level, institutions take positions based on their               
              membership, while individuals join institutions based on their                 
              preferences.  There is a fundamental interaction between individual            
              preferences, institutional decision-making processes, memberships,             
              and outcomes.  In a political economic equilibrium, no individual              
              wants to change institutional affiliation and each institution's               
              position is consistent with its membership.  This research begins              
              with the question of whether an equilibrium exists.  To answer this            
              apparently simple question requires highly sophisticated reasoning.            
              Conditions for existence will be derived and the potential for non-            
              existence will be shown.  The goal of the research is to improve               
              our understanding of the influence of mobility among competing                 
              institutions in determining political and economic outcomes.
