Abstract    :
              In this project in Experimental Physical Chemistry, sponsored                  
              by the Chemistry division, Prof. Holmes (Arkansas College) will                
              investigate mechanisms by which hydrogen halides are eliminated                
              from organic molecules in the gas phase. The work is important                 
              both for an improved understanding of elimination reactions in                 
              general and because many of the reactions are involved in                      
              destruction of atmospheric ozone. In addition, the work will                   
              provide strong movivation for undergraduate students towards a                 
              career in chemistry.

              Prof. Holmes (Arkansas College) will elucidate and clarify                     
              fundamental reactions of chlorinated molecules in the                          
              atmosphere. An improved understanding of this process is                       
              urgently needed in order to develop effective strategies for                   
              coping with destruction of the ozone layer and for dealing with                
              potential global warming.
