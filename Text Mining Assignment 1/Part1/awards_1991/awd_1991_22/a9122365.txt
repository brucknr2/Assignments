Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This Rigaku x-ray diffraction system with 5-position sample                    
              chamber, high temperature attachement, stress analysis attachment,             
              Debye Scherrer and Laue attachements will be used by faculty                   
              members of the Materials Science and Engineering faculty of the                
              Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, and will also              
              be incorporated as a training unit to introduce undergraduates to              
              materials characterization methods.  Several research projects will            
              benefit from access to this system, including solidification                   
              processing of hybrid materials, creep behavior and substructure in             
              ceramic solid-solution alloys, effect of residual stresses on the              
              fatigue behavior of advanced composties, microstructure                        
              characterization in materials under high-temperature deformation               
              conditions, and structural development in ceramic materials.  There            
              is no x-ray capability at UC-Irvine.
