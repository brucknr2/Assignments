Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A Systematic in-depth investigation of high temperature                        
              superconducting and related materials is proposed.  Based on their             
              established expertise in the discovery, synthesis, and                         
              characterization of materials, they plan to focus their research               
              efforts on three highly related areas:  (1) high temperature                   
              superconductivity under high pressures, (2) the magnetic properties            
              of the superconducting state, and (3) the evolution of high                    
              temperature superconductivity.  By examining the electrical,                   
              magnetic, structural and optical properties of existing high                   
              temperature superconducting materials under pressures in high                  
              fields; by inducing superconductivity in non-superconducting but               
              related compounds under ultra-high pressures; and by synthesizing              
              compounds using special techniques developed by us, invaluable                 
              information will be obtained about the occurrence of high                      
              temperature superconductivity, the physics of magnetic flux                    
              dynamics and the prospect of discovering new high temperature                  
              superconductors.  The study will eventually lead to the development            
              of high temperature superconductivity with a broadened material                
              base and better quality for scientific study and with higher                   
              transition temperatures, greater critical current density, smaller             
              anisotropy, greater mechanical strength, higher chemical stability,            
              and improved ductility for practical applications.
