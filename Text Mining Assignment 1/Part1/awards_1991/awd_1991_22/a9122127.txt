Abstract    :
                   The investigator proposes to study human behavior in dynamic              
              bargaining games with constant costs of delay in complete                      
              information settings.  The predictive validity of the most widely              
              accepted game-theoretic solution to this case -- subgame prefect               
              equilibrium -- will be tested, and it shall be observed in what                
              way, if at all, subjects' behavior systematically violates the                 
              normative solution.  The project is based on preliminary                       
              theoretical and experimental work in this area.                                
                   The investigator plans to enlarge the scope of his previous               
              studies along three dimensions.  The investigator shall compare                
              bargaining with finite vs. infinite horizons, bargaining with or               
              without a quitting move, and bargaining over a deficit vs.                     
              bargaining with a surplus.                                                     
                   These experiments are designed to answer questions regarding              
              fairness, greed, and the robustness of subgame organization in a               
              variety of isomorphic bargaining representations derived from                  
              various task transformations.
