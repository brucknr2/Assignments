Abstract    :
              Poled polymeric thin films are uniquely                                        
              suited for second-order nonlinear optical                                      
              applications of ultrashort pulses (<50 fs)                                     
              since minimal pulse spreading occurs.                                          
              This group has already shown that corona-                                      
              poled nonlinear polymeric films are                                            
              particularly attractive for nonlinear                                          
              ultrashort pulse applications.  The PI                                         
              proposes various sum and difference                                            
              frequency experiments with these thin                                          
              nonlinear polymeric films.  Sum and                                            
              difference frequency nonlinear interactions                                    
              will be used to generate ultrashort UV                                         
              pulses, resulting in the shortest UV pulses                                    
              to date, as well as in synchronized UV and                                     
              infrared pulses.  Additionally, the PI                                         
              proposes ultrashort UV pulse shape                                             
              measurements with a resolution                                                 
              approaching ten femtoseconds.  The                                             
              possibility of anomalous pulse matching in                                     
              the nonlinear polymeric films will be                                          
              investigated.  Terahertz beam generation                                       
              by optical rectification is also proposed.                                     
              Some of the proposed experiments will be                                       
              carried out in cooperation with Dr. C.V.
