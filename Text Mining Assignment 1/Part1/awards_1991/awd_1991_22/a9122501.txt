Abstract    :
              Geosynthetic materials, such as geomembranes, geotextiles and                  
              geonets have been extensively used for hazardous waste                         
              containment for the last ten years. One problem facing the                     
              advancement of modern geosynthetic technology is the lack of                   
              consistent testing methods. The objectives of this research are                
              to develop a technical method to evaluate long-term chemical                   
              compatibility and durability; study chemical structure-mass                    
              transport relationships; evaluate compatibility, durability and                
              permeation potential; investigate effects of mechanical stress                 
              and pressure on the mass transport of hazardous wastes through                 
              geomembranes; and develop a mathematical model to predict the                  
              mass flux of organic chemicals through geomembranes.
