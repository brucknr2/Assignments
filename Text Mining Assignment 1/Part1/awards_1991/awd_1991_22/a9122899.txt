Abstract    :
              The primary objective of this project is to investigate both                   
              interspecific and intraspecific variation in the Drosophila                    
              willistoni group, through analysis of structural and DNA sequence              
              polymorphism in the Alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) gene.  Specific                
              aims of this study are 1) to analyze structural polymorphism at the            
              Adh locus of the willistoni group by assaying for the                          
              presence/absence of the third intron of the Adh gene 2) determine              
              the degree of DNA sequence polymorphism in the Adh gene among                  
              species of the willistoni group and within D. willistoni 3) to                 
              derive a phylogeny of the willistoni group and the subgenus                    
              Sophophora using DNA sequence data and 4) to analyze the degree of             
              inter- and intraspecific codon usage bias for Adh in the willistoni            
              group.  The codon usage analysis will aim at determining 1) if the             
              level of codon usage bias varies among species of the willistoni               
              group and/or within D. willistoni 2 if rate of synonymous                      
              substitution is constrained by codon usage bias and 3) if there is             
              a preference for a particular base at the third position of codons.            
              This study uses molecular population genetics and evolutionary                 
              genetics of the Adh locus to examine evolutionary patterns in the              
              D. willistoni group, and will further our understanding of                     
              evolution at the molecular level.
