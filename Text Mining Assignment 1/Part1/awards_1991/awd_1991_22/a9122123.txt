Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The objective of the present work is to develop a fundamental                  
              knowledge base for microscale dropwise melt deposition, and to                 
              explore possible applications and equipment design for those                   
              applications.  A variety of modes of controlled microdrop                      
              deposition will be investigated, followed by detailed                          
              quantitative studies aimed at identifying the controlling                      
              thermo-physical processes and the parameters that determine                    
              satisfactory deposition in each mode.  These studies will be                   
              made using microdrops of  various waxes in a test system which                 
              is capable of generating very reproducible droplets at various                 
              melt temperatures and droplet deposition speeds over a broad                   
              range of deposition frequencies.  Although these                               
              investigations use waxes, one of the main objectives of the                    
              program will be to develop scaling laws for the various                        
              deposition modes, and possibly also some useful analytical                     
              models based on simplified models of the thermo-physical                       
              solidification processes that are involved.  This will lead to                 
              an understanding of how the data for wax extrapolates to other                 
              melt materials.  Some tests will also be made with low melting                 
              point metals like tin as a check on the proposed scaling laws                  
              derived from analysis and data on waves.                                       
                                                                                             
              The buildup of materials or physical objects by controlled                     
              deposition of melt microdrops has potential applications in                    
              rapid prototyping, 3D copying, direct fabrication of small                     
              structures including electronics packaging and materials                       
              processing.
