Abstract    :
              Recent problems with the savings and loan industry are                         
              reminiscent of four other American mortgage market crises between              
              1830 and 1940.  Each episode was accompanied by severe                         
              macroeconomic dislocation, and was intimately connected to                     
              innovations or modifications of existing lending arrangements.                 
              This project is designed to investigate one of these episodes,                 
              the mortgage boom of the 1800s and the bust of the 1890s.  Two                 
              innovations were introduced in the 1870s to stimulate the flow of              
              mortgage funds from the Northeast to the agricultural frontier:                
              western mortgage banks, and mortgage lending by eastern life                   
              insurance companies.  The volume of lending through both channels              
              increased rapidly for two decades.  But nearly all of the western              
              mortgage banks collapsed when the western land boom ended in the               
              early 1890s, while the mortgage investments of the life insurance              
              companies continued to perform satisfactorily.  The goal of this               
              project is to explain why the performance of these two                         
              innovations was so different.  This research is important because              
              it will provide a better understanding of why institutional                    
              innovations in the mortgage market have been so fragile                        
              throughout the history of American economic development.                       
                                                                                             
              The most appealing explanations for the failure of nineteenth                  
              century mortgage banks emphasize that informational asymmetries                
              are inherent in institutional mortgage lending.  However, these                
              hypotheses have yet to be tested because information on                        
              individual mortgage contracts is not easily attained.  The data                
              base to be assembled will contain detailed information on more                 
              than 70,000 mortgages made by the Aetna Life Insurance Company,                
              and a Kansas mortgage bank (the J. B. Watkins Company) in eight                
              western states.  These were two of the most important                          
              institutional lenders operating in the western farm mortgage                   
              market between 1870 and 1900.  These data will be used to examine              
              whether differences in the design of contracts and lending                     
              practices explain why institutions such as the Watkins Company                 
              failed, while insurance companies were having little trouble with              
              their mortgage portfolios.  Other scholars will also find this                 
              data set useful for addressing a broad range of economic, social,              
              and political issues connected to nineteenth-century western farm              
              settlement and mortgage making.
