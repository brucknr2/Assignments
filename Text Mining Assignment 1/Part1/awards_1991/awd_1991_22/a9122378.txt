Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will be used to support the organization of the eleventh            
              Santa Cruz Summer Workshop in Astronomy and Astrophysics to be held            
              13-16 July 1992.  The title of the workshop is to be "The Globular             
              Cluster--Galaxy Connection: Globular Clusters Within the Context               
              of their Parent Galaxies".  The theme of the workshop will be to               
              interpret the properties of globular cluster systems in the Milky              
              Way and other galaxies within the context of the formation and                 
              evolution processes of both the clusters themselves and their                  
              parent galaxies.
