Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              There is much debate in political science literature about whether             
              the rise of global financial markets is socially beneficial or                 
              harmful.  Unnoticed in this debate is the impact which                         
              international financial transactions may have on democratic                    
              institutions.  For example, do international financial flows                   
              prevent citizens from altering the content and especially the                  
              effects of fiscal and monetary policies through elections?  This               
              research investigation addresses this question by assessing how the            
              workings of the global financial system affects and is affected by             
              specific features of electoral institutions.  The investigator will            
              attend to this question through the construction and analysis of               
              theoretically grounded, mathematical and statistical models of                 
              financially open democratic systems. This project should enhance               
              our understanding of the emerging global financial system by                   
              employing a more systematic and sound approach to the topic than               
              has previously existed.
