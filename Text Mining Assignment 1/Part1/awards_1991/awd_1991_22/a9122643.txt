Abstract    :
              Ever since November and December of 1942, when survey teams                    
              identified Los Alamos, New Mexico and Hanford, Washington as new               
              sites for two key components of the Manhattan Project, the West has            
              been valued by America's atomic programs for its remoteness, its               
              supposed emptiness, and its natural resources.  Although western               
              states had become wary of involvement with the nuclear industry by             
              the 1980's, for much of the period after 1942 they welcomed their              
              association with the production of atomic energy and weapons                   
              because it hastened their growth.  The Federal government spent                
              billions of dollars on western laboratories and towns, production              
              and assembly facilities, and test sites.  It brought more                      
              scientific and cultural sophistication to a region that had been               
              regarded as relatively backward in cultural terms, and it gave some            
              Westerners a greater sense of belonging by seemingly incorporating             
              them more closely into a national purpose.                                     
                                                                                             
              In order to examine the history of the atomic industry in the West,            
              Drs. Findlay and Hevly are organizing a scholarly meeting, "The                
              Atomic West:  Federal Power and Regional Development" to be held               
              25-27 September 1992 in Seattle.  The conference's goal is to bring            
              historians of science and technology together with historians of               
              the American West, along with other scholars, in order to stimulate            
              a consideration of the regional context in studies of the                      
              Federally-sponsored development of nuclear technology.  This                   
              conference will help historians of science and technology situate              
              their work in the social, political and environmental contexts of              
              the West, and encourage historians of he West to integrate an                  
              understanding of history of science into regional history.  Public             
              and educational outreach are also part of this conference.
