Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Under a Small Grant for Exploratory Research, an investigation                 
              will be conducted of species separation in a binary mixture.                   
              The species are smoke and air. Unusually rapid separation of                   
              smoke particles was observed in preliminary experiments in a                   
              vortex flow designed to study vortex breakdown. The process                    
              was much too rapid to be due to centrifugal separation, and is                 
              not explainable with conventional mechanisms. A further                        
              systematic exploration of the phenomenon, together with                        
              numerical particle path simulations, is to be carried out.                     
                                                                                             
              A new mechanism for rapid species separation would be highly                   
              useful in separations technology for a broad range of                          
              engineering systems.
