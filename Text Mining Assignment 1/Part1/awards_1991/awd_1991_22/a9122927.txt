Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The oceanographic instrumentation program supports requests to                 
              acquire instrumentation for the collection, processing and analysis            
              of oceanographic data.  This proposal from the University of Oregon            
              requests funding for equipment that will be used to support NSF-               
              funded research cruises aboard the R/V WECOMA, a 177 foot vessel               
              that is owned by NSF and operated by the University.
