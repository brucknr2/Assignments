Abstract    :
              This research grant, funded by the Divisions of Materials Research             
              and Chemistry, is aimed at providing a description of polymer                  
              solutions and blends which has a solid basis in statistical                    
              mechanics, yet is accessible to experimentalists for understanding             
              current results and designing future work.  The research involves              
              developing a theoretical description of these systems using                    
              integral equation techniques where the goal is to understand                   
              equilibrium properties, especially those concerned with                        
              miscibility.  Progress has already been made using a lattice model             
              to describe a binary incompressible mixture and a compressible pure            
              fluid.  New research will be done in two areas: further development            
              of the lattice model and extension of this treatment to a continuum            
              model. The lattice model, which can be solved analytically, can be             
              checked against simulation results, almost all of which are done on            
              lattice solutions.  The continuum model is closer to reality, but              
              analytic solutions are not possible.                                           
              %%%                                                                            
              Calculations will be done to describe the properties of liquid                 
              polymers and their mixtures.  The models will be based on                      
              statistical mechanics results for liquids and complement other                 
              models describing these material systems.  The results will be                 
              important in interpreting experimental results and for designing               
              new materials.
