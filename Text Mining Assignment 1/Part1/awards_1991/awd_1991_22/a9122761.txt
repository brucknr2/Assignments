Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is the synthetic potential inherent                 
              in catalysis by transition metal complexes.  Allyl systems                     
              involving Pd, Mo, Ni and W will be manipulated to obtain                       
              chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantioselective                               
              transformations.  Among the other topics to be investigated in                 
              the project are: Intramolecular carbametallation, metal                        
              catalyzed proton shifts leading to reactive intermediates that                 
              can undergo prototropic cycloisomerization, bifunctional                       
              reagents including organosulfur intermediates, and the design                  
              of composite functional groups.  The theme of developing                       
              reactions that minimize chemical waste pervades every aspect                   
              ofthe work.                                                                    
              %%%                                                                            
              With this Accomplishment Based Renewal award, the Synthetic                    
              Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr. Barry M.                     
              Trost of the Department of Chemistry at Stanford University.                   
              Professor Trost will focus his work on developing efficient                    
              synthetic approaches to complex organic molecules of                           
              theoretical and biological interest while increasing "atom                     
              economy".  The use of catalytic amounts of transition metal                    
              complexes is stressed in the work.
