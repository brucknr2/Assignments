Abstract    :
                   This award is for the purchase of a Datacube MaxVideo 20                  
              Image Processing System and two Sun SPARCstations each with                    
              an image database server.  This equipment will support                         
              research in image understanding and image compression for                      
              dynamic scences.                                                               
                                                                                             
              Research in image understanding and image compression                          
              requires high computational power and large memory space.                      
              The University of Central Florida will purchase equipment to                   
              build a real-time vision system to support several research                    
              projects in image understanding and image compression for                      
              dynamic scenes.
