Abstract    :
              Moment resisting R/C frames are the                                            
              most common type of structural                                                 
              system used for low to moderate                                                
              rise structures in regions of high                                             
              seismic risk.  If properly designed                                            
              and detailed they are very ductile                                             
              systems capable of enduring the

              motions.  At least two common                                                  
              connection problems have not been                                              
              adequately researched, namely wide                                             
              beam connections and eccentric beam                                            
              connections.  Due to the lack of                                               
              experimental studies for these two                                             
              special cases, conflicting design                                              
              recommendations have been                                                      
              developed.  Wide beam connections                                              
              are permitted by ACI Committee 318                                             
              in seismic zones.  However, citing                                             
              the lack of research, Committee 352                                            
              does not allow the use of wide beam                                            
              connections in seismic zones.                                                  
                                                                                             
              The goal of this research study                                                
              will be to generate information

              special connections under large
