Abstract    :
              This doctoral dissertation research examines organizational culture            
              from the property rights perspective and aims to develop and                   
              empirically test a framework that predicts the relationship between            
              contextual constraints and the emergent control systems in the                 
              organization on the one hand, and the influence of these                       
              constraints and controls on group norms within the organization,               
              on the other.  The scope of this study is limited to the                       
              verification of                                                                
              (a) the relationship between contextual constraints and property               
                  rights at the individual level,                                            
              (b) the relationship between constraints, rights and ``within                  
                  group'' norms.
