Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Research will be conducted to elucidate basic mechanisms and                   
              evolution of acoustic communication, using treefrogs as a model                
              system.  These animals produce stereotyped vocalizations and                   
              respond selectively to playbacks of synthetic signals that                     
              contain features that carry information about the species and                  
              quality of a potential mate.                                                   
                                                                                             
              The goals of this project are: (1) to quantify the degree of                   
              selectivity of female treefrogs in the presence and in the                     
              absence of a closely-related species with similar calls; (2) to                
              determine the extent to which females avoid a nearby sound source              
              that emits calls of another species in order to reach a distant                
              source of attractive calls of the same species; and (3) to                     
              determine if artificially-induced changes in chromosome number                 
              affect key features of the calls of males and the selectivity of               
              females for those key features.  The last study is aimed at                    
              learning if the natural difference in chromosome number in two                 
              species of gray treefrogs is responsible, at least in part, for                
              differences in their communication systems.                                    
                                                                                             
              The acoustic communication of treefrogs is easier to study than                
              that of many other kinds of animals, but the general principles                
              that emerge from Dr. Gerhardt's research will contribute to                    
              growing scientific understanding of communication systems and how              
              they work in reproduction and survival of a wide range of diverse              
              species.  Such understanding is valuable for control of pest                   
              species as well as for protection of endangered or economically                
              valuable species.
