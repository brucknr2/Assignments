Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program                 
              will help the Department of Chemistry at Bucknell University,                  
              an undergraduate institution, acquire a 300 MHz NMR                            
              spectrometer which will be used in research investigations in                  
              the following areas of chemistry:  synthesis of cannabionoids                  
              and analogs, asymmetric cycloalkenone synthesis, cycloadditions                
              of heterodienes, organometallic chemistry, cycloaddition                       
              reactions of o-quinone monimides with heterocyclic systems, and                
              preparation of inhibitors of lipoxygenase.                                     
                                                                                             
              Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy is the most                      
              powerful tool available to the chemist for the elucidation of                  
              the structure of molecules.  It is used to identify unknown                    
              substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within                 
              molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between                   
              molecules in solution.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR                         
              spectroscopy is essential to chemists who are carrying out                     
              frontier research.  The results from these NMR studies are                     
              useful in areas such as polymers and catalysis, and in biology.
