Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              It is proposed to continue research on the Giant Magnetoresistance             
              (GMR) in multilayers of a ferromagnetic (F) and a nonmagnetic (N)              
              metal; and interface and multilayer resistances involving F metals,            
              N metals and superconductors.
