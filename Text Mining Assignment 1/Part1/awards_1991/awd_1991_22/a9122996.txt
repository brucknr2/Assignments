Abstract    :
              The history of artificial intelligence has been marked by a                    
              continuing specialization and diversification of its areas of                  
              research.  At times, some sort of reaction to developments is                  
              needed, one in which theorists can step back and consider the                  
              implications of theories in subareas of artificial intelligence                
              that are potentially important to the development of integrated                
              systems.   All areas of artificial intelligence, such a natural                
              language understanding and computer vision, have made significant              
              progress, but the field lacks a high level of integration.  The                
              goal of this workshop is to bring together top-level researchers               
              form both the US and Japan to explore potential development of an              
              integrated in multi-media environments, as well as to promote                  
              better understanding and cooperation on this problem between the               
              two countries.//
