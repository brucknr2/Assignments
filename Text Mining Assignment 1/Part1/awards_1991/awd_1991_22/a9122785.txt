Abstract    :
              Solid waste disposal is becoming increasingly expensive in terms               
              of landfill and labor costs as well as environmental costs.  Yet,              
              most residents pay no additional cost per unit of trash put out                
              for collection, and thus view disposal as free.  An alternative                
              approach would rely instead on prices as an incentive to recycle               
              waste.  The purpose of this project is to develop both an                      
              analytical model and empirical analysis for analyzing the joint                
              problem of charging a direct fee for garbage collection to                     
              encourage recycling and at the same time avoiding improper                     
              disposal methods such as illegal burning and dumping.  This                    
              research is important because it will shed light on the issues                 
              related to pricing incentives for the recycling of solid wastes.               
                                                                                             
              Expressions will be derived for the optimal price per unit of                  
              garbage collection as a function of the city's cost of landfill                
              disposal, additional environmental costs, the value of recycling,              
              and the extent to which residents respond with illegal dumping.                
              The empirical approach involves collecting data directly from 160              
              cities, over half of which have recently instituted per unit                   
              trash collection fees.  These new data will be combined with                   
              census data to estimate the demand for trash collection services               
              as a function of its price, household income and other                         
              characteristics, the availability of curbside recycling                        
              collection, and other variables.
