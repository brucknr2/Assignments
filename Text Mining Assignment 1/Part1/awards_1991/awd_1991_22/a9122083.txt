Abstract    :
              This project is designed to study the socio-religious history of               
              the Yup'ik Eskimos of Sivuqaq (St. Lawrence Island, Alaska). The               
              goal is to study present religious systems and the socio-religious             
              changes which took place following the introduction of Christianity            
              in the 1900s. Ethnographical, ethnohistorical, oralhistorical and              
              contemporary oral data will be used to construct an ethnographic               
              narrative based on native perspectives, the so-called emic                     
              perspective. The study draws theoretically and methodologically on             
              the relationship of the anthropologist to human subjects, and the              
              participation of Native people in the research process.
