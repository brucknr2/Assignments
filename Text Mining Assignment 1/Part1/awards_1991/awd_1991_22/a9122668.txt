Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The oceanographic instrumentation program supports requests to                 
              acquire instrumentation for the collection, processing and analysis            
              of oceanographic data.  This proposal from SUNY Stonybrook requests            
              funding for a 1200 kHz, broadband Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler            
              (ADCP) to support research in shallow coastal waters and estuaries.            
              The instrument is currently needed to support NSF-funded studies of            
              mixing and hydraulic control in the Hudson River estuary and an                
              investigation currents on coral reefs of Barbados.  The instrument             
              will also be made available to researchers at other universities               
              and managed as a shared-use facility.  SUNY will provide cost-                 
              sharing for this purchase.
