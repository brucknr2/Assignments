Abstract    :
                   This award is in support of one element of the PALE activity              
              (Paleoclimates from Arctic Lakes and Estuaries).  Research is                  
              focused on a lake coring program in the Eastern Canadian Arctic                
              with the goal of recovering continuous records of environmental                
              change for the last 10 to 15 thousand years.  Baffin Island lies               
              in a key location and analyses of climatic data indicate that                  
              this region serves as a bellwether for the circum-arctic climate               
              system.   This project will reconstruct past climates from down-               
              core changes in the pollen and diatom assemblages, stable                      
              isotopic ratios and physical characteristic of the sediment in                 
              cores.                                                                         
                   The lakes will be strategically located along a N/S                       
              temperature transect, and across the E/W marine/continental                    
              climate gradient.  Cores form these lakes will allow examination               
              of  questions related to climate change, including regional                    
              glacial history (timing and extent of the last continental ice                 
              advance and the pattern of deglaciation), sea level change (both               
              postglacial emergence and the more recent submergence), and                    
              renewed development of cirque and mountain glaciers in the late                
              Holocene (Neoglaciation).  Sampling will be undertaken with a                  
              density commensurate with PALE objectives, i.e. decadal to                     
              centuries resolution depending on the accumulation rates within                
              the different lake basins.
