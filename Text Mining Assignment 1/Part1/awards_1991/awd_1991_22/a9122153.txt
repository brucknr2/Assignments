Abstract    :
                   This research addresses primarily the air-sea interaction                 
              problem from a GCM perspective.  The focus is on two major                     
              issues:  1) Variability of the Atlantic climate, including the                 
              sensitivity of the atmospheric circulation to sea surface                      
              temperature (SST) anomalies, inter-basin relations of SST                      
              anomalies, and feedbacks on the ocean of the altered atmospheric               
              circulation, and 2) The impact of improved parameterizations of                
              clouds processes and cloud amount on modeling water vapor                      
              feedback in the atmospheric response to change in SST of the type              
              expected due to increased concentration of greenhouse gases.                   
                                                                                             
                   The approach for investigation is based on numerical                      
              experimentation with the UCLA atmospheric general circulation                  
              model (AGCM).                                                                  
                                                                                             
                   This research is important because it seeks to give a                     
              predictive understanding of the most important processes                       
              affecting climate variability and change.
