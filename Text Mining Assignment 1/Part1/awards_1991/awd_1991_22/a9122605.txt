Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This research is intended to demonstrate that climate dynamics            
              understanding and climate predictability can be advanced from the              
              study of long time series of atmospheric climate variables.                    
              Complementary microscopic and macroscopic approaches are to be                 
              pursued.  In the former, the methods of modern non-linear dynamics             
              will be applied to highly-sampled observations to investigate the              
              limits of short-term predictability.  In the macroscopic method,               
              the classical methods of statistical mechanics will be applied to              
              slowly-changing climatic variables.  Both approaches potentially               
              lead to quantitative estimates of the sensitivity of simulated or              
              observed climates to small perturbations.  A program of developing,            
              testing, and applying these methods to a sequence of increasingly              
              sophisticated models and to data is included under this grant.  The            
              research will involve the training of undergraduate and graduate               
              students and postdoctoral fellows.                                             
                                                                                             
                   This request is important because it examines alternative and             
              potentially fruitful alternative approaches to modeling and                    
              predicting the climate system.
