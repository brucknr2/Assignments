Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              There are three parts to this study of economic growth and the                 
              level of economic aggregates.   The first part focuses on adverse              
              selection and aggregate employment.  Preliminary work by the                   
              investigator suggests that market participation will be                        
              inefficient in an economy in which it is costly to distinguish                 
              between low and high quality workers.  The project develops a                  
              general theory of market participation based on two different                  
              strands of theoretical research: imperfectly coordinated trading               
              and strategic complementarities in production.  The theory is                  
              extended to allow people to improve their jobs over time, to                   
              permit organizations such as firms to play a coordinating role,                
              and to reflect different sectoral locations within markets.  The               
              importance of this inefficiency will be quantified and measured                
              empirically.                                                                   
                                                                                             
              The second part develops a growth theory in which learning is the              
              engine of growth.  Information theory is used to derive the                    
              properties of the relationship between learning, technology and                
              economic growth.  The third part explores the idea that a society              
              well-endowed with general skills will more easily take advantage               
              of new technologies by learning them faster.  Skilled labor will               
              concentrate on new technologies, a result consistent with                      
              arguments in the old-product cycle literature.
