Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project employs a model of spatial differentiation to                     
              analyze the modern transformation of three agrarian societies  -               
              France, Japan, and China -- during comparable spans of                         
              "development time" (1760-1896 for France, 1800-1926 for Japan,                 
              and 1842-1990 for China).  The research team, an anthropologist,               
              a geographer, a demographer, and an historian, will follow a                   
              comparative research design to advance our knowledge of an                     
              important interdisciplinary issue: the interaction between                     
              population processes and economic development in space and time.               
              Using disaggregated quantitative data and regional systems                     
              methodology, the researchers will complete an analysis of each                 
              country's regional structure, conceptualized as a hierarchy of                 
              central places and of their internally differentiated                          
              hinterlands, and proceed to test propositions concerning                       
              population and development.  Then, in three comparable subregions              
              (centered on Bordeaux, Nagoya, and Ningbo) they will replicate                 
              the analysis at lower levels of the hierarchy and pursue                       
              longitudinal studies, tracing the diffusion of modern innovations              
              downward through the spatial hierarchy.  In selected local                     
              systems within each of the targeted subregions, they will use the              
              methods of historical ethnography to extend the analysis to the                
              village level.                                                                 
                                                                                             
              The project is expected to demonstrate the analytical power of                 
              the regional systems model, revealing its utility for a wide                   
              range of research in the social sciences.
