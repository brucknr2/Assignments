Abstract    :
              Plans to reduce the number of military personnel by 25% have                   
              stimulated public interest in the social representativeness for                
              the U.S. military and in the effects of voluntary military                     
              service on civilian labor market outcomes.   The military is the               
              largest single employer of young people and veterans benefits                  
              constitute the largest federal subsidy to education and training.              
              The purpose of this project is to analyze the impact of military               
              service on the earnings of veterans after leaving the military.                
              What is at issue is whether or not military service, on average,               
              has a positive or negative effect on success in the civilian                   
              labor market.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              Errors in the scoring of military entrance examinations in the                 
              late 1970's increased the probability that low ability applicants              
              would be accepted.  This exogenous shift in acceptance                         
              probabilities provides a natural experiment that can be used to                
              estimate the effects of voluntary, military service on civilian                
              labor-market outcomes.  The effects of military entrance                       
              standards on the social composition of the armed forces will also              
              be analyzed.  The empirical strategy is to match armed forces                  
              administrative records on military applicants to military records              
              on entrants, and finally to longitudinal social-security earnings              
              records.  The matched data set will consist of a long panel                    
              containing information on earnings, test scores, veteran status,               
              and demographic characteristics.  Semi-parametric estimators will              
              be developed for estimating the effects of military service in                 
              nonlinear models with unobserved individual effects.
