Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The oceanographic instrumentation program supports requests to                 
              acquire instrumentation for the collection, processing and analysis            
              of oceanographic data.  This proposal from Lamont-Doherty                      
              Geological Observatory (LDGO) requests funding for a computer                  
              network that will be used to maintain and analyze data acquired                
              through NSF-funded research efforts and to support geodynamic                  
              modelling efforts.  The equipment to be purchased includes a high              
              performance server, three high performance workstations, a large               
              capacity data storage system and plotting devices.  LDGO will                  
              supply matching funds for the purchase of the equipment which will             
              supplement the existing LDGO computer system.  The new system will             
              be used extensively by students, and databases maintained on the               
              system will be available to researchers and students nationwide and            
              worldwide via INTERNET.
