Abstract    :
              This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the                      
              continuing work of Professor C. David Gutsche at Texas                         
              Christian University.  The synthesis of enzyme mimics based                    
              upon a calixarene host will be undertaken.  Calixarenes can be                 
              functionalized on both faces and as a result of their                          
              conformational flexibility permit the fashioning of cavities                   
              that can open and close.  Calixarene based aldolase,                           
              chymotryopsin, triosephosphate isomerase, and acetylphosphatase                
              mimics will be examined.  The basic chemistry of calixarenes                   
              will also be examined in an attempt to isolate and                             
              functionalize new examples of these novel molecular receptors.                 
              The complexing capabilities and conformations of several of the                
              new calixarenes will be determined.                                            
              %%%                                                                            
              Synthetic molecules which selectively bind to biologically                     
              important molecules (substrates) will be made.  The synthetic                  
              molecules will be designed in a fashion that places the bound                  
              substrate in close proximity to functional groups (atoms or                    
              groups of atoms) which can assist in the transformation of the                 
              substrate into another biologically important molecule.  The                   
              determination of the shape of the synthetic molecule which                     
              provides the greatest assistance to these transformations will                 
              enhance our understanding of how enzymes increase the rate of                  
              biologically important reactions.
