Abstract    :
                   Feral pigs (Sus scrofa L.) are common animals throughout                  
              much of California.  Their grubbing activities remove vegetation               
              and disturb soil, prompting concern that they may be harming                   
              populations of native plants and encouraging alien weeds.                      
                   This project is concerned with the nature and rate of                     
              revegetation of meadows grubbed by feral pigs.  Observational                  
              techniques, experimental simulations of key features of pig                    
              damage, and transplant experiments will be used to achieve the                 
              following objectives:                                                          
                   1. To describe the seasonality and extent of pig damage                   
                   2. To document the revegetation of areas disturbed by feral               
                      pigs                                                                   
                   3. The describe the responses of plants to grubbing and to                
                      infer plant characteristics responsible for between-                   
              species differences                                                            
                   4. To identify characteristics of grubbing important to                   
              revegetation.                                                                  
                   This research will increase both our understanding of the                 
              threat posed to native plant communities by feral pigs and our                 
              knowledge of the roles that patchiness and disturbance play in                 
              plant communities.
