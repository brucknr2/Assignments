Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Chromaffin cells are the cells in the adrenal gland that secrete               
              adrenalin and noradrenalin (a neurohumor similar to adrenalin).                
              The secretion of these substances is part of the body's response to            
              stress and other environmental conditions requiring body function              
              adjustments.  Although adrenalin and noradrenalin have similar                 
              actions adrenalin is more effective in raising blood sugar levels              
              while noradrenalin is more effective in raising blood pressure.                
              Until recently it was thought that all chromaffin cells were the               
              same.  There is now evidence that cells that secrete adrenalin are             
              quite different from those that secrete noradrenalin.  With the                
              development of methods to isolate and culture them separately it               
              will be possible to study the detailed individual differences from             
              a biochemical perspective.  These studies will provide a more                  
              sophisticated understanding of the physiological mechanisms by                 
              which organisms respond to a variety of environmental stresses.
