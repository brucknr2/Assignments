Abstract    :
              This is a fundamental study of alumina-supported, platinum-tin                 
              bimetallic, hydrocarbon reforming catalysts.  Model and real                   
              catalytic surfaces are studied, including platinized tin oxide                 
              films, tin-decorated platinum crystals, platinum/tin alloy                     
              surfaces, and platinum and/or tin deposited on planar alumina,                 
              planar carbon, or porous alumina.  Various surface analytical                  
              techniques are used, including X-ray photoelectron                             
              spectroscopy (XPS), Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), ion                     
              scattering spectroscopy (ISS), electron energy loss                            
              spectroscopy (EELS), secondary-ion mass spectrometry (SIMS),                   
              electron-stimulated desorption (ESD), and ultraviolet                          
              photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS).  Catalytic reforming                         
              reactions are run at both low and high pressures using a                       
              reactor attached to the ultrahigh-vacuum characterization                      
              system.  Catalytic behavior is correlated with elements of                     
              catalyst structure as elucidated by the characterization                       
              studies.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              Bimetallic reforming catalysts, including the platinum/tin                     
              system studied in this project, are the principal technology                   
              enabling production of larger amounts of high-octane fuels                     
              from ever-decreasing quality grades of crude oil.  They also                   
              have an increasing role in environmental amelioration.                         
              Despite their great economic importance, they are still poorly                 
              understood.  The volumes and added value produced with these                   
              catalysts are such that even small improvements can have egret                 
              economic benefit. //
