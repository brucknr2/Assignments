Abstract    :
              This professional development fellowship will enable an ecologist              
              specializing in restoration biology to study with scholars in the              
              humanities and cultural studies who specialize in environmental                
              ethics and the role of tradition and ritual performance in human               
              societies.  His intention is to bring the material he learns to                
              bear on ethical and value questions raised in the practice of                  
              ecological restoration and to publish journal and magazine articles            
              on his findings.  This base of information about environmental                 
              philosophy and the history of ideas about nature will be used in               
              the development of the journal Restoration and Management Notes,               
              which the investigator edits, in curricula, and in conferences,                
              symposia, workshops and other programs of the University of                    
              Wisconsin at Madison Arboretum and the Society for Ecological                  
              Restoration.
