Abstract    :
              High speed logic is an essential component of                                  
              modern computer and digital systems.  This                                     
              project proposes to explore the application of                                 
              a new class of negative differential resistance                                
              (NDR) devices to digital design.  Several new                                  
              types of devices such as resonant tunneling                                    
              diodes, CHINTS and other devices exhibit                                       
              high switching speeds and negative differential                                
              resistance (NDR).  The NDR characteristics                                     
              have found applications in oscillators and                                     
              microwave power sources but the use of these                                   
              devices for digital applications has been                                      
              explored so far.  Our preliminary results                                      
              indicate that these devices could be used to                                   
              build high speed arithmetic circuits with                                      
              picosecond delays, almost an order of                                          
              magnitude faster than any other known                                          
              semiconductor circuits.
