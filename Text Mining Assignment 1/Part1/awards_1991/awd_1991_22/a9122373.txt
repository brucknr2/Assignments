Abstract    :
                   Professor Gabrielse and his research group capture                        
              antiprotons produced in a high-energy accelerator and cool                     
              them to only 4 degrees Celsius above absolute zero.  The                       
              collections of antiprotons are trapped and their properties                    
              compared and contrasted with their more conventional proton                    
              counterparts.  The ability to directly compare antimatter with                 
              matter will lead to deeper understanding of the basic                          
              structure of our universe.
