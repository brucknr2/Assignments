Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              A satisfactory theory of strategic behavior in games not only must             
              identify the outcomes that are equilibrium points, but also must               
              explain the origin of mutually consistent strategic behavior.                  
              Recently, there has been a renewed interest in the dynamic systems             
              approach to the origin of mutually consistent strategic behavior.              
              This literature can be divided into four broad categories: learning            
              by trial-and-error, best responding to naive beliefs, best                     
              responding to sophisticated beliefs, and evolutionary processes.               
              Unlike theories of strategic rationality, it seems very difficult              
              to select amongst the competing theories using introspection.                  
                                                                                             
              The research will use the scientific method to discriminate between            
              those abstraction assumptions underlying strategic rationality that            
              lead to accurate theories of strategic behavior in observable games            
              and those that do not.  It will focus on the abstraction                       
              assumptions needed to map an observable game into an abstract game             
              and, hence, needed for the extant theory of abstract games to be               
              relevant for an analysis of strategic behavior in observable games.            
              The ultimate goal is to develop an empirical foundation for a                  
              convincing and scientific explanation of the origin of mutually                
              consistent behavior in observable games in which the scientist can             
              observe the rules of the game, the actors selecting actions, the               
              outcome of those actions, and the resulting scores.
