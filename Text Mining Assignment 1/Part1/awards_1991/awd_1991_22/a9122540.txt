Abstract    :
              This award is for support of a program of high-resolution seismic              
              reflection and radio-echo sounding on the surge-type Black Rapids              
              Glacier, Alaska.  Determination of changes in the structure of                 
              the glacier bed during seasonal fluctuations in velocity will be               
              made. The measurements will be made at a location where a 100 to               
              400 % increase in speed is known to occur each year in the early               
              melt season.  Geophysical sensing of the basal zone will be                    
              performed before and during the speed-up.  Surface motion and                  
              uplift, the discharge of water, solutes and sediment in the                    
              terminal stream, meteorological conditions, and water level in                 
              moulins will all be monitored.  These measurements will allow the              
              morphology of the glacier bed to be determined at times of                     
              differing amounts of basal motion, and thus provide valuable                   
              insight into the mechanisms of glacier and ice stream motion and               
              the role of basal water.
