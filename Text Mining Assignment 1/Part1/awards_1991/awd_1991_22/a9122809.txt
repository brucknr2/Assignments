Abstract    :
              Interest in science has long centered on scientific knowledge,                 
              especially "high" theory, but the past decade has seen the                     
              convergence of scholars in many disciplines upon scientific                    
              practice--the doing of science, the process of making theories,                
              facts, instruments, institutions--as a key topic for research.  Dr.            
              Pickering is developing a general analysis of the nature of                    
              scientific practice.  The empirical base for this work consists                
              primarily in two extended case studies from his own work, the                  
              search for quarks in high energy physics and the development of                
              quaternions in mathematics, and three shorter studies drawn from               
              the secondary historical literature.  He is also weaving in other              
              ethnographic and historical studies of science as appropriate.  He             
              is relating his analysis to more familiar perspectives on                      
              scientific knowledge through discussion of contemporary debates on             
              the role of nature, reason and the `social' in science and related             
              debates on the objectivity, relativity or historicity of scientific            
              knowledge.  He is also discussing disciplinarity in science                    
              studies, and suggests that a shared interest in practice can                   
              provide the basis for a genuine synthesis in this field.
