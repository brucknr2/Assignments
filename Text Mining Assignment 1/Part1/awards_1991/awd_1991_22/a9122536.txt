Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research aims to prepare and characterize rigid carbon                    
              clusters known as "Fullerenes".  These new compounds will be hollow            
              molecular spheres consisting of pi-conjugated carbon atoms attached            
              to various functional groups and a large variety of elements to                
              yield novel molecular solids.  Due to the high symmetry, electronic            
              character and functional design of these clusters, it is expected              
              that these molecular solid-state materials will exhibit                        
              unprecedented condensed matter properties.
