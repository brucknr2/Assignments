Abstract    :
              The present proposal is for the continuing and partial support of              
              the U.S. STEP Coordination Office (USSCO).  This office was                    
              established late in 1990 and has as its fundamental objective to               
              assist the U.S. science community in meeting STEP science                      
              objectives.  The U.S. components of STEP include the facilities                
              and projects of NSF, NOAA, NASA, and USAF.  These components                   
              consist of spacecraft, ground-based, rocket, balloon, and theory               
              and simulation programs capable, in the collective sense, of                   
              studying the complete set of coupling mechanisms that are                      
              responsible for the transfer of energy and mass from one region                
              of the solar-terrestrial system to another: GEM, CEDAR, ISTP/GGS,              
              UARS, CRRES, ISY, MAX91, GOES (and associated data available on                
              SELVAX), and suborbital programs.  The USSCO interacts with these              
              and other domestic programs and with those responsible for                     
              accomplishing the detailed international science objectives of                 
              STEP for the purposes of: coordinating joint compaigns for data                
              acquisition and data analysis which meet national and                          
              international science objectives; collecting and disseminating                 
              STEP-related information; and, organizing professional society                 
              meetings and special sessions.  The activities of the USSCO are                
              significant in that they enhance and expedite the scientific                   
              process within the STEP context by identifying and implementing                
              opportunities for synergistic endeavor.
