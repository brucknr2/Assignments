Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The oceanographic instrumentation program supports requests to                 
              acquire instrumentation for the collection, processing and                     
              analysis of oceanographic data.  This proposal from Columbia                   
              University requests funding for equipment that will be used to                 
              support NSF-funded research cruises aboard the R/V EWING, a 239                
              foot vessel that is owned and operated by the University.
