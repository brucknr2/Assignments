Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This research will study public perceptions of possible                   
              global climate change.  The goals of the study are to examine the              
              relative importance of changes in temperature and precipitation                
              and in air pollution for feelings of physical discomfort, for                  
              concerns about the greenhouse effect, and for individuals'                     
              willingness to pay new taxes to prevent certain environmental                  
              changes from becoming reality.  The study will use a factorial                 
              survey design where respondents are presented with several                     
              hypothetical micro-climate scenarios.  The research will take                  
              place in the Los Angeles area.                                                 
                   The study will contribute to our understanding of public                  
              perceptions of changes in climate and the environment, of the                  
              public's concern over the greenhouse effect, and of the price it               
              is willing to pay to prevent certain environmental changes from                
              taking place.  The study will provide very valuable information                
              that can inform the current debate about the greenhouse effect                 
              and the potential increase in mean temperature.
