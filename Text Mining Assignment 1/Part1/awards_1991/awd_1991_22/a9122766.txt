Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The oceanographic instrumentation program supports requests to                 
              acquire instrumentation for the collection, processing and analysis            
              of oceanographic data.  This proposal from the SJS/Moss Landing                
              Marine Laboratory requests funding for equipment that will be used             
              to support NSF-funded research cruises aboard the R/V POINT SUR, a             
              135 foot vessel that is owned by NSF and operated by the                       
              University.
