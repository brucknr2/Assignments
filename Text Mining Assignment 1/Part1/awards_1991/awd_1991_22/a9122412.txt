Abstract    :
                   This is a grant to support a professor and a postdoctoral                 
              research associate in three separate activities.  The primary                  
              one involves the SMC experiment at CERN in Switzerland in                      
              which the spin properties of the neutron and proton are                        
              studied using a beam of polarized muons.  In another                           
              experiment, the Large Volume Detector (LVD) is being assembled                 
              in a large underground laboratory in Italy (Grand Sasso).                      
              This experiment is intended to detect neutrinos from space,                    
              and to search for effects due to changes (oscillations) in                     
              their identities.  In the third effort, the investigator plans                 
              to join with other investigators from Northeastern physics                     
              department in the SDC detector experiment to be built and run                  
              at the SSC in Texas.
