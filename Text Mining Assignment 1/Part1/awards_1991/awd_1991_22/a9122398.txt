Abstract    :
                   Belief functions are an alternative to probabilities for                  
              representing the degree to which we believe in various hypotheses,             
              highlighting different aspects of subjects' uses of evidence.  In              
              particular, belief functions have potential for situations in which            
              the assessor is interested in judging the degree of support or                 
              justification that the evidence affords the hypotheses.  Legal                 
              situations (where the aim is to remove doubt, not to determine                 
              truth) are studied in this project.  there has been little                     
              empirical research in the use of belief functions.  Thus, the                  
              overarching goal is to examine their use as a representational                 
              system.  This project examines subjects' belief functions and                  
              assessments of perceived evidential conflict in response to a                  
              systematic series of evidence sets, each set containing one to                 
              three pieces of evidence.  The evidence is framed within a                     
              hypothetical, but realistic, legal setting.  The sets will vary in             
              complexity in terms of their degree of conflict and in terms of the            
              number of target sets of hypotheses that are implicated.  The study            
              will inform the application of belief functions as a communication             
              language, the applicability and meaningfulness of such functions               
              in a legal setting, and our understanding of individuals' responses            
              to evidential complexity.
