Abstract    :
              We propose to investigate genetic and demographic effects of human-            
              induced population subdivision on the wood frog (Rana sylvatica),              
              an aquatic-breeding, terrestrial-dwelling amphibian of mesic                   
              woodlands.  Our study will examine patterns of genetic variation               
              within and divergence among 25 subpopulations of wood frogs in a               
              heavily urbanized area of southern Connecticut, U.S.A., where                  
              subpopulations vary widely in size (10-1,000 individuals), length              
              of isolation (O, 10, 100, and 10,000 years), and degree of habitat             
              connectivity.  Features of the landscape intervening subpopulations            
              will be correlated with estimates of genetic similarity between                
              subpopulations to examine which geographic features act as barriers            
              versus paths to gene flow.  A novel experimental procedure,                    
              involving placement of artificial breeding pools in selected                   
              landscape configurations, will be used to assess the "porosity" of             
              human-created barriers to disperse froglets.  An examination of how            
              habitat and population fragmentation has proceeded in the study                
              area during the last century (by inspection of maps and aerial                 
              photographs) will aid in understanding how both zoogeographic                  
              factors and historical demography shaped population-level                      
              phylogenies of wood frogs.  Such information is of particular                  
              interest to conservation biologists. who are increasingly concerned            
              with long-term maintenance of genetic diversity in artificially                
              fragmented populations.
