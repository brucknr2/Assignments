Abstract    :
                   Most quantitative research on the determinants of                         
              technological innovation has focused on factors endogenous to the              
              industry, firm, plant, or production process.  The largely case                
              study-based research on industrial districts has emphasized the                
              positive impacts on firm performance of embeddedness into local                
              concentrations of similar productive activity.  This research has              
              not explicitly examined locational factors affecting firm                      
              performance.  This study will attempt to formally model the ways               
              in which the spatial and institutional context conditions the                  
              impacts of technical, economic, and organizational variables on                
              the performance of manufacturing establishments in the                         
              metalworking sector of the economy.  It will investigate the                   
              extent to which variations among U.S. counties in sameness,                    
              diversity, access, and business leadership help to explain inter-              
              plant variation in efficiency, technological innovation, and                   
              plant survival.  Data will come from two panel surveys of over                 
              1000 establishments, the U.S. Census of Manufactures, and                      
              corporate data base files.  Several hypotheses will be tested                  
              with multivariate statistical techniques.                                      
                   This study promises to yield significant new information,                 
              and it will test a new theory on the interplay between inter-                  
              organizational structures and spatial context.  It will implement              
              new empirical measures of the extent to which agglomeration                    
              influences the performance of manufacturing firms in the U.S.
