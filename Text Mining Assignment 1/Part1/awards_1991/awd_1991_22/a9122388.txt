Abstract    :
                   Professor Hartmann will continue his studies of quantum                   
              optics, the interaction of radiation fields with atoms.                        
              Cooperative cascade superfluorescence will be studied in a three-              
              level system.  Superfluorescence is a collective effect occurring              
              when an ensemble of atoms are stimulated to emit radiation in                  
              phase.  Cascade superfluorescence takes place when a collection                
              of atoms, initially prepared in an excited state, emit to an                   
              intermediate state, and finally cascade to a lower-lying final                 
              state.  The time evolution of the radiation, its intensity and                 
              direction of emission, will provide new insight into the way                   
              quantized radiation fields interact with quantized atomic                      
              systems.
