Abstract    :
              This project consists of three sections.  The first is the examination         
              of algorithms which integrate code ordering and register allocation..          
              In this, expressions are translated into interlock-free code using the         
              minimum number of registers possible.  Next, probabilistic techniques          
              will be used to handle global register allocation.  And, the role of           
              call frequency analysis and specialization in reducing call overhead           
              will be studied.
