Abstract    :
              Environmental politics poses challenges to the decision making                 
              process: Environmental problems transcend political boundaries, and            
              often resemble a zero-sum game played out between interests for                
              environmental protection and conservation and economic development.            
              Regional environmental policies have been proposed, but it is not              
              clear that existing interstate compacts can cooperate to offset                
              collective action problems found in environmental policy.  This                
              project involves the analysis of several case studies with a goal              
              of developing a typology of environmental regional forms of                    
              collective action.
