Abstract    :
              A multidisciplinary study will be conducted to test the                        
              hypothesis that planktivorous seabirds will concentrate their                  
              foraging where tidal and sub-tidal currents, interacting with                  
              bathymetry, transport and concentrate zooplankton near the                     
              surface in spatially predictable upwellings and fronts.  It is                 
              hypothesized that quasi-permanent fronts, caused by horizontal                 
              gradients in mixing associated with gradients in tidal velocity                
              and bottom depth, will be of importance to the birds.  Physical                
              processes and plankton distributions in both shallow (100 m) and               
              deep (600 m) passes near Buldir Island will be compared, as will               
              avian responses to concentrations of prey in both the horizontal               
              and vertical dimensions.  Advanced technologies including an                   
              Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP), an integrating                       
              echosounder, multiple opening-closing nets (MOCNESS) and                       
              computerized data entry and real-time analyses of results to                   
              optimize use of the ship will be employed.  The study provides a               
              unique opportunity to combine the benefits of new technologies                 
              for investigating how physical processes affect the distribution               
              and concentration of plankton that support higher trophic levels.              
              The study will be one of the few to examine simultaneously                     
              physical processes, zooplankton distributions and abundance, and               
              the foraging ecology of marine birds in the western Aleutians.                 
              This suite of information will permit comparison of the marine                 
              ecology of seabirds on oceanic islands with that of seabirds on                
              nearby continental islands studied previously.
