Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                         ABSTRACT                                            
                                                                                            
              This research will explore the interacting roles of social,                    
              attributional, and metacognitive contributors to first-grade                   
              children's preferences for math strategies.  Children are                      
              hypothesized to accumulate a set of preferred math strategies                  
              based on perceived social acceptability of the strategies, their               
              attributions about the role of effort in learning, and                         
              metacognitive knowledge.  Children who believe that effort in                  
              learning increases ability, as opposed to children who believe                 
              that ability is stable, are believed to develop more                           
              metacognitive knowledge about strategies and to use strategies                 
              that result in good performance.  Children who believe ability to              
              be stable and indicative of intelligence are expected to be more               
              influenced in their use of math strategies by teachers',                       
              parents', and peers' attitudes toward strategies.  The                         
              development of strategies and mathematical performance across a                
              single school year will be examined as a function of perceived                 
              social attitudes toward strategies, strategy training in the                   
              school and home, attributional beliefs, and metacognitive                      
              factors.  Of special interest will be the shift from external                  
              strategies (e.g., fingers) to internal strategies (e.g., mental                
              calculation) since much of children's early strategy use is                    
              external and therefore open to the effects of social comment on                
              the desirability of such strategies.
