Abstract    :
              Recent work on quantum mechanics has focussed on the measurement               
              problem.  Because processes used to prepare systems in specifiable             
              quantum mechanical states are similar to measurements, it is                   
              commonly thought that preparations also suffer from a similar                  
              "preparation problem."  Little work has previously been done on                
              preparations, however, or on this apparent preparation problem.                
              Recently, Dr. Wessels has shown that there is no preparation                   
              problem strictly analogous to the measurement problem.  Two                    
              problems, roughly similar to the measurement problem do arise,                 
              however, when some of the processes generally assumed to be                    
              preparations are analyzed quantum mechanically.  A rough analysis              
              of several examples suggests some ways one of these problems might             
              be solved.  One goal of this project is to work out these                      
              suggestions in detail, to see whether they work.  Another is to                
              clarify the difficulties encountered in trying to solve the second             
              problem.  Also, Dr. Wessels is undertaking a survey of physics                 
              literature to determine what types of processes are currently being            
              used for preparation.  She is analyzing processes representative               
              of these types to see if they also suffer from the two problems,               
              and for those that do, she is seeking solutions.  She is also                  
              addressing related issues and is exploring further the connection              
              between preparation and measurement.
