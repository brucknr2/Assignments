Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This MRI Research Planning Grant (RPG) will enable a young minority            
              woman faculty member to develop a competitive proposal in the area             
              of quantum effect phenomena in electronic materials.  Her                      
              background and expertise is in the MBE growth of such materials and            
              structures.  The requested RPG will provide the PI with the support            
              needed to gather and review additional literature, carefully                   
              formulate materials calculations needed for design and growth of               
              double barrier resonant tunneling structures appropriate to the                
              line of research she intends to follow, to establish direct                    
              contacts with active researchers in this field, and to further                 
              collaborations in progress.                                                    
              %%%                                                                            
              Research in this field is oriented toward the examination of hot               
              electron and phonon-assisted tunneling effects under double barrier            
              resonant tunneling conditions associated with quantum confinement              
              structures fabricated in thin layers of semiconductors.  The                   
              research forms the basis for advanced electronic and photonic                  
              devices having potential performance beyond conventional device                
              structures and configurations.
