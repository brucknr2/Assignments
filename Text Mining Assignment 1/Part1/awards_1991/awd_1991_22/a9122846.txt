Abstract    :
              The relationships among the placental mammals are poorly understood            
              at the ordinal level.  This study will employ enzymatic                        
              amplification (polymerase chain reaction) and nucleotide sequencing            
              of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit II gene in a number            
              of eutherian orders.  Specifically, the postulated superorders                 
              Archonta (comprised of primates, tree shrews, bats, and flying                 
              lemurs) and Glires (rodents, rabbits, and pikas) will be examined              
              in detail.  In addition, this gene will be sequenced in potential              
              sister taxa to some of these orders, such as insectivores and                  
              elephant shrews.  Interordinal variation will be assessed for each             
              group and hypotheses of relationship will be based upon the                    
              identification of shared, derived characters (synapomorphies) using            
              an armadillo and pangolin as outgroup taxa.  The results of this               
              study should provide a strong framework within which to interpret              
              the radiation of a flying-gliding lifestyle in eutherians and the              
              unique cranial traits of rodents and rabbits.
