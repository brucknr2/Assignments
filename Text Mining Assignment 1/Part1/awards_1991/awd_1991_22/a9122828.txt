Abstract    :
              An investigation of the reactions of a variety of species in                   
              the gas phase will be conducted. Reaction rates and product                    
              distributions will be analyzed as a function of structure and                  
              electronic properties of the reactive species. The proposed                    
              work will include studies of reactions between radicals and                    
              cations, cation fragmentation processes which proceed by either                
              concerted or non-concerted paths, and processes involving                      
              doubly bonded phosphorous. By use of flaming afterglow                         
              techniques, the kinetics of the reactions under investigation                  
              will be determined by injecting reactive species into flowing                  
              streams of transient gas phase molecules which themselves have                 
              been selected via the use of a quadrupole mass filter. In                      
              addition to yielding critical thermodynamic information about                  
              gas phase reactions, the investigation will be instrumental in                 
              providing insight into naturally occuring processes in the                     
              atmosphere.                                                                    
              %%%                                                                            
              This grant will provide funding for the continuing studies of                  
              gas phase reactions by Dr. C. H. DePuy and Dr. V. M. Bierbaum                  
              at the University of Colorado at Boulder. The investigation is                 
              designed to yield critical data concerning reactive processes                  
              which are fundamental to a large number of important chemical                  
              processes. In additional to generating rate and product                        
              distribution data, which can be utilized by chemists to predict                
              the occurence of new chemical reactions, this investigation                    
              will also have a significant impact upon our general                           
              understanding of reactions which take place in the earth's                     
              atmosphere: this should provide direction for the development                  
              of chemical processes for maintaining the integrity of the                     
              atmosphere and insuring a quality environment.
