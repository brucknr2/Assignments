Abstract    :
              This award supports a study designed to:  1)  establish Sr isotope             
              compositions for each of the Late Cenozoic lithostratigraphic units            
              of the central Arctic Ocean, 2)  correlate the Sr isotope curve                
              that will be established for the Arctic Ocean to that recognized in            
              the sub-Arctic oceans, 3)  relate the ages established using                   
              isotopic ratios to the magnetic stratigraphy, oxygen isotope, and              
              amino-acid chronologic data that are recognized in the Arctic, and             
              4)  use the central Arctic Ocean Sr isotope compositions to assess             
              ages for the widespread Arctic sediment and stratigraphic units of             
              unknown age, and for sediment not well constrained by any of the               
              other stratigraphic tools.  This approach has the potential to                 
              produce high resolution stratigraphic correlations and overcome the            
              largest obstacle to long range sedimentological and stratigraphic              
              interpretations for the Arctic Ocean.  In addition, Nd isotope                 
              compositions of Arctic Ocean samples will be determined.  Because              
              of the very short residence time of Nd in the oceans, samples                  
              selected from widely different areas of the Arctic Ocean will                  
              identify sources of continental input and amount of sediment                   
              dispersal.  All samples for this work will come from existing cores            
              and materials in the University of Wisconsin collection.
