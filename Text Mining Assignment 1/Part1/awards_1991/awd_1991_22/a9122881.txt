Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The primary objective of this US-Polish Joint Fund project between             
              Dr. Ryszard Kozlowski of the Institute of Natural Fibers and Dr.               
              Tom Maloney of the Washington State University is to research use              
              of some annual plants wastes for production of particleboards.  The            
              researchers will also perform research on urea-formaldehyde resin              
              that allows lowering of formaldehyde emmissions.  The proposed                 
              research will provide new knowledge of a production of a new                   
              class of particleboards with lowered formaldehyde emission on the              
              basis of annual plants wastes and modified urea-formaldehyde                   
              resins.                                                                        
                                                                                             
              This project in materials fulfills the program objectives of                   
              advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the              
              U.S. and Poland to combine complementary efforts and capabilities              
              in areas of strong mutual interest and competence on the basis of              
              equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.
