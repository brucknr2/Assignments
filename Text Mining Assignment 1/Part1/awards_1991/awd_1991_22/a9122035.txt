Abstract    :
              In the phase II work proposed research we will determine the                   
              overlapping relationships between-10,000 clones from a cosmid                  
              library derived from partially-digested, chromosome-sorted human               
              DNA.  This information will allow the creation of an ordered                   
              chromosome specific library.  This library, and others to follow,              
              will be indispensable tools for the human genome mapping and                   
              sequencing project.  The phase II work will create an ordered                  
              cosmid library as well as kits, devices, and instruction manuals               
              that can be used by other investigators to accomplish the same                 
              result on segments of DNA as large as entire human chromosomes.                
              The phase II work involves cross-hybridization of the inserts from             
              a large number of cosmid clones to each other independently in all             
              combinations using the "pen-line" method developed in phase I work.            
              The "pen-line" method allows discrete hybridization of all cloned              
              DNAs separately and independently to all probes generated from the             
              same set clones and, therefore, allows for simultaneous                        
              determination of the overlap between all clones in the set.  The               
              method is several fold faster than current repeatable  protocol.               
              In phase II work, we propose to use the method on an overlapping               
              clone library derived from chromosome 20.
