Abstract    :
              Molecular architecture of chromosomes remains one of the major                 
              mysteries of modern genetics.  In spite of impressive advances made            
              in learning the nucleotide sequence of chromosomes, the mechanisms             
              of packing functional DNA into the small space available is                    
              unsolved.  One organizing mechanism is supercoiling.  DNA is found             
              supercoiled in all organisms to about the same extent.  Another                
              puzzle is the fact that only a fraction of the genetic information             
              is actively used at any instant.  Learning how DNA is organized in             
              both active and inactive regions of chromosomes is known as the                
              domain problem. Bacteriophage MU is one of the most useful tools               
              for studying chromosome structure.  Mu is a transposon that                    
              randomly inserts itself into bacterial chromosomes and creates its             
              own supercoiled domain using host enzymes and proteins.  Further,              
              through novel Mu genetics, it was discovered that one of the most              
              abundant chromosomal proteins in E. coli, H-NS, supercoils DNA.                
              DNA supercoiled by H-NS is inactive for transcription.  Thus, H-NS             
              is a prime candidate for organizing inactive supercoiled domains.              
              Experiments are designed to probe the structure of H-NS                        
              interactions with Mu DNA using genetic approaches as well as                   
              chemical and enzymatic probes and electron microscopy.
