Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Under certain conditions, absorption of a photon in an ultrathin               
              superconducting film can generate a relatively large voltage pulse.            
              They propose to explore this phenomenon further in both low-Tc and             
              high-Tc sc films; they will explore the feasibility of an ultra-               
              sensitive, fast infrared photodetector based upon the phenomenon.
