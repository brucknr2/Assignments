Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                   This is a collaborative research project (with McCarthy) on              
              the media coverage of demonstrations in Washington DC in 1982 and              
              1991.  Newspaper stories and television news have become a common              
              source of evidence for describing and interpreting the intensity,              
              duration and political content of public protest.  There is wide               
              suspicion, however, that media coverage of such events are a                   
              non-random selection of all demonstrations taking place.  It                   
              therefore becomes important to understand how media institutions               
              select from the vast range of actual events.  This study will                  
              compare data from the demonstration permit application records of              
              all police agencies that require protestors to obtain permits with             
              local and national print and electronic news stories about                     
              demonstrations.  The study will focus on demonstrations in                     
              Washington DC.                                                                 
                    This study is important for two reasons.  It will improve our            
              understanding of how and what newspapers and television news select            
              to cover in the news, and it will provide researchers with much                
              better knowledge about the potential bias of evidence based on                 
              newspaper and television sources.
