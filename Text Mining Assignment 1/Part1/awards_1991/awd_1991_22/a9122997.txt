Abstract    :
              The investigator will establish a network server for biological                
              sequences database entries, which will allow scientists to have                
              access to these entries without the overhead of maintaining local              
              copies of entire databases.  This service will allow any user with             
              an Internet confection to participate.  FarFetch will allow users              
              to obtain sequence entries in a directly usable form as opposed to             
              conventional e-mail base sequence retrievers.  Clients for the VMS,            
              UNIX and Macintosh operating systems have been written and are in              
              the field.  Development of MS-DOS and Windows clients are planned.             
              This award supports the purchase of the server and supporting                  
              storage equipment.  Client software will be made available via                 
              anonymous FTP from the server.  There will be no usage fees                    
              associated with the server.
