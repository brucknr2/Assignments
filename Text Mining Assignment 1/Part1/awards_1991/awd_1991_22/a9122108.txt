Abstract    :
              The objective is the measurement of the thermophoretic forces                  
              acting on single particles suspended in an electrodynamic                      
              balance, and the evaluation of existing theories related to                    
              this experiment.  The focus is on relatively large particles                   
              and high thermal conductivities, for which negative                            
              thermophoretic effects have been suggested.  Single particles                  
              will be suspended in an electrodynamic balance and will be                     
              sized by use of their Mie resonance and angular spectra.                       
              Thermal gradients from 0 to 75 K/cm and mean temperatures from                 
              250 to 400 K will be studied.                                                  
                                                                                             
              The research is of fundamental nature, and has relevance to                    
              several industrial processes, including manufacture of optical                 
              fibers, clean room technology, particle erosion and deposition                 
              processes, as well as pollution and combustion.
