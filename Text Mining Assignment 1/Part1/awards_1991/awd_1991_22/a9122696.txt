Abstract    :
              In cognitive psychology, theoretical models of the mental processes            
              underlying cognitive abilities are proposed, tested and revised on             
              the basis of patterns of performance over a range of cognitive                 
              tasks in single-case and group studies involving subjects with                 
              varying degrees of brain damage.  A theory of cognition is a                   
              modular functional architecture that provides a computationally                
              explicit, information-processing account of how the mental                     
              representations required to perform these cognitive tasks are                  
              produced.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              Professor Bub is continuing his research applying Dr. Clark                    
              Glymour's `bootstrapping' account of relevant evidence to a current            
              methodological controversy in cognitive neuropsychology, concerning            
              the relation between theory and evidence from single-case and group            
              studies on brain-damaged and normal subjects.  Professor Bub has               
              reformulated the original project as an aspect of the general                  
              problem of how to reliably infer causal relations (representing a              
              model of cognition) from probability relations (representing                   
              performance data from normal and brain-damaged subjects).  This new            
              investigation concerns the status of some of the assumptions that              
              guarantee the existence of a reliable methodology for cognitive                
              neuropsychology, as well as the single-case versus group studies               
              problem that motivated the original inquiry.
