Abstract    :
                   The Polypodiaceae is one of the largest families of                       
              homosporous ferns and in the New World is represented by the single            
              tribe Polypodieae. About 90% of the species in the tribe occur in              
              the neotropics where they are a conspicuous component of the                   
              epiphytic flora. Despite this concentration of species in the                  
              tropics, biosystematic studies within the tribe have focused only              
              on the temperate zone species in the genus Polypodium. Graduate                
              student Elisabeth Andrews, under the direction of faculty advisor              
              Christopher Haufler, will apply analytical techniques that have                
              proven successful in studies of Polypodium to a group of closely               
              related tropical species. Morphological and molecular data will be             
              combined in distinguishing species and in resolving phylogenetic               
              or genealogical relationships within the Pleopeltis complex, a                 
              group of 15 simple-leaved species. Fieldwork in Jamaica and Costa              
              Rica will provide plant material for cultivation, for chromosomal,             
              isozymic (protein), and chloroplast DNA analyses. The anticipated              
              research will complete the first biosystematic study of a group of             
              epiphytic ferns, which integrates molecular and morphological data,            
              and as such it may serve as a foundation for future studies within             
              the predominantly epiphytic Polypodiaceae.
