Abstract    :
              This award is in support of a one year standard grant to                       
              investigate ice ocean interactions during the late Quaternary in               
              the Hudson Strait region of the northwest North Atlantic, which                
              is the major sediment and meltwater route for deglaciation of the              
              Laurentide Ice Sheet.  Sediment cores will be obtained during a                
              1992 cruise to Hudson Strait and Frobisher Bay and these will be               
              analyzed for:  1) carbon-14 of foraminifera, 20 stable oxygen and              
              carbon isotopes of planktonic and benthic foraminifera, 3) down                
              core mineralogy, and 4) changes in foraminifera species
