Abstract    :
                   This is a Small Grant for Exploratory Research proposal to                
              conduct laboratory fluid dynamical experiments on flow in the                  
              Earth's liquid outer core.  The PIs will investigate the combined              
              effects of Earth's spin and precession on buoyantly-driven flow in             
              a fluid spheroid, whose shape approximates the shape of the core-              
              mantle boundary.  The purpose is to determine the influence of                 
              unsteady rotation on core motions, arising from the 23,000 yr luni-            
              solar precession of the mantle.  In particular, the relative                   
              importance of buoyancy and precessional effects in controlling the             
              structure of fluid motions just below the core-mantle boundary,                
              where geomagnetic secular variations have been used to infer the               
              pattern fluid motion will be determined.  The PIs will carry out               
              a series of experiments using a liquid-filled spheroidal cavity                
              mounted on a rotation/precession apparatus, with boundary                      
              temperature control.  This is the first time the effects of                    
              convection and precession have been investigated simultaneously in             
              a rotating fluid with the geometry of the Earth's core.  They                  
              intend to (1) determine the pattern of flow due to thermal buoyancy            
              and due to precession, and (2) measure the zonal flows, meridional             
              flows and differential rotation produced by precession and                     
              convection.  The ultimate goal is to develop a comprehensive                   
              experimental approach to the processes that underlay magnetic field            
              generation in the Earth's core.
