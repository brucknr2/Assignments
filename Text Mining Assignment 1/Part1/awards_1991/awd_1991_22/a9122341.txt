Abstract    :
              Theoretical research will be done on surface processes for systems             
              out of equilibrium, such as surface reaction with fresh feed                   
              (catalysis), irreversible adsorption on surfaces, and irreversible             
              growth processes.  The goal of the research is to develop a                    
              fundamental understanding of the nature of these irreversible                  
              systems, to elucidate the relation of the steady-state behavior                
              with equilibrium states, and to explore the unusual kinetic phase              
              transitions that these systems display.  This understanding will               
              lead to improved modeling and design of actual catalytic systems.

              This research involves a studies of a number of irreversible                   
              systems.  Included are models to help understand catalytic                     
              reactions of importance to the automotive and chemical industries              
              and to help understand growth phenomena which occur as thin films,             
              for instance, are deposited during molecular beam epitaxy.
