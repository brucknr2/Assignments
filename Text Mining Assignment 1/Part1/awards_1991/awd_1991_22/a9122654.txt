Abstract    :
              It is now widely accepted that stress conditions lead to an                    
              increase in the frequencies of mutation measured by selection.  The            
              question now raised by the "Directed mutation" issue is the                    
              specificity of the changes induced by particular stress regimes. To            
              answer this question, it is necessary to characterize all DNA                  
              changes regardless of whether they facilitate growth under                     
              selective conditions.  This can now be done by PCR technology.  PCR            
              makes it possible to examine specific regions of the genome                    
              following stress and detect novel DNA structures, even if they can             
              not be selected by growth. Initial results demonstrated that a                 
              specific class of DNA rearrangement mediated by the Mu phage                   
              transposable element did not measurably occur under normal growth              
              conditions but were easily detectable at relatively high                       
              frequencies under selective conditions.  Use of PCR will now allow             
              detection of the frequency and time of occurance of such genetic               
              rearrangements with and without the selective techniques that are              
              usually required for measuring mutation rates.
