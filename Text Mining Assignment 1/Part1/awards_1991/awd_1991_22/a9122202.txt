Abstract    :
              The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution will undertake a                      
              technology development project to improve the operating                        
              capabilities of Seasoar -- a widely used undulating towed                      
              vehicle that is used for making sustained measurements of                      
              physical, optical and other parameters in the upper 300-400                    
              meters of the ocean at speeds of 8 knots.  This SGER project                   
              will develop a set of engineering parameters to describe and                   
              evaluate the hydrodynamics and control of the towed vehicle                    
              in order to make its performance more reliable and                             
              predictable in a variety of sea states and scientific                          
              payload configurations.  Design specifications and software                    
              will be made freely available to other groups using the                        
              Seasoar.  As research interests become more focussed upon                      
              the spatial structure in the upper ocean, a sustained                          
              interest in using the Seasoar is anticipated.
