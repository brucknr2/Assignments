Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Measurements of the collective excitations of liquid helium have               
              led to a detailed understanding of the microscopic dynamics in both            
              the normal and superfluid phases.  Inelastic neutron scattering has            
              proven to be one of the most useful tools in studying these                    
              excitations.  It is proposed to extend these studies to negative               
              pressures.  At low negative pressure the liquid is metastable,                 
              allowing measurements to be carried out.  At larger negative                   
              pressures (around 9 bars), the speed of sound approaches zero and              
              the liquid is no longer stable.  Macroscopic samples (one or more              
              cc. in volume) of liquid He at negative pressure will be created               
              using a novel expansion cell.  The time structure of a typical                 
              short-pulse neutron source will be used to carry out inelastic n               
              scattering measurements in the interval between pressure                       
              equilibration and the nucleation of gas bubbles.
