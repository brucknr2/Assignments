Abstract    :
              This project is a study of the processes active in determining the             
              characteristics of aerosols that are removed from the arctic                   
              atmosphere and deposited in the Greenland ice sheet.  These                    
              processes involve the dynamics of tropospheric and stratospheric               
              mass exchange, the efficiency with which aerosols and associated               
              chemical species are removed from the lower atmosphere, the                    
              relative importance of wet and dry deposition, and the early                   
              post-depositional chemical and concentration changes in the snow.              
              Knowledge of these processes is crucial to the reconstruction of               
              paleoatmospheres from the record that is preserved in the ice                  
              sheet.                                                                         
                   Air sample filters and snow and ice samples collected at the              
              Atmospheric Chemistry Camp that is part of the Greenland Ice Core              
              drilling program will be analyzed for radionuclides, including                 
              Beryllium-7, Beryllium-10, Chlorine-36, and Lead-210.  Beryllium-7             
              is a cosmogenic radionuclide that is useful as a tracer of                     
              intrusions of stratospheric air, while Lead-210 results from the               
              decay of radon emitted from the Earth's surface and is a tracer for            
              continental air masses.  While Chlorine-36 is an important                     
              modulator in ozone chemistry, its ratio to Beryllium-10 may                    
              possibly become a method for dating ice cores older than 50,000                
              years.  Results to date have been mixed because the ratio can                  
              fluctuate greatly over small depth intervals.  This project however            
              will obtain data on time scales short enough to determine whether              
              short term differences in the transport mechanism or seasonal                  
              variations in the efficiency of the removal process cause the                  
              observed fluctuations.
