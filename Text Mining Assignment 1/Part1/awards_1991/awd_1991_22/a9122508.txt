Abstract    :

              The Impact of Shared  Simulation Models and Tailorable Information Viewing on
              Group  Decision Making Outcomes and Processes             This is the third
              year funding of a three-year continuing  award.  Simulation models can be
              useful decision aids for many  kinds of problems, and have been incorporated
              into Decision Support  Systems for single users.  But many important problems
              require  group decision making, and effective ways of making simulation  models
              available to groups need to be developed.  This research  evaluates the
              usefulness of computer simulation models in group  policy negotiations, using
              laboratory and real-world tasks in the  domain of river basin management.  It
              compares five different modes  of model access during negotiations, ranging
              from no access at all  to free access controlled by the group of negotiators as
              a whole.   Since different negotiators in a group typically have interests in  
              different aspects of a policy decision this research explores the   usefulness
              of permitting negotiators to create tailored views of   model results, so that
              they can quickly evaluate the impact of a   policy alternative on their
              particular interests.  Tailored views   may exclude unimportant data and may
              compute and present useful   transformations of raw model results.  The results
              of the proposed   studies should be of direct value in exploiting advances in  
              computer simulation technology and user interface design in support  of group
              policy negotiations.
