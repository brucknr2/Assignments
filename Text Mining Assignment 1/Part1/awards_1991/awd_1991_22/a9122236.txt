Abstract    :
              In this Experimental Physical Chemistry project,sponsored by                   
              the Chemistry Division, Prof. Maroncelli (Pennsylvania State                   
              University) will measure picosecond kinetics of excited state                  
              proton transfer reactions and their catalysis by alcohol                       
              solvents. Mechanistic analysis of the data will be carried out                 
              with the aid of molecular dynamic simulations. The result will                 
              be a detailed understanding of the role of solvent geometry in                 
              assisting this important class of chemical reactions.

              Chemical reactions in which a single proton hops from place to                 
              place in a molecule occur widely in nature, and play a central                 
              role in both biochemical and technologically important                         
              processes. These reactions are typically too fast to be studied                
              in detail. Prof. Maroncelli (Pennsylvania State University)                    
              will address this problem using new, ultrafast optical                         
              spectroscopic methods and powerful computer simulations. The                   
              result will be a molecular level understanding of one of the                   
              most important reactions in chemistry.
