Abstract    :
              This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic                  
              Program provides continued support to Dr. Robert R. Holmes of                  
              the Chemistry Department, University of Massachusetts at                       
              Amherst, for the investigation of high valent silicon and                      
              phosphorus compounds.  Anionic, hexacoordinated silicon                        
              compounds will be prepared and their characteristics will be                   
              compared to analogous phosphorus compounds.  Acyclic, pentaoxy,                
              anionic silicates will be studied in order to understand more                  
              concerning the initial steps in silanol polymerization.  The                   
              structure and conformational properties of pentacoordinte                      
              phosphorus and silicon compunds containing rings varying in                    
              size from 6- to 8- membered will be studied, particularly as                   
              relevant to cAMP mechanisms.  Also to be investigated is the                   
              mechanistic pathway for nucleophilic displacement reactions of                 
              tetracoordinate phosphorus and silicon.  A wide range of tools                 
              will be used to characterize the compounds, including variable                 
              temperature NMR, X-ray diffraction, and molecular modeling.                    
              %%%                                                                            
              Only recently has it become possible to compare the behavior of                
              silicon compounds with five or six groups attached to silicon                  
              to the behavior of analogous phosphorus compounds.  By                         
              comparing the details of reactions in which such compounds                     
              rearrange or lose the fifth or sixth group, it is possible to                  
              understand more about how spatial and electronic factors affect                
              the chemistry of these compounds.  This fundamental research                   
              project may help provide insight into the formation of silicon                 
              polymers or into the hydrolysis of nucleoside cyclic                           
              3',5'-monophosphates, which play a central role in the                         
              regulation of cell metabolism.
