Abstract    :
              The proposal is to continue the studies of the Sun at the Big                  
              Bear Solar Observatory, exploiting the excellent observing                     
              conditions and specialized solar instruments.  The data obtained               
              are then studied at Caltech.  They propose to:                                 
              1)   continue comprehensive observations of the Sun in various                 
                   wavelengths, and of the Doppler and vector magnetic fields.               
              2)   continuous measurements of vector magnetic fields and                     
                   velocity fields in active regions and magnetic movies in Ho               
                   to understand the causes of solar flares.                                 
              3)   study new data showing a strong influence of sunspot motions              
                   in causing flares.                                                        
              4)   study the motions and flows in sunspots to understand how                 
                   they form and what keeps them stable.                                     
              5)   observe solar flares in the infrared helium line, hitherto                
                   not possible on a regular basis.                                          
              6)   continue our BEARALERT program of electronic warning of high              
                   probability of solar flares.                                              
              7)   study important details of sunspot structures.                            
              8)   make round-the-clock observations of solar magnetic fields                
                   to understand their evolution and development.
