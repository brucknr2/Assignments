Abstract    :
              This is an award to support research on the use of a beam                      
              of high energy electons to reduce the emission of                              
              pollutants in gases emitted from combustion processes.                         
              The objective of this project is to provide a sufficiently                     
              comprehensive demonstration of the concept's technical                         
              feasibility to determine its economic viability and                            
              commercial potential.  Tasks include design, fabrication                       
              and operation of an experimental system to process                             
              simulated exhaust gases; experiments to characterize                           
              reduction in pollutant concentrations as a function of                         
              dose and to identify products produced during application                      
              of the process; performance of theoretical analyses to                         
              establish models for application of the concept to                             
              engineering design; and development of a conceptual design                     
              for a full-scale processing system capable of operating at                     
              a gas flow-rate of 5,000 liters per second.                                    
                                                                                             
              The proposal leading to this recommendation results from                       
              completion of a Phase I, Small Business Innovation                             
              Research project conducted under NSF Grant No. 90-61169 in                     
              which the scientific feasibility of this concept was                           
              demonstrated.  This Phase II award was made in accord with                     
              procedures contained in Program Solicitation NSF 90-31,                        
              Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR).
