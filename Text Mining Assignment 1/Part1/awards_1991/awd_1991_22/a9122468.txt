Abstract    :
                   MU-SPIN, The Minority University-Space Interdisciplinary                  
              Network is a program for HBCU's and MU's, as well as colleges with             
              a significant minority enrollment, which is oriented around wide               
              area networking technology and its use for supporting multi-                   
              disciplinary research.  Sponsorship is by the NASA Goddard Space               
              Flight Center, Data and Computing Division, the University Programs            
              Office, the Equal Opportunity Office, and NASA Headquarters.                   
                   This project is to support the September 25-27. 1991 meeting              
              of the MU-SPIN Users Working Group at the Goddard Space Flight                 
              Center.  The meeting is to provide a forum for the exchange of                 
              ideas on networking to support interdisciplinary research.                     
                   Funding will support the cost of participant travel, meals,               
              and meeting arrangements.  The project is directly related to the              
              interests of the Computer and Information Science and Engineering              
              Directorate in that CISE is actively supporting programs to enhance            
              the opportunities of underrepresented populations in the computer              
              field.  Access to adequate facilities, and the interchange made                
              available by network connections is an important aspect of this                
              effort, and the program of the workshop should enhance the                     
              opportunities of the participants.
