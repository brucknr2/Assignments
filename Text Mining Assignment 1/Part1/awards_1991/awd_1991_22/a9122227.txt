Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award is for the renewal of the Materials Research Group at               
              Case Western Reserve University (Grant                                         
              of structure, dynamics, and transitions of liquid crystalline                  
              polymers.  The primary goal of the research by the group is to                 
              understand the physical and chemical requirements for generation of            
              crystalline structures containing fully extended chains from                   
              neumatic columnar hexagonal phases and copolymers containing these             
              phases.  The research emphasis is on synthesis of polymers, having             
              controlled molecular structure, which are predicted to have                    
              neumatic of columnar phases, with focus on main chain polyesters               
              and polyethers in which asymmetric mesogens are linked by flexible             
              spacers.  The work also includes synthesis of supramolecular self-             
              assembling polymers designed to have cylindrical conformations,                
              preparation and characterization of micro-phase-separated                      
              supramolecular assemblies, based on block co-polymers that contain             
              different mesomorphic and glassy segments.  The structure and                  
              dynamics of these polymers is being determined by x-ray and neutron            
              scattering, static and dynamic light scattering, fluorescence                  
              energy transfer spectroscopy, and nuclear magnetic resonance                   
              spectroscopy.  The electronic, magnetic, optical, and dielectric               
              properties are also being determined.  Theoretical analyses of the             
              molecular assembly, dynamics, phase transitions, rheology and other            
              physical properties of the mesophases is also being done in                    
              parallel with the experimental effort.
