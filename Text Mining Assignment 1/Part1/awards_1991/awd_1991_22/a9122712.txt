Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Repetitive movements such as chewing, walking, and swimming, which             
              are done relatively unconsciously, are controlled by groups of                 
              connected nerve cells known as central pattern generators (CPG).               
              The subject of this award to Dr. Peter Rowat will be modeling of               
              a CPG which controls buccal movements in an invertebrate; this                 
              system has been studied extensively over the past two decades and              
              a large amount of experimental data are available that can be used             
              for modeling the underlying mechanisms of this CPG. To investigate             
              these mechanisms, simplified, but biologically relevant,                       
              mathematical models will be developed; the output of these models              
              will then be compared with the experimentally observed CPG output.             
              The influence of neuromodulatory substances on the model will be               
              tested. Prediction of the most important biological components of              
              this CPG can be made by varying the strengths of components of the             
              model in computer simulations and by mathematical analysis. This               
              research will contribute to understanding the way in which                     
              repetitive movements are controlled by the central nervous system.
