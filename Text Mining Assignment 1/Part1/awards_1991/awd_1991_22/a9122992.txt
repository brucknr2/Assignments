Abstract    :
              This is an nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) study of the structure,            
              dynamics, and electronic states in quantum-confined small clusters             
              and icosohedral alloys.  The research will involve development of              
              sophisticated NMR techniques that will allow the resolution of                 
              atomic environments characteristic of interior atoms in clusters as            
              well as surface atoms.  By separately monitoring the interior and              
              the surface, it will be possible to understand the bulk and surface            
              melting process and to investigate the lattice dynamics near the               
              melting point.  Th double resonance technique and refinements                  
              thereof wil be used to study host-guest interactions between                   
              inclusion clusters and molecular sieve frameworks, such as                     
              aluminophosphate sieve materials.
