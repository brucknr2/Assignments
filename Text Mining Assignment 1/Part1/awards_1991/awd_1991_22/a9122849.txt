Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This proposal seeks support for the Fifth International                   
              Congress on Cell Biology, to be held in Madrid, Spain, on July 26-             
              31, 1992. This meeting is convened once every four years and is                
              the largest international conference regularly held in the field               
              of Cell Biology. Funding is sought for scientists from the U.S. to             
              attend this meeting. The meeting provides a valuable forum for cell            
              biologists from different countries to meet, to discuss their                  
              research, and to initiate or cultivate research collaborations that            
              extend beyond national boundaries.                                             
                                                                                             
              Support is sought for U.S. scientists to attend the Fifth                      
              International Congress on Cell Biology. The meeting is to be held              
              in Madrid, Spain, from July 26th through July 31st, 1992. The                  
              meeting provides a valuable service in that it enables cell                    
              biologists from around the world to meet and discuss their                     
              research. It also can serve as a stepping stone for the initiation             
              of international research collaborations. The meeting is convened              
              once every four years, and is the largest international conference             
              that is regularly scheduled in the area of Cell Biology.
