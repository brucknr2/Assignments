Abstract    :
                   Consumer products often carry warranties which are either one-            
              dimensional (indexed by time in service or amount of usage) or two-            
              dimensional (indexed by both of these variables).  The focus of                
              this project is on two-dimensional warranties, virtually an                    
              unaddressed topic.                                                             
                   The warranty scenario raises at least two classes or research             
              issues:  the specification of an optimum price/warranty                        
              combination, and the forecast of a reserve fund to meet future                 
              claims.  The former is multidisciplinary, involving aspects of                 
              economics, game theory, marketing, operations research, and                    
              probabilistic modeling.  The latter involves the analysis of time              
              series and point processes in two dimensions, for which the use of             
              Bayesian methods is appropriate.  This project addresses the                   
              following aspects of these issues.                                             
                   1.  Formalization of the first issue to facilitate                        
              mathematical development of the individual pieces.                             
                   2.  Development of probabilistic models for the occurrence of             
              events (failures) indexed by time and usage.                                   
                   3.  Renewal theory for points in a plane generated by the                 
              models developed.                                                              
                   4.  Development of meaningful utility functions based on                  
              subjective probability considerations which describe the                       
              competitive behavior between manufacturers and consumers, and                  
              between manufacturers.                                                         
                   5.  Development of a technology for undertaking times series              
              analysis in two dimensions.                                                    
                   6.  Statistical inference for point processes in a plane.                 
                   Although all aspects of the project are motivated by the                  
              warranty problem, items 2, 3, 5, and 6 have scientific merit of                
              their own and will provide new tools for the decision sciences.
