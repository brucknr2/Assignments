Abstract    :
              The authors propose to use new submillimeter and millimeter                    
              observations of the Sun from the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope                 
              (JCMT) to model the low and middle chromospheres of sunspots and               
              magnetic flux tubes in plage.  This program will be a                          
              continuation of an exploratory solar program they recently                     
              completed to open the JCMT to solar research.  Under this                      
              program, the JCMT gave the authors the first submillimeter                     
              observations of the chromospheric supergranular network, of                    
              sunspots, and of prominences, opening these fundamental solar                  
              phenomena to the powerful LTE diagnostic tools of the far                      
              infrared continuum.  The new program will be based primarily on                
              analysis of the large amount of high-quality data already                      
              obtained.  However, further observations will also be made on the              
              JCMT.  These will include the development of improved mapping                  
              techniques, observations at longer wavelengths (out to 2 mm) and               
              observations of intensity variations due to oscillations and                   
              possibly fares, using SCUBA, the 100 element bolometer array                   
              under development at the JCMT.  The new program will also include              
              preliminary analysis of observations of the total solar eclipse                
              of 1991 July 11 over Mauna Kea.
