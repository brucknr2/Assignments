Abstract    :
              In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program                 
              of the Chemistry Division, Robert Dunbar of Case Western                       
              Reserve University will study the properties of gas-phase ions                 
              interacting with laser light using an ion cyclotron resonance                  
              ion trap.  "Medium-to-large" hydrocarbons, organometallic                      
              compounds, clusters, and complex ions are targets for study.                   
              Time-resolved photodissociation kinetics, measurement of                       
              radiative cooling rates of excited ions, infrared multiphoton                  
              dissociation kinetics, the determination of radiative                          
              association efficiencies and of partitioning of vibrational                    
              energy in the products of complex ion dissociation will all be                 
              examined.  The temperature dependence of some of these                         
              processes will be determined using an ion trap cooled to 77 K.                 
              Theoretical studies will be conducted dealing with infrared                    
              multiphoton dissociation and radiative association in                          
              conjunction with an expert versed in statistical mechanics.

              The development of the technique known as Ion Cyclotron                        
              Resonance Spectroscopy has enabled scientists to trap                          
              electrically charged atoms or molecules, known as ions, for                    
              relatively long times, on the order of seconds or longer.  With                
              such long storage times, various processes involving ions which                
              last up to seconds in time can now be studied more easily.                     
              Examples of such processes include the breakup of an ion after                 
              the absorption of light with just enough energy to sever the                   
              bonds between atoms (near-threshold photodissociation) and the                 
              emission of infrared radiation.  Professor Dunbar's work will                  
              allow him to study several of these "slow" chemical processes                  
              for a variety of fairly large molecular ions.
