Abstract    :
                 A member of the group of S-type lectins, variously known as                 
              CBP35, Mac-2, Laminin-Binding Protein, L-34, RL-29, etc., has been             
              shown to reside in the nucleus of mammalian cells.  This protein               
              was shown some years ago to be associated with a ribonucleoprotein             
              complex which was identified as hnRNP.  Pilot experiments will be              
              performed to address the possibility that the lectin is involved               
              in splicing of nuclear pre mRNA.                                               
                                                                                             
              The idea that a galactoside-binding lectin is involved in the                  
              splicing of pre mRNA is a highly speculative one, for which                    
              presently available evidence is thin.  If the proposed preliminary             
              experiments provide further support for the hypothesis, the results            
              would substantially alter current thinking in the areas of                     
              intracellular lectins and RNA processing.
