Abstract    :
                   Professor Farley will study the high resolution laser                     
              spectroscopy of negative molecular ions.  Rare species of ions,                
              normally difficult to produce in sufficient density to study,                  
              will be measured using a coaxial ion- and laser-beam spectrometer              
              placed at the center of an optical buildup cavity.                             
              Photofragmentation and autodetachment of the negative ions as a                
              function of optical excitation will lead to basic understanding                
              of the electron-nuclear coupling processes in negatively charged               
              molecular species.
