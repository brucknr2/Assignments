Abstract    :
                   This is a grant to support a professor and four graduate                  
              students in four separate activities.  The primary one                         
              involves the SMC experiment at CERN in Switzerland in which                    
              the spin properties of the neutron and proton are studied                      
              using a beam of polarized muons.  In another experiment, the                   
              Large Volume Detector (LVD) is being assembled in a large                      
              underground laboratory in Italy (Grand Sasso).  This                           
              experiment is intended to detect neutrinos from space, and to                  
              search for effects due to changes (oscillations) in their                      
              identities.  The other two activities involve technological                    
              developments in high temperature superconducting magnet design                 
              and in the production of devices capable of the detection of                   
              muons suitable for use in a new detector (GEM) to be used at                   
              the Superconducting Super Collider (SSC).
