Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Squall lines occur over most moist areas of the Earth.  In the            
              Great Plains of the United States, a large fraction of the growing             
              season precipitation comes from squall lines.  In addition, severe             
              weather is common with squall line systems.                                    
                   The Principal Investigator will continue research into the                
              structure of squall lines.  This will be both an observational and             
              numerical modeling effort using data collected during the North                
              Dakota Thunderstorm Project.  A particularly unique aspect of this             
              research is that a wide range of aircraft and remote sensing                   
              observations exist on the early stages of the squall lines                     
              lifetime.  This provides an opportunity to study the development of            
              a feature known as the rear inflow jet which has been shown to be              
              a dynamically important feature of squall lines.
