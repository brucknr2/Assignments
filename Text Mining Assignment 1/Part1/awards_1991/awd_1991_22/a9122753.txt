Abstract    :
              Nehorai         This research focuses on new theoretical and algorithmic 
              solutions to three problems in the general area of signal  modeling and system
              identification:  1.     a computationally-efficient high-order Yule-Walker
              estimator  and its adaptive counterpart;  2.     fitting rational transfer
              function models to frequency  response data; and  3.     hypothesis testing and
              detection with the optimal  instrumental variable method.
