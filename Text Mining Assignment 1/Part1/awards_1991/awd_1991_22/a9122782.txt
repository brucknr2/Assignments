Abstract    :
              Employment relationships across all sizes of firms were altered                
              since the 19th century, as wage-earners in America moved from                  
              small enterprises to large ones.  Simply put, there was                        
              transition from a spot market for labor to one of implicit and                 
              explicit contractual relations.  The purpose of this project is                
              analyze the dimensions of the changing relationship between firms              
              and workers and the implications of this changing relationship                 
              for the economy.  This research is particularly timely and                     
              important given the continuing and major restructuring of the                  
              American economy and the consequences this holds for American                  
              workers.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              The underlying thesis to be tested is that a chaotic labor                     
              market, in which workers often participated in nonproductive                   
              mobility, was replaced by one that grated labor property rights                
              in jobs and that more fully utilized the work force.  Labor                    
              unions, unemployment insurance, and other protection for labor                 
              fostered the change, but it was also brought about by other                    
              forces.  Various aspects of this evolution will be analyzed more               
              thoroughly such as unemployment and the wage structure across the              
              20th century.  In addition, several related issues will also be                
              studied including the returns to general and to specific human                 
              capital, the length of the employment relationship, the provision              
              of benefits, the inter-industry wage differential, and the impact              
              of immigration.  Some of the necessary data sets exist, but in                 
              addition a large sample of firm-level records will be assembled                
              to reveal details about worker-firm relationships during the 20th              
              century.
