Abstract    :
              This award is for support of a two year project to measure the                 
              Helium concentrations and isotope ratios, Potassium/Argon ratios,              
              and Krypton 81 ages in ice from the GISP2 core.  The helium                    
              program is a search for nulls and/or reversals of the Earth's                  
              magnetic field, which should leave a strong signal in the Helium               
              3 to Helium 4 ratios and the Helium 3 concentrations in ice core               
              Helium.  If a geomagnetic Helium event is recorded in the ice                  
              sheets, it will provide a world-wide traceable horizon in both                 
              Greenland and Antarctica, for model studies of ice flow and for                
              chronology.  The Potassium/Argon measurements are to study                     
              gravitational fractionation of gases in the firn.  The Krypton 81              
              dating will provide one of the first absolute ages on the GISP2                
              core.
