Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The unique length and time scales characteristic of suspensions of             
              charge stabilized polymer spheres are exploited to study the basic             
              equilibrium and nonequilibrium properties of strongly interacting              
              spherical particle systems.  Proposed experiments include optical              
              microscopy, light scattering intensity fluctuation spectroscopy,               
              laser trapping of particles, x-ray and neutron scattering, and                 
              digital image processing.  Nonequilibrium studies will focus on                
              shear induced structure changes in suspension samples which form               
              liquid-like and crystal-like structures in equilibrium, the                    
              dynamics of the crystallization process, and the glass transition.             
              Equilibrium studies will investigate local order, dynamics and                 
              phase transitions in one, two and three dimensions.  Theoretical               
              studies including analog and molecular dynamic computer simulation             
              will continue, support and extend work on local liquid structure,              
              and nonequilibrium behavior.
