Abstract    :
                   This is a cooperative agreement between the National Science              
              Foundation (NSF) and the American Mathematical Society for the                 
              purpose of providing an evaluation of the applicants for the NSF               
              Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships.  The                  
              American Mathematical Society will receive and organize the                    
              applications and convene a panel of distinguished mathematical                 
              scientists representing the American Mathematical Society, the                 
              Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, and the Institute              
              of Mathematical Statistics.  This panel will recommend a list of               
              applicants to the Division of Mathematical Sciences of NSF for                 
              fellowship awards.                                                             
                   The American Mathematical Society (AMS) is a nonprofit                    
              organization dedicated to the support of mathematical research                 
              and scholarship.  It is critical to the AMS and to NSF that there              
              be a continuing influx of mathematicians possessing the advanced               
              training and talent needed to keep the profession vital.  The                  
              Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowship Program                 
              helps develop this talent and serves to focus attention on this                
              need throughout the broad mathematical sciences community.
