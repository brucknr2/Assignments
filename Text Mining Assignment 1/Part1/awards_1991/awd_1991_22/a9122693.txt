Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program                 
              will help the Department of Chemistry at Wayne State University                
              acquire a 400 MHz NMR spectrometer which will be used in                       
              research by six major users engaged in chemical synthesis.  Of                 
              the six programs, four have active NSF grants.  Four of these                  
              organic chemistry projects involve the stereospecific synthesis                
              of natural product analogs of bioactive molecules which will                   
              require high field NMR to characterize complex products.  One                  
              of these will also use NMR to determine the structure of                       
              natural products isolated from marine organisms.  The inorganic                
              project will use variable temperature and multinuclear NMR to                  
              characterize new organometallic species and reactions.  The                    
              sixth project will use variable temperature NMR to study the                   
              kinetics of free radical reactions.                                            
                                                                                             
              Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy is the most                      
              powerful tool available to the chemist for the elucidation of                  
              the structure of molecules.  It is used to identify unknown                    
              substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within                 
              molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between                   
              molecules in solution.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR                         
              spectroscopy is essential to chemists who are carrying out                     
              frontier research.  The results from these NMR studies are                     
              useful in areas such as polymers and catalysis, and in biology.
