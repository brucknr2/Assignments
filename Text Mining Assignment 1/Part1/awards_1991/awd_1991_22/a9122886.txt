Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Many recent contributions to the econometrics literature have                  
              proposed and analyzed "plug-in" semiparametric estimators.  Such               
              estimators replace unknown density or regression functions by                  
              nonparametric estimators of those functions.  While theory states              
              that these nonparametric estimators are "better" because they are              
              able to capture all nuances in the structure of econometric                    
              relationships in large samples, this does not assure that they                 
              will always produce better answers in either small or moderately               
              sized samples.  In particular, since an infinite series expansion              
              must always be truncated, or a finite approximation region chosen              
              for a local average estimator, there is the real possibility that              
              nonparametric estimators can contain systematic biases, because                
              of their construction.  In other words, the remainder terms that               
              modern theorists easily show vanish in large samples could                     
              actually be large, and systematic in onerous ways.  This is a                  
              particularly dangerous possibility for econometric results, since              
              such semiparametric estimators could naturally be interpreted as               
              less biased than their more restricted parametric counterparts.                
              The contribution of this project comes from measuring the                      
              significance of the biases in these estimators and developing                  
              ways of correcting for them.                                                   
                                                                                             
              In particular, this research will show how derivatives or                      
              elasticities computed from local smoothing estimators display                  
              systematic downward bias.  As such, measured derivatives from                  
              kernel regression and kernel density estimators are too small on               
              average.  The project demonstrates how large such bias will                    
              typically be, and proves theoretically why such biases arise                   
              naturally.  Corrections for this bias are studied.  This work                  
              involves both theoretical development and computer simulation.                 
              The project also continues research on average derivative                      
              estimation, a particular semiparametric approach.  Questions to                
              be addressed include the calculation and implementation of                     
              optimal bandwidths for average derivatives, as well as how to                  
              measure discrete variable coefficients in index models.
