Abstract    :
              Mendel         In many practical signal processing problems, information is 
              often represented in two forms: one is a set of input-output data  pairs,
              obtained by measuring the outputs of the system for some  typical input
              signals; and, the other is a set of linguistic  descriptions about the system,
              often in the form of IF-THEN fuzzy  rules, from human experts who are very
              familiar with the behavior  of the system. This research is developing a
              general method to  combine both numerical input/output pairs and linguistic
              IF-THEN  rules into signal processing system design within the framework  of
              fuzzy system theory.  The objectives are to:  1.     theoretically justify the
              practical successes of fuzzy  systems;   2.     develop synthesis methods for
              fuzzy systems which use both  numerical and linguistic information; and  3.    
              apply these synthesis methods to signal processing problems,  such as
              time-series prediction, and subject these methods to  theoretical performance
              analyses.   An optimal design method for fuzzy systems which will match given 
              input-output pairs to arbitrary accuracy is also being developed.
