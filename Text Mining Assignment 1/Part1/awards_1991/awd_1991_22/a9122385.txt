Abstract    :
              This theoretical research grant is jointly funded by the Divisions             
              of Materials Research and Physics.  It provides support for four               
              researchers who are applying field theoretical techniques to a                 
              variety of condensed matter and particle systems.  Topics to be                
              studied lie in the following areas: low temperature physics                    
              including transport and thermodynamics of many-particle systems,               
              the quantum Hall effect, strongly correlated Fermi systems,                    
              mesoscopic systems, superconductivity and superfluidity; field                 
              theory; complex fluids; neutron stars; the early universe; and,                
              matter under extreme conditions.
