Abstract    :
              This is a renewed investigation of the trace constituents in arctic            
              aerosols, using the Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis (INAA)            
              technique.  The technique is extremely sensitive and powerful,                 
              capable of determining the concentration of about forty elements,              
              including many environmentally crucial ones such as aluminum, zinc,            
              arsenic and antimony that are present in very low concentrations.              
              As a first priority, this study will complete the analysis of                  
              filtered samples obtained by the Atmospheric Environment Services              
              of Canada on Ellesmere Island since 1980, and secondarily will                 
              analyze samples obtained at Mould Bay and Igloolik during the                  
              winter/spring transition.                                                      
                                                                                             
              The occurrence of arctic haze, the general term for aerosol                    
              concentrations in the lower troposphere, reaches a seasonal maximum            
              in late winter when it becomes widespread through the arctic.  The             
              variation is the result both of seasonal differences in the                    
              northward transport, and in the removal process through wet and dry            
              deposition.  Multivariate factor analysis, potential source                    
              contribution functions, and time series analyses, combined with air            
              mass trajectories will provide advective patterns that will refine             
              our understanding of the transport mechanism and atmospheric                   
              pathways from the source regions to the Canadian Arctic, and allow             
              the investigations of trends in the relative composition of the                
              arctic aerosol trace constituents.
