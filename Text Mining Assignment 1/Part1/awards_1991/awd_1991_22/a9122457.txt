Abstract    :
                   This research investigates the relationship between vehicle               
              design, crash characteristics, infrastructure, and driver                      
              attributes using current databases; the structure of the accident              
              causation-consequence system via fault-tree analysis; and                      
              optimization of vehicle design criteria to minimize the risk of                
              injury and fatality when constraints on fuel economy, cost, and                
              convenience are recognized.  The study will enable structuring                 
              and classification of knowledge about accident causation and                   
              crash management using quantitative risk analysis tools and                    
              methodologies, and allow identification of knowledge gaps that                 
              are preventing a more complete understanding of the complex                    
              highway transportation system.  Decision models resulting from                 
              this work will aid the automobile industry in the selection of                 
              the optimal crash-avoidance measure under resource constraints in              
              a timely yet market-focused and cost effective manner.                         
                                                                                             
                   Several features of the proposed decision making framework                
              include the consideration of the multiple conflicting and                      
              noncommensurable objectives in the optimal design process; the                 
              allowance of the impact analysis on multiple injury levels and on              
              various consumer groups; and the recognition of complex system                 
              interactions.  To achieve the stated objectives two sources of                 
              expertise will be used:  From academic research recently                       
              developed and/or enhanced engineering design methodologies                     
              including fault-tree analysis, multiobjective and trade-off                    
              analysis, and optimal resource allocation will be used.                        
              Industrial research will contribute an understanding of the                    
              biomechanical responses to the physical characteristics of                     
              various energy-absorbing materials.
