Abstract    :
              In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program                 
              of the Chemistry Division, Professor Lester Andrews of the                     
              University of Virginia will investigate the matrix isolation                   
              spectroscopy of some exotic chemical species.  Systems to be                   
              examined in this work include metal atom complexes having                      
              pi-electron systems, metal complexes with carboranes,                          
              transition metal hydride or dihydrogen complexes, transition                   
              metal complexes involving carbon monoxide and molecular                        
              hydrogen as model Fischer-Tropsch catalysts, aluminum atom                     
              reactions with small molecules, and heavy Group VA and VIA atom                
              chemistry.  A pulsed-laser evaporation method will be used in                  
              many of these experiments to form the metal complexes, while                   
              microwave discharges will be used to make metal clusters.                      
              Infrared and electronic absorption and resonance Raman                         
              spectroscopy are among the experimental tools to be used.                      
              %%%                                                                            
              Professor Andrews uses the technique of matrix isolation                       
              spectroscopy to study the structure of molecules which are so                  
              unstable that they normally are not observed under ordinary                    
              laboratory conditions.  In this technique, the species of                      
              interest are generated and then quickly trapped at very low                    
              temperatures in frozen rare gas matrices.  Included among                      
              species studied are the intermediates formed in chemical                       
              reactions, weakly-bound molecules, or highly reactive forms.                   
              Such molecules are difficult or impossible to characterize by                  
              other experimental techniques.
