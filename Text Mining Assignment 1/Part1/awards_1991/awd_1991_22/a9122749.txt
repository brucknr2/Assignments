Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
                                         ABSTRACT                                            
                                                                                            
              Every syntactic theory must explain the way human languges align               
              semantic roles with syntactic relations.  Human languages                      
              consistently map the 'agent' roles associated with the actions                 
              'cut', 'give' and 'see' into the same syntactic relations,                     
              despite significant cross-linguistic differences in case                       
              morphology, configurationality and the optional expression of                  
              verb arguments.  Until recently linguists have only issued                     
              promissory notes in the form of loosely defined semantic roles to              
              account for cross-linguistic regularities in alignment as well as              
              a host of other syntactic phenomena.  It has long been recognized              
              that such accounts remain promissory until linguists, working                  
              within various theoritical frameworks, have begun to investigate               
              the way in which semantic roles reflect or derive from the                     
              conceptual structure of events.  Current research on language                  
              acquisition also focuses on the significance of                                
              semantic/syntactic alignment for the acquisition of language.                  
              This conference will enable these researchers to critically                    
              examine the nature of semantic roles and their role in syntactic               
              theory and language acquistion.
