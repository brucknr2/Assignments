Abstract    :
                   A differential algebraic equation (DAE) is an implicit                    
              ordinary differential equation of the form F(y,y,u(t),t)=0 where               
              y(t) is a vector valued function, the Jacobian F y is a singular               
              matrix, and u(t) is a vector valued function of source or control              
              terms.  Many problems are most naturally initially modeled as a                
              DAE.  They arise, for example, in a variety of control problems                
              in flight control, robotics, chemical process control, and                     
              contact or constrained problems in mechanics.  In addition,                    
              differential algebraic equations occur in the solution of partial              
              differential equations by the method of lines and in many circuit              
              models.  DAEs are sometimes also called singular or descriptor                 
              systems.                                                                       
                   The long range goal of the proposed research is for                       
              scientists and engineers to be able to work directly with the                  
              original implicit model thus reducing design and simulation time               
              as well as facilitating the consideration of more complex                      
              problems.  Existing numerical codes, while very useful, require                
              special problem structure and do not handle many problems of                   
              interest.  This project will develop a general numerical method                
              for nonlinear differential algebraic equations.  These results                 
              will also be of interest when explicit models exist, but the                   
              sparsity, nonlinearity, or dependence on parameters of the                     
              equations, make the original implicit system preferable to a                   
              lower order, but non-sparse, (or difficult to compute local)                   
              explicit system.
