Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The field of research supported by this award is that of stellar               
              populations in globular clusters and elliptical galaxies.  Dr.                 
              Roger Bell and Dr. Michael Tripicco at the University of Maryland              
              will continue to work on the generation of integrated spectra of               
              globular clusters and galaxies.  The method used is unique in that             
              Drs. Bell and Tripicco build the integrated spectra from synthetic             
              stellar spectra, theoretical isochrones, and mass functions, and               
              they are guided by observed cluster color-magnitude diagrams and               
              luminosity functions.  In test cases, the agreement between the                
              model and observation is extremely encouraging, but improvements               
              are planned.
