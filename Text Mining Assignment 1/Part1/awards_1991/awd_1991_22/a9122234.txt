Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  In this research conference proposal, the aim is to convene               
              a meeting of plant and animal scientists to present current                    
              findings and to discuss a broad range of issues that pertain to the            
              structure and function of plasmodesmata in the context of                      
              intercellular transport. Activity on plasmodesmata has recently                
              intensified, and this meeting will serve to focus the current group            
              toward important issues, to attract new researchers into this area,            
              and to provide workers in related fields with an assessment of                 
              progress. The meeting proceedings are to be published in a                     
              compendium volume.                                                             
                                                                                             
              Intercellular transport of ions and small molecules in higher                  
              plants occurs through plasmodesmata. The fine structure of these               
              cytoplasmic links between adjacent cells has been under discussion             
              since the early days of electron microscopy, yet the plasmodesmata             
              remain a black box through which various substances move from cell             
              to cell. Recently, research on plasmodesmata has intensified. This             
              conference focuses on this new work and aims to provide scientists             
              working in this field with an opportunity to describe their work               
              and its meaning in the context of intercellular transport in                   
              plants.
