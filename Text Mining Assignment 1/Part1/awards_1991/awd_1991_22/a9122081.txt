Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research program is directed towards improved understanding of            
              first-order phase transformations based on examination of the                  
              martensitic phase transformation.  The program employs both                    
              theoretical and experimental approaches to address two broad areas:            
              (a) the distributed-activation kinetics of heterogeneous                       
              nucleation; and (b) competing transformation mechanisms in                     
              nonlinear nonlocal solids.  General features of distributed-                   
              activation heterogeneous kinetics are examined in nucleation                   
              kinetic experiments employing acoustic emission and sterological               
              measurements in both thermoelastic and nonthermoelastic martensitic            
              systems, defining potency distributions of initial and                         
              autocatalytic defects.  principles are extended to bainitic                    
              transformations and solidification.  Competing mechanisms of                   
              structural transformation are examined by combined theory and                  
              experiment in model systems describable by nonlinear nonlocal                  
              continuum models predicting interfacial energies.  Experiments test            
              predicted behavior of a new transformation mechanism,                          
              quasimartensitic strain modulation, which competes with nucleation             
              and growth under conditions near a lattice instability.

              This analytical and experimental work is directed to martensitic               
              transformations found in steels, for instance, but is applicable to            
              other phase transformations in metals and ceramics.
