Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 project is              
              in the general area of infrared (IR) spectrometry in the subfield              
              of chemical analysis.  This project will develop linear detector               
              arrays for application to infrared spectroscopy.  The availability             
              of these uncooled arrays will lead to the development of a new                 
              generation of IR spectrometers.  The advantages associated with                
              array-based instruments (no moving parts, high measurement speed,              
              ruggedness, and reduced cost) will then be extended to the infrared            
              region of the spectrum.  In Phase I, single element detectors were             
              fabricated using thin film deposition and etching techniques.                  
              These broadband bolometers incorporate recently-developed high                 
              temperature-coefficient of resistance films, absorber layers and               
              ultra-thin substrates.  Measured detectivities (at 15 Hz) are three            
              times higher than observed in the best commercially available                  
              uncooled IR detectors.  In Phase II, research will concentrate on              
              fabricating and testing linear detector arrays of high performance.

              This research has the potential of allowing spectrometer builders              
              to reach the goal of a compact mid-infrared spectrometer with no               
              moving parts having high stability and reliability.  This would be             
              of great value in education and technology.
