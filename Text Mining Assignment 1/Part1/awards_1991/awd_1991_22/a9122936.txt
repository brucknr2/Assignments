Abstract    :
                   Phylogenetic analysis is critical to an evolutionary                      
              understanding of any character distribution, including that of                 
              sexuality, and yet there has been no concerted effort to apply                 
              phylogenetic methods to studying the evolution of sex.                         
                   This study will examine the phylogenies of two related groups             
              of South American weevils that consist primarily of parthenogenetic            
              species.  Morphological evidence indicates that each group includes            
              a speciose clade that is primitively parthenogenetic.  The study               
              will rely primarily on mitochondrial DNA sequences for phylogenetic            
              analysis.  Flow cytometry and allozyme data will be used to confirm            
              the distribution of parthenogenesis and to provide additional data             
              on relationships among clones.  The ages of parthenogenetic clades             
              and their origination and extinction rates will be estimated using             
              DNA sequence data.                                                             
                   This study will lay the groundwork for testing theories of sex            
              using parthenogenetic weevils; it aims to serve as a model for a               
              much-needed program of phylogenetic research into the evolutionary             
              biology of sex.
