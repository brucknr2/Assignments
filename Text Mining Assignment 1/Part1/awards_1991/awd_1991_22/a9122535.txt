Abstract    :
              At a recent Microelectronics and Information Processing Systems                
              (MIPS) Advisory Committee meeting, it was recommended that a Signal            
              Processing Workshop be held to meet several goals.  The Division               
              Director of MIPS pointed out to the Advisory Committee that NSF                
              needed help from the research community in developing both a short             
              term and a long term vision for the area of signal processing.  The            
              short term vision would identify promising areas of research having            
              high pay-offs in terms of research results and industrial                      
              relevances.  The long term vision would examine general trends in              
              signal processing, and determine if investments should be made in              
              these areas.  This proposal is designed to address the above needs.            
               A side benefit will be to introduce the new Circuits and Signal               
              Processing Program Director to key people in a broad range of areas            
              of signal processing.
