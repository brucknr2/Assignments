Abstract    :
              This project centers on continued development of the Rice                      
              Convection Model (RCM) to study the Earth's magnetosphere and its              
              coupling to the ionosphere and thermosphere.  This three-year                  
              project concentration on eliminating the fundamental shortcoming               
              of the present RCM, namely the inconsistency between the pressure              
              distribution computed by the RCM from adiabatic-convection theory              
              and the magnetic forces implied by the inputted magnetic-field                 
              model.  A new algorithm will be developed for fast calculation of              
              3d magnetic fields that are approximately consistent with RCM-                 
              computed pressure distributions.  The first convection-model                   
              calculation with approximately self-consistent B will asssume                  
              steady inputs, no near-Earth neutral line, and no other major                  
              non-adiabatic processes.  The second self-consistent calculation               
              will represent a classic, idealized magnetospheric substorm,                   
              including a growth phase, an expansion phase with disruption of                
              the near-tail plasma sheet, and a recovery phase with                          
              reconstitution of the plasma sheet.  Work will continue on other               
              RCM investigations, including penetration of magnetospheric                    
              electric fields to low ionospheric latitudes, transport of ring-               
              current/radiation-belt particles, and magnetic-field-aligned                   
              electric fields.  Work applying the RCM to plasma transport in                 
              the Jovian magnetosphere will be pursued, though at a rate that                
              depends on the prospects for appropriate data from the Galileo                 
              mission.
