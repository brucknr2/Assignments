Abstract    :
                   The nuclear physics research program at a predominantly                   
              undergraduate institution, Oberlin College, is supported by                    
              this grant.  The investigator and his students will study the                  
              nuclear reactions and structure of light radioactive nuclei                    
              and stable lithium isotopes using facilities at the National                   
              Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory and Notre Dame                            
              University.
