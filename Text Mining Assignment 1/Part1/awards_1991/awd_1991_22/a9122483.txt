Abstract    :
              Managers must know how to help individuals make technological                  
              transitions without detriment to productivity and well-being.                  
              The purpose of this Research Planning Grant is to support the                  
              investigator in completing preliminary activities necessary to                 
              develop a long-term program of research on the process of                      
              technological change and the worker/task interface.  During the                
              project development phase, survey instruments will be refined and              
              possible research sites will be evaluated.
