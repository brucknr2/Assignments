Abstract    :
              Embryology and developmental biology are increasingly                          
              prominent in modern evolutionary biology.  Many                                
              advocates of the importance of development argue that                          
              the processes of organic growth produce constraints on                         
              adaptive evolution.  This approach contrasts with                              
              "adaptationism," a feature of mainstream neo-Darwinian                         
              evolutionary biology that emphasizes natural selection                         
              and the particular adaptations-to-environment it                               
              produces.  Adaptationism is said by its critics to                             
              ignore the structural processes of development which                           
              are common to large groups of organisms and which                              
              produce non-adaptational similarities.  Dr. Amundson is                        
              examining the methodological basis of the adaptation-                          
              versus-constraint debates from an historical                                   
              perspective.  A remarkably similar debate occurred                             
              among pre-Darwinian British biologists, between natural                        
              theologians and continental style morphologists and                            
              comparative anatomists.  Comparisons between the two                           
              debates suggest that the contrast between adaptational                         
              and structural biological explanation is not a special                         
              feature of evolutionary biology at all.  The                                   
              methodological similarities will contribute to a better                        
              understanding of the current debates and a better                              
              understanding of the diverse explanatory strategies                            
              used in biological science.
