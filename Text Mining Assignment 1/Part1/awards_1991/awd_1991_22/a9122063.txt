Abstract    :
                   The proposal seeks partial funding (50% cost share) for the               
              publication of a monograph revising the systematics of two genera              
              of scleractinian corals within the Caribbean region during                     
              Neogene time.  The monograph has been reviewed and formally                    
              accepted by the Bulletins of American Paleontology as a separate               
              volume in part of a series on the Neogene Paleontology of the                  
              northern Dominican Republic.  Its contents provide a detailed                  
              documentation of the protocol and rationale underlying                         
              morphometric analyses performed in research funded by NSF grant                
              no. BSR 8605277.  The monograph is unique in being one of the                  
              first systematic treatments in reef corals to use a rigorous                   
              quantitative approach in the recognition of species, as well as                
              in tracing the distributions of morphospecies through space and                
              time.  A total of nine species are recognized altogether,                      
              resulting in the synonymy of five of 16 previously reported                    
              species in the Caribbean Neogene.  Only three of these species                 
              are found to have survived until the Recent, and only two to                   
              extend back into Oligocene time.
