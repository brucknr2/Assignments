Abstract    :
              The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), under a new              
              mandate received from the World Meteorological Organization and the            
              United Nations Environment Programme, will provide near-term scientific        
              and technical advice to the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee            
              (INC) which was established by the United Nations to develop a                 
              framework convention on climate change.  The IPCC will also continue           
              its ongoing efforts with respect to assessment of the science, impacts         
              and response options associated with climate change.  The IPCC will            
              continue to work primarily through its Working Groups; will broaden            
              participation in these activities by developing countries, particularly        
              in the tropics and Southern Hemisphere; and will continue to be staffed        
              by a small secretariat located in Geneva.
