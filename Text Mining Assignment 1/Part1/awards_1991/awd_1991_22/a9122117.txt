Abstract    :
                   Theoretical studies of the scattering of electrons from                   
              one and two electron targets are proposed.  Investigations                     
              include the calculation of differential cross sections and                     
              angle and spin dependent correlation functions for the n=2 and                 
              n=3 levels of hydrogen, impact ionization of hydrogen, rate                    
              coefficients for excitation of hydrogenic ions, elastic and                    
              inelastic scattering of electrons by He and the profiles of                    
              spectral lines of hydrogen like ions in a plasma.
