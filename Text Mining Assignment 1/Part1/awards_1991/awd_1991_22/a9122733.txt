Abstract    :
              This research involves an in-depth investigation of the American               
              public's perceptions of an feelings toward Congress.  Popular                  
              accounts frequently stress the public's unhappiness with Congress,             
              but the sources of this unhappines and variations across the                   
              population in levels of unhappiness are seldom analyzed with                   
              care.  Given the importance of public attitudes toward political               
              institutions like Congress, and given the potential for unhappiness            
              to be translated into reforms with serious implications, such as               
              term limitations, it is essential that a deeper systematic                     
              appreciation of of public sentiments is obtained.                              
                                                                                             
              In this research investigation, the researchers employ both a                  
              national telephone survey and intensive focus group interviews to              
              probe systematically the nature of the American public's beliefs               
              about Congress; beliefs such as what the institution should be                 
              doing, what it is doing, and whether reforms are needed to bring               
              expectations and reality into line.  As such, this research                    
              provides a unique social science data base on perceptions of                   
              Congress and its members.  Analysis of these data helps to lay the             
              foundation for a theory of public attitudes toward, not just                   
              Congress, but political institutions generally.
