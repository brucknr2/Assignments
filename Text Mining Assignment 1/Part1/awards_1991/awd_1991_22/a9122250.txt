Abstract    :
                      This award will  partially support the travel of                       
              approximately 16 scientists from the United States to attend the               
              16th International Biometric Conference, which is to be held 7-11              
              December, 1992 in Hamilton, New Zealand.  The strength of the                  
              meetings lies in the broad international participation of                      
              statisticians, biologists, and mathematicians interested in                    
              quantitative and statistical aspects of biology, genetics,                     
              envirnomental science, and other fields.  Topics to be discussed               
              on statistical areas directly related to these issues include                  
              survival analysis, epidemiology, genetics, molecular biology,                  
              environmental pollution monitoring, modeling metabolism and                    
              pharmacokinetics;  all of which have direct bearing on solutions               
              to the major concerns of today including AIDS, cancer and heart                
              diseases, plant science epidemiology and agriculture.  In                      
              addition, discussions on fundamental statistical issues of                     
              repeated measures, structural inference, image processing and                  
              causal inference all have direct application to current health                 
              related and agricultural sciences.  It is anticipated that the                 
              Conference, which is the major international meeting of                        
              biostatisticians and biometricians throughout the world will be                
              attended by 500 or more scientists from the international                      
              community.                                                                     
                   This award will  partially support the travel of                          
              approximately 16 scientists from the United States to attend the               
              16th International Biometric Conference, which is to be held 7-11              
              December, 1992 in Hamilton, New Zealand.  The strength of the

              quantitative and statistical aspects of biology, genetics,                     
              environmental sciences, and other fields.
