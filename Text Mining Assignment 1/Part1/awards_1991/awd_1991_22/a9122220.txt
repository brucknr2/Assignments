Abstract    :
              Dr. Kargon is undertaking a pilot project to put the papers,                   
              letters, film and audio archives of J. Robert Oppenheimer on two               
              CD-ROM disks to be made available at low cost to libraries and                 
              individual scholars around the world.  Under this grant, they are:             
              (1) transferring the Oppenheimer papers, along with audio and                  
              visual material, to two CD-ROM disks, accessible upon a wide range             
              of computer platforms;  (2) including on the disks a complete                  
              Oppenheimer bibliography and selected secondary works (subject to              
              copyright arrangements);  (3) identifying the necessary software               
              to enable researchers to scan, search and view the materials;  and             
              (4) assessing the feasibility and costs of the new process in a                
              full report of the pilot project, so that the techniques they                  
              develop can be widely disseminated for future development.
