Abstract    :
              This project, funded by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organo-                
              metallic Chemistry Program, is divided into five areas:                        
              1) reductive coupling of linear ligands (CO, CNR, etc.) by                     
              early transition metal compounds, 2) chemistry of recently                     
              discovered paramagnetic, trigonal bipyramidal cobalt(III)                      
              complexes, and especially possible alkyl derivatives,                          
              3) conjugate addition chemistry employing new copper and silver                
              coordination complexes as catalysts, 4) metal complexes of                     
              binucleating phosphand ligands (macrocyclic ligands in which                   
              some donors are phosphorus), and 5) oxidative coupling                         
              reactions, especially of water, in polymetallic oxo complexes.

              The research to be performed in this project is concerned with                 
              the fundamental structures and reactivities of inorganic and                   
              organometallic compounds.  Knowledge obtained here will likely                 
              impact on a number of areas including catalysis, synthesis of                  
              fine chemicals, reaction mechanisms of biological molecules and                
              solar energy conversion.
