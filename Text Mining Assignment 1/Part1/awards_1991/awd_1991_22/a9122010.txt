Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project supports the dissertation research of a cultural                  
              anthropology student in Soviet Armenia. The student will                       
              interview residents of two Soviet Armenian villages where local                
              and diasporan Armenians are collaborating in reconstruction                    
              projects following the 1988 earthquake.  The project will study                
              how the rebuilding reflects local conceptions of national                      
              Armenian identity in the current changing macro-political context              
              of a dissolved Soviet Union.  Using participant observation,                   
              residential surveys, and formal interviews, the student will see               
              how plain citizens as well as architects and developers express                
              Armenian identity in their construction plans.                                 
                                                                                             
              This research is important because knowledge of the nationalist                
              feelings and values of Eastern European peoples is critically                  
              important at this time in history, as the Soviet empire reduces                
              its scope.
