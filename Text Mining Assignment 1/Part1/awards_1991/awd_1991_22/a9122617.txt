Abstract    :
              A symposium entitled use of Low-Copy Number Nuclear Markers in the             
              Study of Plant Evolution will be held August 10, 1992, at the 39th             
              annual American Institute of Biological Sciences (AIBS) conference             
              in Honolulu, Hawaii in conjunction with the American Society of                
              Plant Taxonomists.  This symposium will foster interdisciplinary               
              contact among scientists from genetics, agriculture and plant                  
              biology allowing a free flow of ideas on applying the latest                   
              available techniques for advancing the study of phylogenetic and               
              population biology.  The selected speakers represent a broad range             
              of disciplines and should attract a diverse audience of plant                  
              biologists.  Six presentations will be made:  (1) Dr. Tim                      
              Helentjaris--Use of RFLP and PCR strategies to understand the                  
              evolution of the maize genome; (2) Dr. Paul Keim--Genetic analysis             
              of hybrid plants: biotic and abiotic factors result in genetically             
              structured populations; (3) Dr. Thomas Osborn--Evolution of                    
              Brassica nuclear genomes; (4) Dr. Loren Rieseberg--Genomic                     
              consequences of diploid hybrid speciation in Helianthus                        
              (Asteraceae); (5) Dr. Barbara Schaal--Minisatellite DNA variation              
              in native plant populations; (6) Dr. Jonathan Wendel--RFLP                     
              diversity in cotton.
