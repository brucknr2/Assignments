Abstract    :
              A study of the synthesis and reactivity of highly strained                     
              allenes will be conducted. The proposed investigation will                     
              include studies of cumulene photochemistry, asymmetric                         
              photochemical processes, photogeneration of carbenes, and                      
              photoinduced reactions to give highly strained allenes. A major                
              objective is to develop general synthetic methods for the                      
              generation of strained dienes and trienes. The identity and                    
              reactivity of the highly strained intermediates will be                        
              detected by use of matrix isolation methods and transient                      
              spectroscopy. In addition, attempts to make high molecular                     
              weight cyclic-type polymers will be conducted via pathways                     
              involving strained intermediates.

              This grant from the Organic dynamics Program supports the work                 
              of Professor Richard P. Johnson at the University of New                       
              Hampshire. These investigations will be aimed at the synthesis                 
              of highly strained organic molecules that are expected to                      
              undergo a variety of quite unusual reactions. By the                           
              development of general methods for the synthesis of such                       
              species, it should be possible to produce a variety of                         
              compounds which are currenty impossible to generate by any                     
              other process. The highly reactive strained ring species live                  
              for only very short periods of time and therefore specialized                  
              techniques are required to prove their existence.
