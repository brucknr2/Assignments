Abstract    :
              This project involves a series of experiments to study the effects             
              of monetary incentives on the performance of a mental arithmetic               
              "production" task.  The nature of the contingencies will be varied             
              to create an experimental design comparing the effects of large,               
              medium, and small monetary payoffs in piece rate, variable ratio,              
              quota, and tournament incentive schemes, including flat hourly wage            
              conditions.  To a much greater extent than in previous research, we            
              will measure the effects of incentive scheme contingency and size              
              of monetary award on the fine-grained structure of behavior.  It is            
              expected that the results of this systematic study will lead to                
              well-calibrated tasks which can be used in other experimental                  
              studies of incentive effects which should yield to greater                     
              generalizability of research findings.
