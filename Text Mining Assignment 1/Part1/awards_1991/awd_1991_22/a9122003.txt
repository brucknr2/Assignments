Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The objective of this project is to investigate the role of                    
              segment-solvent and segment-cosolvent hydrogen bonding on the                  
              phase behavior of ethylene-based copolymer solutions.  The                     
              approach used to reach this objective is to experimentally                     
              investigate the phase behavior of solutions which consist of                   
              polar/nonpolar, statistically random copolymers with polar and                 
              nonpolar solvents and cosolvents.  The polarity and hydrogen                   
              bonding capabilities of the copolymers will be systematically                  
              varied by controlling the concentration of nonpolar and polar                  
              groups in the polymer backbone.  The solvents will vary from                   
              the low-molecular-weight, nonpolar hydrocarbons to highly                      
              polar, hydrogen bonding hydrocarbons.  Cosolvents such as                      
              dimethyl ether and ethanol will be used with the nonpolar                      
              solvents to determine the importance of hydrogen bonding and                   
              polarity on the phase behavior.  Cloud-point curves and binary                 
              and ternary phase diagrams will be constructed at temperatures                 
              up to 448 K and at pressures up to 275 MPa--conditions which                   
              also bracket the free-radical polymerization process that is                   
              used for ethylene-based copolymers.  The data will be modeled                  
              using the Sanchez-Lacombe equation of state in its present                     
              form and in a form revised to explicitly account for hydrogen                  
              bonding.
