Abstract    :
              The purpose of this project is to isolate and analyze the                      
              economic consequences of the Marshall Plan.  Remarkably enough,                
              there does not exist a single, systematic study analyzing the                  
              economic impact of the Marshall Plan, despite the fact it was one              
              of the great successes of American foreign policy in restoring                 
              the economic strength of Europe after World War II.  This                      
              research is particularly timely given the break up of the Soviet               
              Empire and the current debate about how best to construct an                   
              economic assistance program by the Western Democracies.  The                   
              findings of this project could provide useful insights as to how               
              an aid program might be structured.                                            
                                                                                             
              Specifically, the project will take three approaches to analyzing              
              the impact on economic growth of U.S. aid to Europe after World                
              War II.  The first, an aggregate approach, will develop an                     
              analytic framework that takes as its point of departure the two-               
              gap literature in development economics.  An empirical model of                
              the channels through which the Marshall Plan affected aggregate                
              output growth will be developed and estimated for the period 1945              
              to 1955.  The second is a sectorial approach which will use                    
              input-output tables and data on aid-financed commodity imports to              
              assess the role of the Marshall Plan in removing sectorial                     
              bottlenecks.  The third is political economy approach which will               
              develop and use models of collective decision-making to analyze                
              the allocation of U.S. aid.
