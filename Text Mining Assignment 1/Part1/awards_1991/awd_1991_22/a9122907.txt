Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Lack of fitness due to drugs and alcohol has been implicated in                
              recent calamities (oil spills, subway crashes).  Bioassays (of                 
              body fluids, hair clippings, etc.) can establish whether or not                
              certain chemicals were ingested at some point in time prior to                 
              the accident, but beg the question of whether performance itself               
              was degraded.  A performance-based assessment method would permit              
              more direct evidence of fitness potential in the workplace and,                
              once instituted, could be expected to improve productivity.                    
              Since tests are not actual jobs, a method is need for indexing                 
              change which provides a context or standard tied to the jobs                   
              themselves.  Phase I demonstrated the feasibility of using                     
              alcohol dosage as an indexing standard and multivariate dose-                  
              equivalency equations were created to permit the "dialing in" of               
              a set alcohol equivalency level, so that combinations of                       
              performance loss which met that level could be "flagged."  Also,               
              sensitivity in a field setting was shown using a commercial                    
              airline pilot on several transoceanic flights involving multiple               
              time-zone changes, and an algorithm was developed to "tune"                    
              (minimize) false positive errors.  Plans for Phase II are to                   
              establish further job relevancy and improved sensitivity (i.e.,                
              hit ratio) of the tests as well as minimizing false positives.
