Abstract    :
              This project is a collaborative research effort                                
              between the University of Minnesota, the                                       
              University of Texas at Austin, and the                                         
              University of Washington for an experimental                                   
              and analytical investigation of beam-column                                    
              connections in precast concrete ductile-joint                                  
              frames under the PRESSS Phase II                                               
              Coordinated Research Program.  The                                             
              experimental research is divided into three                                    
              phases of tests:  (1) connection components,                                   
              (2) beam-column subassemblages, and (3)                                        
              multibay subassemblages.                                                       
                                                                                             
              The first phase of testing investigates a series                               
              of components or connecting elements that are                                  
              common among many of the connections                                           
              currently under consideration by the PRESSS                                    
              Phase I Program.  Beam-column connection                                       
              subassemblage tests will be used to investigate                                
              at least three types of beam-column frame                                      
              connections to be detailed by PRESSS Phase I                                   
              researchers.                                                                   
                                                                                             
              Results of the tests will be used to develop                                   
              analytical models to represent connection                                      
              behavior.  The end result of this project will be                              
              the development of recommendations for the                                     
              design of precast concrete ductile beam-                                       
              column-floor panel connections and  detailing                                  
              guidelines for shear transfer at the interface of                              
              and through joint regions.
