Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  How much and what kinds of inequality should a society have?              
              This is one of the most basic questions for comparative social                 
              stratification research.  This project will collect data on social             
              inequality from respondents to the 1991 General Social Survey (the             
              major data collection supported in the field of sociology) as part             
              of the International Social Science Program, a continuing annual               
              program of cross-national collaboration .  The 1992 social                     
              inequality module replicates and extends the 1987 social inequality            
              module which was fielded in 10 countries.  In 1992, data collection            
              is expected in 20 countries.  These data will form the basis of                
              cross-national comparisons, cross-time comparisons, and intra-                 
              individual comparisons.  The social inequality module measures                 
              beliefs and perceptions regarding social inequality in general and             
              income differences in particular.  It examines 1) factors people               
              believe influence social mobility, such as parental background,                
              education, personal qualities, and fixed personal attributes; 2)               
              reasons for social inequality, such as a reward for occupations                
              with greater responsibility or requiring more education, elite                 
              domination, and exploitation; 3) beliefs as to what people earn in             
              selected occupations and what they should earn; 4) support for                 
              government measures to provide for social welfare and promote                  
              income levelling; 5) the degree of social conflict between classes             
              and economic groups; 6) inter-generational changes in occupation,              
              education, and standard of living; 7) what factors should determine            
              wage differentials; and 8) whether a respondent would personally               
              benefit from a measure to equalize income.                                     
                                                                                             
                   The project will contribute high-quality data that will create            
              an unprecedented opportunity in the study of social stratification             
              for linking knowledge of employment contexts, asked as a part of               
              the 1991 General Social Survey, with information about inequality.             
              The data collection will also make a contribution in the context               
              of the growing internationalization of sociological research.
