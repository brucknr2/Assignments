Abstract    :
                   The principal investigators will explore various variational              
              criteria for the existence and stability of equilibria and steady              
              motions of mechanical systems in contexts where traditional                    
              approaches do not exist or are not completely understood. They                 
              will try to derive conditions under which formal instability                   
              accurately predicts linear instability in the presence of very                 
              small damping. Another objective is the development of a                       
              systematic approach to the stability and bifurcation analysis of               
              symmetric states in phase space.                                               
                   This award will support research in the general area of                   
              dynamical systems. A process which is very simple and easy to                  
              understand locally can become extremely complicated, nonlinear,                
              and difficult to analyze globally. Dynamical systems is the study              
              of this local to global relationship. Many physical systems can                
              best be modeled using this area of mathematics including fluid                 
              flow and turbulence, complex biological systems, mechanical                    
              systems, and chemical reactions.
