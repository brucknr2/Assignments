Abstract    :
                This project investigates the geometric structure and  develops efficient
              geometric algorithms for the following   areas:  (1)  Arrangements and
              configurations, including the   complexity of a  single cell, zones and
              envelopes, space partitions, and   of lines in space;  (2)  Geometric
              algorithms for robot motion planning,   including motion  planning for various
              systems with 3 degrees of freedom,   planning based on generalized voronoi
              diagrams in 3 space,   extremal placements and high-clearance motion;  (3) 
              Visibility problems in three dimensions, including   output-sensitive   hidden
              surface removal, and ray shooting and tracing;  (4)  Randomized techniques in
              geometry, including design and   of randomized geometric algorithms,
              epsilon-nets, and   of geometric algorithms; and  (5)  Applications and related
              problems, including k-sets in  arrangements, union of geometric objects,
              geometric   optimization,  layout of graphs in the plane, incidence and
              distance   problems, and  transversal problems.  A theme in many of the
              investigated research areas is the   study of  problems in higher dimensional
              space and involving curved   (rather than flat objects in 2 or 3 dimensions). 
              Such    problems are  much harder to tackle than problems traditionally studied
              in  computational geometry, but are essential for many   applications (such  as
              those mentioned above).  Another theme is the rich cross-fertilization between
              basic   in computational geometry and the various application areas,   problems
              in one area motivate the study of new basic problems   solution in turn finds
              applications in many other areas.  As the algorithms and techniques become more
              refined and   efficient,  they are implemented to test their pragmatic
              feasibility.
