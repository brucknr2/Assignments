Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This is a proposal to study imprisonment, placement in                    
              asylums, and welfare policies in five common-law countries--the                
              U.S., the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand--                 
              over the period 1955-1985.  During this period the trend has been              
              in all five countries toward an increased use of prisons and a                 
              curtailed use of mental hospitals.  The primary objective of the               
              study is to study more fully the relationship between changes in               
              prison and mental hospital populations in the five countries, and              
              to examine how they relate to changes in welfare policies.                     
                   The study will collect quantitative data on institutional                 
              capacities, welfare benefits, and other variables in each of the               
              five countries.  The analysis would use pooled cross-sectional                 
              timeseries analysis combined with more qualitative historical                  
              analyses.                                                                      
                   This study will contribute greatly to our understanding of                
              how societies identify and sanctions deviants.  Its unique                     
              contribution will be to link social control practices as                       
              exemplified by prisons and mental hospitals with wider social and              
              political processes expressed in the welfare policies of each                  
              nation.
