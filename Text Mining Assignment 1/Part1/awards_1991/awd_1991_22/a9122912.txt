Abstract    :
                   Current phylogenetic hypotheses for orders of insects are                 
              seriously restricted by the lack of clear synapomorphies in the                
              morphological data.  In particular, relationships among members of             
              the Holometabola are highly controversial and few ordinal                      
              relationships are well supported.  Through the use of DNA sequence             
              data taken from various loci in the nuclear and mitochondrial                  
              genome, I propose to produce a new data set for reevaluation of                
              current phylogenetic hypotheses.  The objectives of this research              
              are threefold: (1) to produce a phylogeny for the Holometabola                 
              based on DNA sequence data, (2) to test for the monophyly of the               
              Holometabola, and (3) to compare hierarchical patterns among                   
              different classes of data i.e. morphology, mitochondrial DNA, and              
              single copy nuclear DNA.
