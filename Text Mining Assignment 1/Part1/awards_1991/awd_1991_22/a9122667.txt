Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to investigate a new sampling                 
              technology that could serve as a useful alternative to ceramic cup             
              or hollow fiber technology when sampling for ions. The new method              
              will allow determination of the mobile ion composition of  soil                
              solid and solution phases in a single, insitu , operation, ideal               
              for routine monitoring of contaminant transport through soils, and             
              for evaluating the efficacy of soil-cleanup procedures.
