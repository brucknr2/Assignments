Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The oceanographic instrumentation program supports requests to                 
              acquire instrumentation for the collection, processing and                     
              analysis of oceanographic data.  Support for instrumentation                   
              acquisition requests is predicated on share-use by many NSF-                   
              funded researchers.  This proposal from the Duke University                    
              Marine Laboratory requests funding for equipment that will be                  
              used to support NSF-funded research cruises aboard the R/V CAPE                
              HATTERAS, a 135 foot vessel that is owned by NSF and operated by               
              the University.
