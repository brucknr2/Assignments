Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Game theory and dynamic macroeconomic models typically assume that             
              people are "ultra-rational," both in the sense that they know much             
              about the environment and their competitors' behavior, and in the              
              sense that they know how to use that information in the best                   
              possible way.  This project aims to weaken the assumption that                 
              people are fully rational, and to explore what happens when people             
              behave 'adaptively.'  Recent results from the literature on                    
              artificial intelligence will be used to build a class of adaptive              
              learning schemes that are suitable for studying economic models.               
              These learning schemes will be applied in several economic                     
              contexts.  For example, the "coordination failure problems" will               
              be analyzed, that is, how much coordination can eventually be                  
              expected from a system of agents, each of whom behaves adaptively.             
              Several applications in game theory and macroeconomics will also               
              be studied.  In some settings, the established learning theories               
              will be used as devices to select among alternative equilibria.                
              In other settings, the theories will be used to suggest self-                  
              confirming patterns of behavior that correspond to alternative                 
              notions of equilibria.  Finally, relationships among some existing             
              and new notions of stability, complexity and optimality will also              
              be investigated.
