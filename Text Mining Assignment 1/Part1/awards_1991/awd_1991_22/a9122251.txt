Abstract    :
              High barrier height, low leakage current                                       
              Schottky contacts to III-V semiconductors are                                  
              important for application to field effect                                      
              transistors, optical sensors and photovoltaic                                  
              converters.  Schottky contacts to III-V                                        
              semiconductors will be cryogenically processed                                 
              (CP) to greatly increase barrier height and                                    
              reduce leakage current.  Specific                                              
              semiconductor materials will include n-type                                    
              InP, GaAs, InAlAs and IngaAs.  Diodes will                                     
              be fabricated with the substrate cooled to                                     
              77K, a process which already has given                                         
              promising results in the form of increased                                     
              barrier height, to 0.96 eV in n-InP, and                                       
              reduced leakage current by several orders of                                   
              magnitude.  The metals Al, Cu, Au, Pd and Pt                                   
              will be utilized to show unpinning of the                                      
              Fermi level.  An important aspect of the study                                 
              involves understanding the reason for CP                                       
              contacts to give such improved performance.                                    
              Electrical and optical data will be correlated                                 
              with high resolution structural and chemical                                   
              data.  Electrical and optical data will include                                
              current-voltage-temperature to reveal                                          
              conduction mechanisms, deep level transient                                    
              spectroscopy, photoreflectance spectroscopy,                                   
              photoreflectance spectroscopy, and Raman                                       
              spectroscopy.  High resolution transmission                                    
              electron microscopy and chemical analysis will                                 
              be correlated with other data.  A later focus                                  
              will be made to apply the CP technique to                                      
              quantum well and superlattice structures,                                      
              where extremely sharp interfaces are of great                                  
              importance.
