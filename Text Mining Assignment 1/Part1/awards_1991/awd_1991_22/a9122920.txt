Abstract    :
                   Although herbs typically contribute only a minor fraction of              
              the total biomass or production of a forest, they may be                       
              critically important in regulating forest composition and                      
              dynamics through competition with tree seedlings.  However,                    
              because forests are extremely variable in herb abundance, the                  
              impact of herbs on tree establishment is not consistent.                       
              Resource competition theory leads to the prediction that under                 
              conditions of abundant soil nutrients and moisture but low light,              
              herbaceous plants will win in competition with woody plants,                   
              while higher light or lower soil resource levels should shift the              
              competitive interaction to favor woody plants.  Experimental                   
              manipulations of light and soil resources will be used the                     
              hypothesis that herbs on high-resource sites influence tree                    
              composition by reducing growth rates, and increasing mortality                 
              rates of tree seedlings.  Observation made along herb-cover                    
              gradients will be used to test the general hypothesis that the                 
              light:soil resource supply ratio determines the outcome of                     
              competition between woody and herbaceous plants in understories.               
              If this hypothesis is true, then canopy gaps, herb removal areas,              
              and other low resource microsites could play a critical role by                
              shifting the competitive balance to be more favorable for tree                 
              seedlings.
