Abstract    :
                   This grant covers Experimental Elementary Particle                        
              Physics research by a group at the Pennsylvania State                          
              University in collaboration with other NSF and DOE supported                   
              scientists.  The group will continue at the Brookhaven                         
              National Laboratory (BNL), its measurements of Color                           
              Transparency and Light Cone Structure in QCD Bound States.                     
              Quantum Chromodynamics, a candidate theory describing the                      
              interactions of quarks and leptons, predicts that protons                      
              scattering at large angles from a proton or neutron within a                   
              heavy nucleus should experience reduced final state                            
              interactions, i.e. transparency, with respect to the other                     
              nucleons in the same nucleus.  The group further will develop                  
              plans to study related problems of spin transfer in collisions                 
              at the proposed heavy ion collider at BNL.
