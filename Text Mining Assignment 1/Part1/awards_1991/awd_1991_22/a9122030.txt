Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will work on conformal field                   
              theories associated to the Monster simple group.  These will                   
              provide the first constructions of conformal field theories on an              
              orbifold corresponding to cyclic groups of order greater than                  
              two.  Constructions based on all 23 Niemaier lattices will be                  
              investigated, with the expectation that clues to a covariant                   
              construction of the Moonshine module based on the 26-dimensional               
              Lorentzian lattice will emerge.  The principal investigator will               
              also investigate the genus zero partition functions associated to              
              certain sporadic groups which he has recently discovered.  Some                
              recent ideas involving the interplay between algebraic varieties               
              and group representations will be pursued.                                     
                   This research is concerned with problems in group theory.                 
              In classifying the finite simple groups, a particularly large                  
              group which is called the Monster simple group was discovered.                 
              Subsequently, it has been found that the Monster simple group has              
              interesting connections with the study of Lie algebras and with                
              mathematical physics.  This particular project is aimed at better              
              understanding these relationships.
