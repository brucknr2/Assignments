Abstract    :
              This project is concerned with the modeling of cooperative expert              
              consultation dialogues within a plan-based framework, with                     
              emphasis on the recognition of problem solving and communicative               
              intentions and the handling of negotiation subdialogues.  The                  
              research will develop a rich tripartite dialogue model that                    
              differentiates among domain, problem solving, and communicative                
              intentions yet captures the relationships among them.; beliefs                 
              and intentions will be explicitly ascribed to the participants                 
              and each kind of intention will be recognized incrementally as                 
              the dialogue progresses.
