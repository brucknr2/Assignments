Abstract    :
              The recently discovered protonic photoconductivity (PC) in ice is              
              to be investigated to determine the type of charge carriers, their             
              mobility and the activation energy of their motion.  The analysis              
              will be supported by theoretical calculations of the energy spectra            
              of electrons and of the intrinsic protonic charge carriers (ions               
              and Bjerrum defects).  These studies combined with photo- and                  
              thermo-luminescence will be used to ascertain the electronic                   
              transitions involved and provide a physical mechanism for the PC in            
              ice.
