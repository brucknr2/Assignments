Abstract    :
                   Research in pion and electromagnetic physics will be                      
              undertaken.  In pion physics, principally at LAMPF, the first                  
              unambiguous measurements of the isovector spin-flip strength at                
              low pion energies and the first thorough systematic study of the               
              two- nucleon-emission component of pion absorption, as well as                 
              systematic measurements of the total pion absorption cross                     
              sections will be provided.  Development efforts on the Clamshell               
              spectrometer, the Scruncher, and BGO ball facilities at LAMPF                  
              will be continued.  The use of the LAMPF BGO ball with the Mainz               
              electron accelerator will be pursued to study hadron production                
              from deep inelastic electron scattering.  Development efforts for              
              a detailed study of the pion beta decay process at PSI will                    
              continue, leading to the first measurements with the device.                   
              Work on the design and construction of the focal plane for the                 
              CEBAF photon tagger will continue.  This activity is related to                
              an eta meson photoproduction experiment and a measurement of                   
              photofission cross sections, both using the tagger.
