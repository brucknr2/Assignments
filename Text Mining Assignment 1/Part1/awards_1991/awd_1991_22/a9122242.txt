Abstract    :
                   This award will support a summer internship program in                    
              probability and stochastic processes at the University of                      
              Wisconsin-Madison in order to stimulate and encourage the                      
              scientific development of capable junior researchers.  The                     
              program will provide opportunities for day-to-day interaction                  
              with senior researchers from the University of Wisconsin as well               
              as with senior visitors.  Participants will benefit from access                
              to the major research library and other research facilities at                 
              the University, opportunities to establish continuing contacts                 
              and collaboration with the other participants in the program, and              
              advice and support in developing long term research programs.                  
                   This award will support a summer internship program in                    
              probability and stochastic processes at the University of                      
              Wisconsin-Madison in order to stimulate and encourage the                      
              scientific development of capable junior researchers.
