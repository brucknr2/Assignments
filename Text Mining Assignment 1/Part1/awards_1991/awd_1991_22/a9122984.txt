Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The oceanographic instrumentation program supports requests to                 
              acquire instrumentation for the collection, processing and                     
              analysis of oceanographic data.  This proposal from Texas A&M                  
              University requests funding for equipment that will be used to                 
              support NSF-funded research cruises aboard the R/V GYRE, a 182                 
              foot vessel that is owned by the Navy and operated by the                      
              University.  Equipment requested, which consists of an upgrade                 
              for the SAIL system, new recorders for the autoanalyzer, and                   
              replacement sensors for the CTD, is high priority for the NSF-                 
              funded science programs aboard the R/V GYRE in 1992.
