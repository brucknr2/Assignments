Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              The primary objective of this Dissertation Improvement proposal is             
              to investigate the proportions and size of the upper body in                   
              Neandertals, early modern humans and modern human groups.  The                 
              question of the relationship of Neandertals to early modern humans             
              and of both to modern humans is very much open to discussion.  This            
              research will investigate aspects of those relationships as seen in            
              the body size, robusticity and shape in the skeletal remains from              
              each group.  Using statistics the PIs hope to elucidate                        
              constellations of features in the morphology of the upper body that            
              set each of these groups off from the others.  The study will                  
              contribute to the understanding of the place of Neandertals in                 
              human evolution and the nature of their adaptations.
