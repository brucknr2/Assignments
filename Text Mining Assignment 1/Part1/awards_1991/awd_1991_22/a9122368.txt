Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This is a proposal to study the how participation in political            
              activism and social movements affects people's decisions about                 
              work, education, marriage, and childbearing.  All applicants to the            
              1964 Mississippi Freedom Summer Project will be compared to a                  
              matched comparison group.  The investigators propose to update the             
              life histories of participants in the Freedom Summer Project                   
              previously surveyed in 1988, to obtain comparable life-course data             
              for a sample of individuals who did not participate in the Freedom             
              Summer Project, and to develop and administer a questionnaire                  
              focusing on the subjective dimensions of the relationship between              
              political activism and the life course.  One of the central                    
              questions in the study will be how participation in social                     
              movements such as the Freedom Summer Project have influenced life              
              choices and career trajectories.  An equally important question                
              will be to understand how and why major life events such as                    
              marriage and childbearing often serve to constrain political                   
              activism.                                                                      
                                                                                             
                   This project will contribute to our understanding of the                  
              interrelations between political activism and the life course, and             
              it will also provide insights into the life patterns of a cohort of            
              people who lived through young adulthood during the turbulent                  
              decade of the 1960s.
