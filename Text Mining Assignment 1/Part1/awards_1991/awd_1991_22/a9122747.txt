Abstract    :
              This award provides research support to                                        
              Dr. Michael G. McNally under the Foundation's Presidential                     
              Young Investigator Awards (PYIA) program for the fifth year                    
              base and fourth year matching of $37,500.                                      
                                                                                             
              The research will focus on an investigation of the                             
              performance of transportation systems subject to earthquake                    
              ground motions; and the assessment of impacts of travel                        
              behavior on the physical environment using theoretical and                     
              operational models of complex travel behavior previously                       
              developed by the researcher.
