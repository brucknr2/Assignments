Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A series of experiments will be conducted to investigate the                   
              apparent suppressive effect of incorporated crimson clover                     
              (Trifolium incarnatum L.) residue on the growth of lambsquarters               
              (Chenopodium album L.) in a corn (Zea mays L.) cropping system.                
              Measurements of above and below ground plant parts will document               
              specific effects of a crimson clover nitrogen source on the                    
              growth, development, and nitrogen uptake of sweet corn and                     
              lambsquarters, grown in pure and mixed cultures.  Companion                    
              growth chamber and field studies will examine emergence and time               
              to emergence of both species under a regime of clover-derived                  
              nitrogen.  Is low nitrogen availability responsible for                        
              previously observed suppressive effects on emergence?  A field                 
              study will test for interactive effects of crimson clover residue              
              and ammonium nitrate addition on lambsquarters growth and                      
              nitrogen uptake after emergence.  The results of these studies                 
              will aid in the effective management of legumes in cropping                    
              systems and provide insight on how temporal availability of                    
              resources affects patterns of consumption and growth and,                      
              ultimately, outcomes of competitive interactions between plants.
