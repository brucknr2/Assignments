Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Many of the theoretical models of national economic growth                     
              developed in the last three decades have incorporated                          
              endogenously-generated human capital and knowledge capital, and                
              thus have gone beyond the simple aggregate production function,                
              introduced by Solow in the 1950s, which included only physical                 
              capital, raw labor, and exogenous technical change.  Numerous                  
              empirical cross-country studies of long-run economic growth have               
              been performed in the last few years, but they have accounted for              
              human and knowledge capital accumulation imperfectly if at all.                
              This may have resulted in biased parameter estimates (especially               
              of the elasticity of output with respect to physical capital)                  
              and/or indirect and inefficient hypothesis testing procedures.                 
              This project investigates several important long-run growth                    
              theories using a cross-country data set that includes relatively               
              long (20-30 years minimum) series on education, R&D, intellectual              
              property and related variables for about 70-90 countries.  Use of              
              these data should permit substantially improved statistical                    
              inference concerning the economic growth process.
