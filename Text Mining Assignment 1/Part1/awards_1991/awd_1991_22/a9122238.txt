Abstract    :
              Before his 33rd birthday, Simon Kuznets introduced the logistic                
              and Gompertz curves to economic analysis, defined the key issues               
              in the study of economic growth, and laid the basis for the now                
              standard seasonal adjustments for prices, employment, and output.              
              His next 15 years were devoted to the development of national                  
              income accounts and their application to practical problems of                 
              government.  As chief statistician of the War Production Board,                
              he demonstrated the superiority of the national income approach                
              in establishing wartime and civilian production targets.  During               
              the balance on his career, Kuznets concentrated on developing an               
              empirically based theory of modern economic growth, for which he               
              was awarded the Nobel Prize.  Professor Robert Fogel and Dean                  
              Enid Fogel are investigating the work of Simon S. Kuznets with                 
              the objective not only of assessing his contributions to                       
              economics, but also of showing how Kuznets' work helped to                     
              transform economics during the twentieth century from a branch of              
              moral philosophy to a discipline that provides an important share              
              of the individuals who make and implement economic policy in the               
              government and in business.  They are examining both Kuznets'                  
              substantive contribution to economic knowledge and his scientific              
              methods.  These methods, as much as the substantive work, are a                
              major factor in the transformation of economics, yet they are now              
              known only to a relatively limited circle of empirical                         
              investigators.
