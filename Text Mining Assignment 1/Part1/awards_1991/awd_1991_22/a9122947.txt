Abstract    :
              This award is for support of a two year study to test a preliminary            
              magnetostratigraphic correlation which was developed for Strand                
              Fjord, Axel Heiberg Island, N.W.T., Canada.  In addition to                    
              extending the section to younger (Eocene) and older (Campaign-                 
              Maastrichtian) sediments, an in-depth lithostratigraphic and                   
              magnetostratigraphic study will be made of a laminated lagoonal                
              sequence at Strand Fjord.  This sequence affords a nearly unique               
              opportunity to obtain a Late Cretaceous polar paleoclimate record              
              of annual variability that also extends into the Milankovitch                  
              frequency band.
