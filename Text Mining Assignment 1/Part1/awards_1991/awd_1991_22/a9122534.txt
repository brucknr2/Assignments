Abstract    :
                   This grant covers experimental Elementary Particle                        
              Physics research by Dr. Sheaff at the University of Wisconsin                  
              Madison in collaboration with other NSF and DOE supported                      
              scientists.  She plans to study the Hadroproduction of Heavy                   
              Flavors at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory.  Her                     
              studies involve the production and subsequent decay of                         
              particles containing a charmed quark.  The detailed study of                   
              such states of matter is important in delineating the details                  
              of the Standard Model of Quarks and Leptons that describes the                 
              particles and interactions observed in nature.  Dr. Sheaff                     
              further plans detector development research which could                        
              significantly increase the opportunity to study the properties                 
              of bottom quark states.
