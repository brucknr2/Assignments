Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program                 
              will help the Department of Chemistry at Haverford College, an                 
              undergraduate institution, acquire a 300 MHz NMR spectrometer                  
              which will be used in research investigations in the following                 
              areas of chemistry:                                                            
                                                                                             
              1.  the synthesis of complex organic molecules                                 
                                                                                             
              2.  the structural environment of metals in proteins                           
                                                                                             
              3.  solar energy conversion assemblies that mimic plant                        
                  photosynthesis                                                             
                                                                                             
              Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy is the most                      
              powerful tool available to the chemist for the elucidation of                  
              the structure of molecules.  It is used to identify unknown                    
              substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within                 
              molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between                   
              molecules in solution.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR                         
              spectroscopy is essential to chemists who are carrying out                     
              frontier research.  The results from these NMR studies are                     
              useful in areas such as polymers and catalysis, and in biology.
