Abstract    :
              The standard story of the emergence of the modern industrial world             
              is that in Britain between 1770 and 1850 there were two                        
              revolutions: the first and better known, the Industrial Revolution;            
              and the second, the Agricultural Revolution.  There remains,                   
              however, an unresolved dispute about the nature of the Agricultural            
              Revolution and its relationship to the Industrial Revolution.                  
              Agriculture from 1700 to 1850 experienced important organizational             
              changes with the elimination of almost all common field villages               
              and the decline of self-contained peasant farms in favor of large              
              "capitalist" farms which employed most of the rural populations as             
              wage laborers.  Two interpretations -mainstream and Marxist- share             
              the perspective that the reorganization of agriculture from small,             
              peasant open field farms to large-scale, enclosed, capitalist farms            
              was the major source of productivity advance in Britain, and the               
              reason why British agricultural productivity far exceeded the rest             
              of Europe.  Where the views differ is over the mechanism by which              
              this reorganization increased productivity and the effects it had              
              on the peasantry.  This research will help to settle this long                 
              lasting dispute, and it will also provide useful insights into the             
              process of economic growth and development.                                    
                                                                                             
              Specifically, the purpose of this project is to collect and analyze            
              a large new set of data for English agriculture for the period 1600            
              to 1850 which will contain observations on the market rental value             
              of agricultural land, the rate of return on capital, and rural                 
              wages.  At least 21,000 observations on market land rents will be              
              collected for the period 1600 to 1837.  With this date set it will             
              be possible to shed light on several important questions about the             
              Agricultural Revolution in England such as:  When did occur?  How              
              important was it to the Industrial Revolution?  How important were             
              property rights changes during that period?  What was the mechanism            
              by which yields and labor productivity increased?  How important               
              was the expulsion of surplus labor from agriculture in creating the            
              Industrial Revolution?
