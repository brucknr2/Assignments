Abstract    :
              In this project funded by Experimental Physical Chemistry in                   
              the Chemistry Division, Prof. Berberian (St. Joseph's College)                 
              will study rotational motion of dielectrically active molecules                
              in solution with non-polar, structurally similar species. The                  
              temperature, frequency, and concentration dependence of                        
              dielectric constant will be used to distinguish among competing                
              models for liquid state dynamic behavior. By extending the                     
              measurements to low temperatures, intermolecular forces                        
              characteristic of the glassy state will be elucidated. The work                
              is to be carried out with the aid of undergraduate assistants,                 
              who will benefit by exposure to modern research equipment and                  
              methodology.                                                                   
              %%%                                                                            
              Some molecules possess tiny electric dipole moments. By                        
              disolving such molecules in mixtures of electrically inert                     
              species of similar size and shape, and making the solution part                
              of an electric circuit, it is possible to use variations in                    
              current to study how the surroundings of a molecule influence                  
              its rotational motion. This is important because at low                        
              temperatures where the motion becomes extremely sluggish,                      
              detailed understanding of the intermolecular forces is absent.                 
              Prof. Beberian's project in this area will lead to an improved                 
              undertanding of this "glassy" state of matter.
