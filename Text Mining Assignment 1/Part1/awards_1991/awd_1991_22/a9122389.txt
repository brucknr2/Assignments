Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The political transformation of the Soviet Union from an                       
              authoritarian to an increasingly participatory society                         
              provides a unique opportunity to examine the emergence of new                  
              modes of political activity during a period of state                           
              formation.  This study links data on political participation                   
              and other forms of organizational behavior from two already                    
              completed first stage surveys of approximately 7,000                           
              respondents in Estonia and 12,000 in Russia (RSFSR) with a                     
              second wave of more detailed interviews of approximately                       
              1,500 in Estonia and 3,500 in the RSFSR.  The interviews will                  
              explore the extent of political and organizational                             
              involvement.  Explanations for this involvement will be                        
              sought in the reasons people give for their activity, in the                   
              resources of time, money, and skills they have available, and                  
              in the networks of friends and acquaintances that get them                     
              involved in organizations.  Because the first interviews were                  
              before the August, 1991 coup attempt and the second wave will                  
              be in early 1992, the investigators will gather important                      
              data on how people's activities and attitudes changed during                   
              this historic period.  The end result should be a                              
              significantly better understanding of how political                            
              participation and democracy is developing in Estonia and in                    
              the RSFSR.
