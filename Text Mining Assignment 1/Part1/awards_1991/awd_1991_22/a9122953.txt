Abstract    :
              Cladistic analysis of the click beetle tribe Agrypnini is proposed             
              as the basis for analysis of phylogentic and biogeographic                     
              patterns.  The proposed research has the following goals:                      
              (1) performing a detailed comparative study of the external,                   
              genitalic, and internal reproductive morphology of representatives             
              of all agrypnine genera; (2) performing cladistic analysis to                  
              establish a hypothesis of phylogenetic relationships of agrypnine              
              genera; and (3) using the phylogenetic hypothesis of agrypnine                 
              generic relationships as the basis for: (a) taxonomic                          
              classification of the tribe; and (b) analysis of area relationships            
              in this tribe.  The Agrypnini is distributed worldwide, with                   
              several large widespread genera and a number of smaller genera                 
              endemic to one region.  The biogeographical analysis will compare              
              results from biogeographical parsimony analysis, component                     
              analysis, and quantification of component analysis.  Funds are                 
              requested for travel to major European entomological museum for                
              examination of material for morphological studies and cladistic                
              analysis, and for scanning electron microscopy (SEM).  SEM will be             
              used to examine, interpret, and illustrate micromorphological                  
              characters, especially the mouthparts and ultrastructure of setal              
              scales.  The proposed research will provide additional character               
              systems for comparison with other elaterid taxa, will provide                  
              biogeographical patterns for comparison with unrelated taxa, and               
              will compare efficacy of biogeographical analysis methodologies.
