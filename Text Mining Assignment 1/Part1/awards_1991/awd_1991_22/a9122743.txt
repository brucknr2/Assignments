Abstract    :
              Protecting groups are a vital tool in the synthesis of                         
              multifunctional molecules such as valuable third                               
              generation pharmaceuticals.  When a reaction must be                           
              carried out at a specific reaction site, protecting groups                     
              are often used to temporarily block other sensitive                            
              reaction sites on the molecule.  Substituted benzyl                            
              alcohols are particularly useful as protecting groups.                         
              They are prepared by reacting electrophiles with a simple                      
              derivative of benzyl alcohol, benzyl alcohol ester.                            
              Although this reaction proceeds in excellent yield, it                         
              results in a mixture of isomers with similar physical                          
              properties.  Separation of the isomers is                                      
              expensive and technically difficult.                                           
                                                                                             
              This project is focused on the continued investigation of                      
              a novel membrane-based process to address the above                            
              problem.  The process couples a selective catalyzed                            
              reaction with membrane-based separation.  Each reaction                        
              product is a commercially important protecting group in                        
              pharmaceutical                                                                 
              synthesis.
