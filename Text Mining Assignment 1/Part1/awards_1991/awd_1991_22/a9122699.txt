Abstract    :
              This project, supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry                
              Program, examines ion-molecule chemistry in the quadrupole ion                 
              trap.  The goal of the research is to develop an understanding                 
              of ion-molecule chemistry as it applies to the mass                            
              spectrometric analysis of large organic molecules, eventually                  
              carbohydrate-containing antibiotics.  Initial work will                        
              concentrate on the laser desorption of relevant molecules into                 
              the quadrupole ion trap.  Substituent effects on the subsequent                
              bimolecular ion-molecule reactions in the ion trap will be                     
              explored, with a view to exploiting these reactions for                        
              structural identification of large, complex organic molecules.

              Carbohydrates are extremely important molecules in biological                  
              systems, but the determination of their structures is very                     
              difficult, especially because they usually cannot be                           
              crystallized for X-ray structural studies.  Determination of                   
              structures by mass spectrometry is also difficult, since many                  
              interesting carbohydrates are very difficult to vaporize, and                  
              mass spectrometry is a gas phase technique. In this research                   
              project laser desorption methods will be used to place                         
              carbohydrates and other large organic molecules in the gas                     
              phase, and controlled ion-molecule reaction chemistry will be                  
              used to cut the large molecules into fragments by mass                         
              spectrometry, as required for structural analysis.
