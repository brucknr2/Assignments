Abstract    :
                   Regression is a widely used statistical technique in the                  
              social sciences, but most regression analyses applied to                       
              spatially referenced data that take account of latent spatial                  
              autocorrelation assume normally distributed error terms and                    
              involve maximum likelihood estimation.  In traditional                         
              statistical analysis this situation results in a nonlinear                     
              structure, leading to estimation procedures that require slow                  
              iterative solutions.  This makes spatial regression                            
              computationally intensive, thus slowing the dissemination of                   
              spatial statistics and spatial econometrics techniques.  This                  
              project will explore useful approximations to this normalizing                 
              factor in spatial regression to simplify the analysis of                       
              intermediate and large size data sets and to demonstrate the                   
              utility of these simplifications.  The approach will involve                   
              simulation experiments with timing functions to evaluate the                   
              costs and benefits of reductions in numerical intensity.                       
              Experiments will be conducted in a supercomputer environment.                  
                   This project will assist in the removal of barriers to the                
              dissemination of spatial statistical procedures, and it should                 
              reduce the numerical intensity normally associated with the use                
              of spatial statistics in social science research.
