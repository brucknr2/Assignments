Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This grant examined high temperature rheology of continuous                    
              fiber-reinforced ceramic matrix composites (CMC) materials.  It                
              uses an analytical model to predict the creep response of a bulk               
              composite specimen.  The model is then compared with the                       
              experimental results from the creep experiments.  The research                 
              emphasizes (1) investigation of different constitutive models for              
              the interface/interphase, (2) post-deformation microstructural and             
              microchemical analyses of deformed composite specimens, (3)                    
              characterization of time-dependent responses, and (4) extension of             
              the approaches to other composite systems.  Initial system is a                
              SiC (NICALON) fiber and calcium aluminosilicate glass-ceramic                  
              (Corning-CAS-III) matrix composite.

              This study combines experimental and analytical approaches to study            
              high temperature rheology of continuous ceramic matrix composites.             
              Both approaches are used for comparison and serve to correct and               
              support each other.  This kind of study can have possible                      
              applicability beyond the material system under investigation.  It              
              can provide a solid scientific basis to understand high temperature            
              rheological properties of CMC.  Improvements in the performance of             
              CMC can be expected from this study.
