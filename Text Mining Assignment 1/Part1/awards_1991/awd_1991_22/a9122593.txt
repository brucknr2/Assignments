Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                                         ABSTRACT                                            
                                                                                            
              The Workshop on Cross-Language Speech Perception will bring                    
              together 22 investigators currently pursuing programmatic                      
              research in 4 areas: 1) development of language-specific patterns              
              of perception during first language acquisition, 2) perception by              
              multilingual children and adults, 3) perceptual changes during                 
              foreign language learning, 4) modification of perception in the                
              laboratory (perceptual training studies).  The 4-day workshop                  
              will provide an opportunity for intensive disucssions of                       
              theoretical issues and methodological problems among senior                    
              investigators and less experienced researchers.  Presentations                 
              will include: 1) individual oral reports, 2) panel discussions on              
              broad topics of concern, and 3) poster sessions in which graduate              
              students, postdoctoral students and established researchers can                
              present new experimental results.  The audience will be                        
              interested faculty and students, including students of the                     
              invited participants.  During the workshop, participants will                  
              complete plans for publication of a monograph which will include               
              jointly-authoried papers on recent data on cross-language speech               
              perception, current theoretical perspectives, methodological                   
              issues, and directions for future research.  The objectives of                 
              the workshop are to: 1) provide a forum for in-depth exchange of               
              "cutting edge" information on cross-language speech research, 2)               
              facilitate collaboration in future research, and 3) provide a set              
              of "position papers" which summarize the status of knowledge of                
              this research area.
