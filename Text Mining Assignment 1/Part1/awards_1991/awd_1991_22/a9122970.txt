Abstract    :
              Ethology, the biological study of behavior, emerged as a major                 
              new scientific discipline in the first two decades after World                 
              War II, building upon conceptual and methodological foundations                
              established by Konrad Lorenz and Niko Tinbergen in the 1930s.  In              
              the post-war period, increasing numbers of researchers were drawn              
              to the study of behavior, the primary institutional structures of              
              the discipline of ethology were created, biennial international                
              congresses served to define and guide the ethological community,               
              and ethology's early conceptual foundations underwent elaboration              
              and alteration.  Dr. Burkhardt's goal is to describe and analyze               
              ethology's development from 1945 to 1965.  Taking a comparative                
              and "ecological" approach, he is exploring how the guiding                     
              issues, concepts, and practices of ethology evolved as the                     
              original founders of the discipline and a new generation of                    
              investigators established research centers in Germany, Holland,                
              Great Britain, and the United States and responded to the                      
              challenges and opportunities provided by contact with                          
              investigators from other disciplines.  This study builds on Dr.                
              Burkhardt's earlier research on animal behavior studies before                 
              World War II.  This research is aimed at presenting the first                  
              systematic treatment of the history of ethology in this century.
