Abstract    :
                   Research principally in electromagnetic nuclear physics                   
              is planned.  Most of the experimental effort will be directed                  
              towards CEBAF.  A photon tagger will be developed for use in                   
              approved CEBAF experiments relating to structure of the                        
              nucleon anomalous magnetic moment, shadowing phenomena in                      
              total photo-absorption, and vector meson decay of nucleon                      
              resonances.  Research on low energy nuclear structure using                    
              magnetic electron scattering will be carried out at the                        
              Darmstadt microtron in Germany.  Work will continue on                         
              development of a new neutral meson spectrometer for use in                     
              pion charge exchange and other pion reactions at LAMPF and                     
              elsewhere.
