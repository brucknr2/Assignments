Abstract    :
              This proposal contributes to ISTCS'92-the Israel Symposium on the              
              Theory of Computing and Systems to be held in Haifa, Israel, May 27 to         
              28, 1992.  Interaction between Israeli and American computer                   
              scientists has always been very fruitful.  At the same time, it has            
              always been quite imbalanced-quite a few Israeli researchers travel to         
              the US, but only a small number of American researchers visit Israel.          
              As a result, many of the Israeli universities faculty members,                 
              students, and researchers in industrial research organizations have            
              only limited opportunities to interact with their American colleagues,         
              leaving room for improvement.  A major inhibitor for closer                    
              interaction  is the travel expenses.  It is the objective of this              
              proposal to  provide partial support for American researchers who are          
              interested in attending.
