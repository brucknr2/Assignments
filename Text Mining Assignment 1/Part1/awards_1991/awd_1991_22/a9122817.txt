Abstract    :
              The purpose of the proposed research is to identify the number and             
              locations of genetic factors underlying differences in adult male              
              genital morphology in the Drosophila melanogaster species subgroup.            
              The approach will involve labeling individual genomic segments of              
              the mauritiana genome with a P-element construct containing an eye-            
              color marker.  The study will also be aided by the use of molecular            
              markers.  We propose a program of hybridization with simulans                  
              followed by repeated backcrossing to create a large number of                  
              simulans strains each true-breeding for a separate introgressed                
              segment to the mauritiana genome.  These strains will be analyzed              
              for characters of the male genitalia which differ of these                     
              characters.  Knowledge of the number of genetic factors that                   
              underlie genitalic differentiation between closely related species             
              is crucial to our understanding of this widespread phenomenon,                 
              especially in the construction of evolutionary models to account               
              for it.  Additional aspects of the study will address whether the              
              effects of the introgressed loci show additivity or dominance, and             
              the degree to which these loci interact epistatically to produce               
              this divergent morphology.
