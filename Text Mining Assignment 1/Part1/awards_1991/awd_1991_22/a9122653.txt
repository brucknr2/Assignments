Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project plans to conduct fundamental research on the                      
              molecular design of novel and highly sensitive                                 
              inorganic/organometallic photoinitiators, elucidation of the                   
              mechanism of initiation, and evaluation of new                                 
              radiation-sensitive materials for photolithographic applications               
              in microelelectronics.   The scope of  research includes new                   
              classes of photoresponsive materials possessing improved thermal               
              stability, photosensitivity, and wavelength response.

              Knowledge gained from these studies will aid in the design of                  
              new generation photosensitive materials required to satisfy the                
              increasingly demanding needs of the microelectronics, coatings,                
              and reprographic industries.
