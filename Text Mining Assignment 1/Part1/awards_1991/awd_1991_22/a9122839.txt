Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The oceanographic instrumentation program supports requests to                 
              acquire instrumentation for the collection, processing and analysis            
              of oceanographic data.  This proposal from University of Rhode                 
              Island requests funding for equipment that will be used to support             
              NSF-funded research cruises aboard the R/V ENDEAVOR, a 177 foot                
              vessel that is owned by NSF and operated by the University.
