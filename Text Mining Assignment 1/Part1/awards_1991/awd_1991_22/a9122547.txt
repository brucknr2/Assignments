Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator plans to model and analyze flows               
              driven by substantial energy inputs such as chemical reactions,                
              having in mind premixed combustion and vapor explosions.                       
              Detonation can be achieved experimentally in various ways.  One                
              goal of this project is to classify the possible routes to                     
              detonation by considering the affect of high-frequency                         
              disturbances and pulses, realistic chemistry, and                              
              inhomogeneities.                                                               
                   The necessity of limiting combustion-caused environmental                 
              pollution and the transportation of combustible materials, for                 
              example, require an improved understanding of the process of                   
              combustion.
