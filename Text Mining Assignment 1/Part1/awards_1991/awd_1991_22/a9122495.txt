Abstract    :
              The Solar-Terrestrial Energy Program (STEP) is an international                
              program to advance the understanding of the transfer of energy                 
              and mass through the solar-terrestrial environment.  STEP                      
              involves ground-based, aircraft, balloon, rocket and satellite                 
              experiments; theory and simulation studies; and dedicated data                 
              and information systems.  The program will take advantage of                   
              results obtained by spacecraft missions and related programs such              
              as NSF's GEM, CEDAR, and MAX91, research and monitoring                        
              activities of NOAA/SEL,  and various research activites supported              
              by the Office of Naval Research (ONR) and other key sponsors of                
              solar-terrestrial research.  The framework of STEP consists of                 
              Priority Areas, each one with a goal of understanding the                      
              processes controlling energy and mass transfer between specific                
              regions of the solar-terrestrial system.  The scientific                       
              research in STEP is organized into a limited number of well-                   
              defined cooperative projects proposed by the scientific                        
              communities of the participating countries.  To define, plan and               
              implement the research coordination, Working Groups for each                   
              Priority Area have been established.  STEP is the key                          
              international coordination effort, fully inclusive of various                  
              research modes, active during the first half of the 1990's.  This              
              grant provides partial support of the STEP Symposium on initial                
              results from STEP facilities and theory campaigns to be held                   
              August 24-27, 1992, at Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics                
              Laboratory.  Additional support for this symposium is anticipated              
              from NASA, NSF, NOAA, and ONR.
