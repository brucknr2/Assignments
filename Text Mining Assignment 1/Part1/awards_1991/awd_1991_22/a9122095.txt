Abstract    :
                   The goal of research on programming environments is to increase           
              the productivity of the software-development process by providing              
              better tools for creating, manipulating, and understanding programs.           
              During the week of March 9-13,1992, a workshop on programming                  
              environments will be held at the recently established International            
              Conference and Research Center for Computer Science (IBFI) at Dagstuhl         
              Castle in Wadern, Germany.  The workshop will bring together about             
              forty active researchers in the area.  It will focus on new and recent         
              developments, with emphasis on the following topics:                           
                                                                                             
                        o  Single-programmer language-based environments                     
                                                                                             
                        o  Generation of programming environments                            
                                                                                             
                        o  Tool-integration mechanisms                                       
                                                                                             
                        o  Debugging                                                         
                                                                                             
                        o  Merging and restructuring of systems                              
                                                                                             
                        o  Projection and understanding of systems                           
                                                                                             
                        o  Incremental computation                                           
                                                                                             
                   The intention of the workshop is to stimulate intellectual                
              ferment among the participants.  The workshop's format will make it            
              possible for participants to give more in-depth presentations than is          
              customary at conferences.  Presentations that include demonstrations           
              of working systems or prototypes will be encouraged.  This award               
              provides funds to cover the transatlantic airfare of the participants          
              from the United States.
