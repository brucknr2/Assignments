Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award funds a study of the linear polarization of the                     
              centimeter wavelength radiation from Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN)              
              on the smallest scales.  This is to be accomplished with the                   
              technique of polarization sensitive Very Long Baseline                         
              Interferometry (VLBI), whereby the linear polarization structure               
              of compact radio sources may be determined on angular scales of                
              milliarcseconds at multiple wavelengths.  Dr. Roberts is one of                
              the pioneers and leading investigators in VLBI polarization                    
              studies.  At the distances of AGN, these small angular scales                  
              correspond to physical scales of light years.  The linear                      
              polarization tells us about the magnetic field structure,                      
              radiation mechanisms, particle content, kinematics, and geometry               
              of the radio jets produced by AGN, which will help us understand               
              their structure and evolution.  The ultimate goal of this work is              
              to understand the mechanism which lies at the heart of AGN,                    
              currently thought to be accretion onto massive black holes.
