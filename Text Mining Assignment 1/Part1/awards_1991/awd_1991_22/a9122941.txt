Abstract    :
              This project is an effort to determine continental-scale and                   
              regional-scale sources of pollution aerosol collected at the GISP-2            
              and Dye-3 sites in Greenland.  It will make use of a                           
              chemically-based source apportionment technique known as receptor              
              modelling, which chemical signatures developed for regional-scale              
              sources in North America and Eurasia are applied to the analyses of            
              snow and ice samples.                                                          
                                                                                             
              Geographically specific industrialized regions display                         
              characteristic patterns of trace element composition of their                  
              aerosol emissions, which include contributions from power plants,              
              smelters, motor vehicles, biomass burning, etc.  Some rely on                  
              anomalously high concentrations of exotic trace elements such as               
              arsenic, indium, selenium, and vanadium, which are found in                    
              extremely low concentrations in Greenland.                                     
                                                                                             
              The project will make use of samples collected at the GISP-2 site              
              during the past two seasons, and will collect additional samples in            
              the summer of 1992.
