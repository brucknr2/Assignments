Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research would study the implications of learning-by-doing in             
              production for theoretical models of industrial organization.  The             
              most common technological specification of learning-by-doing is the            
              learning curve hypothesis that a firm's unit cost declines with                
              cumulative output.  A first research task is to study the strategic            
              implications of the learning curve in a dynamic model of duopoly.              
              The methodology is to characterize a symmetric Markov perfect                  
              equilibrium and evaluate its properties.  A second task is to                  
              derive implications for antitrust, trade, and patent policies.  A              
              third task is to reconsider the foundations of the learning curve              
              hypothesis, studying industrial organization implications of other,            
              more general, learning-by-doing technologies.  A final task is to              
              extend these models to investigate the equilibrium timing of                   
              production and deliveries when buyers as well as firms behave                  
              strategically.  This research departs from previous industrial                 
              organization research in several respects: (1) the theoretical                 
              model is new; (2) the analytical methods are different; and (3) new            
              questions are raised.  A longer term goal is to lay foundations for            
              empirical work.
