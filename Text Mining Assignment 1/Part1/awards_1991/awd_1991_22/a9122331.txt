Abstract    :
              With support from the Organic Dynamics and the Solid State                     
              Chemistry Programs Dr. George Whitesides will continue his                     
              studies of self-assembling organic structures.  The system                     
              chosen for study is the 1:1 complex between cyanuric acid and                  
              melamine.  Procedures for designing, synthesizing and                          
              characterizing these self-assembling hydrogen-bond connected                   
              structures will be developed.  Similar networks of hydrogen                    
              bonds will also be used in order to simplify the structures of                 
              organic crystals.  The results from these studies will be                      
              utilized in order to define rules of self-assembly.

              The formation of new materials will be investigated.  These new                
              materials consist of aggregrates of molecules held together by                 
              networks of bridging hydrogens.  The long term goals of this                   
              research include: (1) to understand the factors which control                  
              the formation of these aggregates, and (2) to understand the                   
              relationship between the structure of the component molecules                  
              and the structure of the crystal aggregrate.
