Abstract    :
              An investigation of stereochemical control of free radical                     
              addition processes will be conducted. The overall goal of the                  
              research is to define the mechanism of free radical addition                   
              processes which results in exact control of the stereochemistry                
              of the final products generated. Reactions to be investigated                  
              during the course of this project include radical additions,                   
              atom transfer, and polymerizations of alkenes bearing amide                    
              auxiliaries. Precise regulation of the tacticity of                            
              specifically engineered oligomers and polymers will be                         
              accomplished by use of very specific stereochemical reactions.                 
              The exact distribution of oligomers will be regulated by                       
              reactions in micellar environments designed to produce a                       
              discrete number of reaction steps. In addition, the chemistry                  
              of peroxyl radical rearrangement and cyclization reactions will                
              be investigated by the use of stereochemical probes and oxygen                 
              isotopes.                                                                      
              %%%                                                                            
              This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the                      
              continuing work of Professor N. A. Porter at Duke University.                  
              The studies will center around efforts to engineer the exact                   
              structure of molecules by extremely efficient and selective                    
              free radical reactions. By forcing chemical reactions to take                  
              place in very specific pathways, it is possible to generate                    
              molecules that are designed to solve important problems by                     
              virtue of their carefully controlled structure. One of the                     
              final goals of this work is to make molecules which have many                  
              repeat units of exactly the same orientation in space. This                    
              will result in molecules with very unusual properties.
