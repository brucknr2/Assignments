Abstract    :
              This project aims to understand the cognitive models, assumptions,             
              and inference methods the comprise the layperson's system of                   
              "intuitive toxicology" and to compare this system with the                     
              cognitive models, assumptions, and inference methods of                        
              toxicologists and risk assessors.  Such comparisons would expose               
              the similarities and differences within the expert and lay                     
              communities as well as the differences between lay perceptions and             
              expert views.  Several empirical studies will be designed,                     
              conducted, and reported during the course of this project.  These              
              studies should produce clearer, better articulated representation              
              of the conceptual frameworks that exist for experts and laypeople              
              with regard to chemical hazards and the scientific methods used to             
              assess chemical risks.  Such representations are crucial for                   
              improved methods of risk assessment and for the development of a               
              risk-management process that replaces polarized social conflict                
              with effective multi-way communication about chemical risks and                
              benefits.
