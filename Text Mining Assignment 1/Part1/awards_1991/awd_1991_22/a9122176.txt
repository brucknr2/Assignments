Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research examines equilibrium selection in infinitely repeated            
              games played by boundedly rational agents.  The decision rules used            
              by these players will be determined by an evolutionary process in              
              which successful rules proliferate while unsuccessful rules die.               
                                                                                             
              The project first develops a model of boundedly rational players,              
              building on recent work using finite automata.  A dynamic                      
              evolutionary process will then be constructed, with particular                 
              attention devoted to the fact that with conventional definitions,              
              evolutionarily stable strategies do not exist in repeated games.               
              The research will then examine the limiting outcomes of this                   
              evolutionary process, which will embody both rules for action and              
              rules for learning from experience during the game.  Finally, the              
              robustness of the results, especially to different specifications              
              of environmental "trembles," will be explored.                                 
                                                                                             
              The effectiveness of game theory is limited by the "folk theorem,"             
              which established that in repeated games, virtually anything can               
              be an equilibrium.  The significance of the proposed research lies             
              in its potential to yield game-theoretic predictions for repeated              
              games, making game theory a more powerful analytical tool for a                
              wide class of applications.  In particular, the research should                
              shed light on the evolution of learning rules among boundedly                  
              rational agents.
