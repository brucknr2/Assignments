Abstract    :
              Permafrost temperatures are an extremely sensitive indicator of                
              climatic change.  Changes too small to be detected by continuous               
              measurements of the surface energy budget occur as clear and robust            
              changes in permafrost temperature profiles.  This award supports               
              research to allow rational utilization of permafrost temperature               
              data and to improve current interpretations of permafrost                      
              temperature profiles.  These tasks require a better understanding              
              of the influence of the active layer and snow cover on the thermal             
              regime of permafrost.  The research program consists of field and              
              laboratory measurements, interpretation, and modeling the thermal              
              response of permafrost to changes in climate.  This research will              
              be conducted at four established sites along the Haul Road between             
              the Brooks Range and Prudhoe Bay.  Measurements will include daily             
              temperatures at eleven levels from the air 1/2m or more into the               
              permafrost, annual permafrost temperatures to depths of 80m, in                
              situ and laboratory measurements of thermal and other properties of            
              the numerical model for predicting temperatures at all levels.                 
              This continuing research effort is necessary to develop an                     
              understanding of climatic change that has occurred and may be                  
              occurring in the permafrost areas of Alaska and the north polar                
              region.
