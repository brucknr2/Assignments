Abstract    :
                   The investigator intends to continue work on generic objects              
              constructed from 0 and other problems in forcing.  In                          
              particular, he will attempt to extend S. D. Friedman's work,                   
              obtaining a non-constructible ZF-Pi-1-2-singleton constructible                
              from 0.  Several related problems in set theory will also be                   
              considered.                                                                    
                   Set theory provides the popular way to lay the foundations                
              for all of mathematics, the best known systematic attempt to do                
              this being Russell and Whitehead's Principia Mathematica.                      
              Important foundational questions concern the independence and the              
              consistency of the axioms used to establish set theory.  Zermelo               
              and Fraenkel's axioms (ZF for short) are one of the most                       
              convenient sets of basic axioms.  However, it has been known                   
              since the work of Kurt Goedel in the 1930's that no axioms for                 
              set theory can be complete as well as consistent.  This means                  
              that no set of axioms can be powerful enough to prove every                    
              possible proposition or else its negation, but not both.  Upon                 
              this startling theorem has been erected a rich theory, treating                
              possible propositions P such that either P or Not P can be added               
              to ZF without resulting in a contradiction.  Any such proposition              
              P is said to be independent of ZF and can be taken as an                       
              additional axiom of set theory.  The principal technique for                   
              finding such independent propositions is Paul J. Cohen's so-                   
              called method of forcing and its offspring.  This is the circle                
              of ideas involved in and motivating the investigator's research.
