Abstract    :
              Theory of Membranes and Complex Fluids - The proposed research is              
              aimed at a variety of topics related to memebranes and complex                 
              fluids.  Membranes are two-dimensional structures formed from any              
              of a number of molecular entities.  They form the walls of living              
              cells, and are important components of complex fluids such as                  
              microemulsions.  Membranes can exist in a number of forms,                     
              including fluid, orientationally rigid, crystalline, and                       
              polymerized phases, and can form topologically complex structures.             
              This project focusses on equilibrium and dynamical aspects of order            
              within the membrane structure itself, and how these are influenced             
              by the large-scale effects of membrane shape and interactions with             
              other membranes.                                                               
              %%%                                                                            
              Though the world we live in is three dimensional, there are many               
              examples in nature of two-dimensional systems, including                       
              structureless interfaces between two coexisting materials (e.g.,               
              air and water), thin films, and membranes.  The structure of a thin            
              film is determined by an external constraint (e.g., the perimeter              
              of a soap film).  A membrane, however, can attain a                            
              thermodynamically stable structure of its own, which can undergo               
              large changes of shape without losing its integrity.  Such                     
              membranes are important for the study of biomaterials, and also                
              appear in a wide variety of chemical synthesis processes,                      
              including production of numerous catalytic materials.
