Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Institutional investors now hold over half of US equities,                
              and most of this money is managed by professional money managers.              
              Although progressively more of that money is put into index funds              
              -- a strategy suggested by standard finance models -- the                      
              majority is still managed actively.  That is, money managers                   
              allocate money between stocks and bonds, and choose individual                 
              securities within both groups.  Despite the important role played              
              by professional money managers in financial markets, there has                 
              been relatively little research on money management so far,                    
              particularly on institutional money management.  This project                  
              studies the behavior of institutional investors and the impact of              
              their trading on stock prices using three data sets.  The first                
              data set covers 769 pension funds and gives their quarterly                    
              portfolio holdings over 1985-1989.  The second data set covers 37              
              very large money management firms and gives their daily trades                 
              during 1986-1988.  The third data set covers 143 open end mutual               
              funds and gives their annual performance during 1965-1984.                     
                                                                                             
                   The project addresses empirically the following broad                     
              questions:                                                                     
              1.  How prevalent are particular types of investment strategies                
              among institutional money mangers?  Are managers consistent over               
              time in following a particular strategy?                                       
              2.  What is the nature of the agency relationship between fund                 
              sponsors and managers, and how does it affect the trading                      
              strategies of the funds?  In particular what is the role of the                
              trading horizon, of the compensation arrangements, and of                      
              relative performance evaluation?                                               
              3.  How does excess demand by institutions affect stock prices?                
              Do institutions herd?  Based on the strategies they follow and                 
              their herding tendencies, are institutions likely to have a                    
              destabilizing influence on stock prices in the sense of moving                 
              them away from fundamental values?
