Abstract    :
              Education is central to a large number of issues that economists               
              consider important: the distribution of income, the growth rate of             
              an economy, and the determination of a country's comparative                   
              advantage are a few prominent examples.  Despite this, the factors             
              that determine the nature of the educational system have received              
              relatively little theoretical attention.  The purpose of this                  
              project is to develop models to study the endogenous determination             
              of educational policy.  It will do so by studying various                      
              interactions among income distribution, the political system, and              
              key attributes of the educational system.  Quality, accessibility              
              and community composition are the characteristics this project                 
              plans to concentrate on, with special attention paid to the                    
              consequences that arise from the fact that education is provided               
              by both the private and the public sector.
