Abstract    :
                   This research project produces new methods for high                       
              dimensional multivariate calibration curves.  It will address                  
              methods that are robust with respect to interaction effects.  In               
              addition, it will advance calibration methods with errors in the               
              calibration standards.  Methods from chemistry and environmental               
              chemistry will be the focus.                                                   
                   Important policy and legal decisions often depend upon                    
              accurate measurements.  These in turn depend upon good                         
              calibration of the instruments.  For example, the knowledge of                 
              the extent or rate of the ozone depletion depends upon ground-                 
              based Dobson measurements which are suspect due to poor                        
              calibration.  The problem of improving calibration methods is one              
              of several to be considered in this research.
