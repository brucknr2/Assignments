Abstract    :
              The Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program of the                     
              Chemistry Division has provided support to Professor Zhang to                  
              use a novel computational method to conduct two studies in the                 
              general area of chemical dynamics:  (1) a study of dissociative                
              adsorption and associative desorption of hydrogen on transition                
              metals, and (2) an investigation of the rotational state                       
              distribution in the vibrational predissociation of the HF                      
              dimer.  The work involves massive computations made possible by                
              a combination of recent advances in computer technology and a                  
              new time-dependent quantum wave packet method that has been                    
              developed by Professor Zhang.                                                  
              %%%                                                                            
              The breaking apart of molecules as they are adsorbed on a                      
              surface or their recombination as they leave the surface are                   
              two of the fundamental steps in catalytic processes.  In this                  
              research, Professor Zhang applies a new technique he has                       
              developed to make possible a more realistic study of such                      
              individual chemical steps than has previously been possible.                   
              The present work is limited to hydrogen as the adsorbing gas,                  
              but it will serve as a test of the new theoretical advances                    
              which may be applied to larger systems later as computer                       
              technology advances.  The same theoretical approach is also                    
              being used and further tested in a study of the energy                         
              distribution in the products when the hydrogen bond in the                     
              HF dimer is broken.
