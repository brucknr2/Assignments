Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The oceanographic instrumentation program supports requests to                 
              acquire instrumentation for the collection, processing and                     
              analysis of oceanographic data.  Support for instrumentation                   
              acquisition requests is predicated on share-use by many NSF-                   
              funded researchers.  This proposal from the University of Delaware             
              requests funding for equipment that will be used to support                    
              NSF-funded research cruises aboard the R/V CAPE HENLOPEN, a 120                
              foot vessel that is owned and operated by the University.
