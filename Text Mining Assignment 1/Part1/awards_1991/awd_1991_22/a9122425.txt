Abstract    :
              The basic question addressed in this project is to what extent do              
              family circumstances and events during childhood affect a child's              
              achievements and economic status in young adulthood.  On the                   
              basis of economic and sociological theory, and preliminary                     
              evidence the following childhood circumstances and events are                  
              analyzed: (1) The economic resources of the family which  include              
              income levels, the source of income (whether earned or welfare                 
              transfers), the nature of housing tenure, and the amount of time               
              parents spent with the child;  (2) Stressful events in life such               
              as divorce, separation, death, remarriage, and geographical                    
              changes in residence;  (3) Neighborhood characteristics like the               
              local poverty rate, unemployment, and welfare dependency;  (4)                 
              Educational attainment in terms of years of schooling;  (5)                    
              Economic productivity measured in terms of wage rates and                      
              earnings in post-school full time employment; and (6)  Teenage                 
              pregnancy and welfare dependency for young adult women.                        
                                                                                             
              The purpose of this research is to develop models characterizing               
              the relationship between --family economic resources, family                   
              stress, and neighborhood characteristics when a child-- and                    
              economics success when adult; and then to estimate these models.               
              The models will be drawn from both the economic and sociological               
              literature, and the estimation will employ a data set consisting               
              of 21 years of longitudinal data on 1800 children aged 0-6 in                  
              1968 and their siblings.  The determinants of economic success                 
              will be estimated by fitting statistical models to the data,                   
              moving from the most straightforward regression estimates to                   
              models designed to both capture the sequential nature of                       
              individual decisions and account for inherent limitations of the               
              data.
