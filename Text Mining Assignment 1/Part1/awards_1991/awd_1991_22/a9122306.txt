Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project has two parts.  The first deals with innovation, the              
              second with human capital accumulation of a conventional sort.                 
                                                                                             
              Growth in the most advanced economies is fueled by the development             
              of new products and processes, and growth in the developing world              
              by successful adoption of existing technologies.  The first part               
              of the research is a more systematic examination of the factors                
              that determine the aggregate level of innovative activity in each              
              setting.  Chief among these are the degree of substitutability                 
              among products and the nature of competition in the product market.            
              A key question is under what circumstances a less developed economy            
              will tend to catch up to a more advanced one.                                  
                                                                                             
              During the 1980's real wages in the U.S. rose for professional                 
              workers and stagnated or fell for other groups.  The second part               
              of the research is directed toward explaining the dynamics of the              
              relative wages of skilled and unskilled labor as an economy                    
              develops.  Trade between economies with different mixes of skilled             
              and unskilled labor, and the incentives for skilled and unskilled              
              labor to migrate from less to more developed economies will also               
              be examined.
