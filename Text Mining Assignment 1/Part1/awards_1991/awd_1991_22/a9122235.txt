Abstract    :
              The purpose of this research is to develop a new and powerful                  
              general methodology for posing and answering basic questions                   
              about optimal policies concerning the preservation of biological               
              diversity.  The theory will be broad enough to integrate a wide                
              range of related subjects into a coherent whole, yet operational               
              enough to be useful for addressing practical empirical questions.              
              The theory is centered on the diversity function, a basic dynamic              
              programming equation that measures the diversity of a set of n                 
              objects or species as a function of n(n-1)/2 pair wise variables.              
              This function can be interpreted as determining the possible                   
              genetic distance or dissimilarity, or the probability of species               
              survival, depending on the context and intended application.                   
                                                                                             
              Theoretical applications will include the use of cost-benefit                  
              analysis in analyzing conservation issues, classification theory,              
              maximum likelihood estimation of evolutionary trees, entropy                   
              measures of diversity for ecological settings, the calculation of              
              diversity maximizing policies, and relations with portfolio                    
              diversification theory.  Practical computer packages will be                   
              prepared and applied to a series of actual conservation problems.              
              For example, the methodology will be applied to analyzing issues               
              concerned with the preservation of the 15 exiting species of                   
              cranes.  With the growing world-wide threat to a variety of plant              
              and animal species and their habitats, this research is                        
              particularly timely and important.
