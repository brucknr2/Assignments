Abstract    :
              A NATO International Scientific Exchange Programme Advanced                    
              Research Workshop on the Use of Biomarkers in Assessing Health                 
              and Environmental Impacts will be held in Portugal in June 1992.               
              The objective of the workshop is to develop a conceptual                       
              framework for the use of biomarkers in assessment of human and                 
              environmental health; to review the current state of knowledge of              
              biomarkers; and to formulate the research needs for                            
              implementation and interpretation of biological monitoring                     
              programs to define community health needs.  This proposal is to                
              provide funds to permit more scientists to participate in the                  
              Workshop.
