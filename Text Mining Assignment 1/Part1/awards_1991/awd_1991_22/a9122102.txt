Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project has two parts.  The first part is concerned with developing       
              models for analyzing competition among financial intermediaries.  The          
              role of competition in the banking industry is of particular interest.         
              In contrast to most other countries, the US has a long tradition of            
              encouraging competition among a large number of banks.  Banks have many        
              special features which mean that standard economic analyses of                 
              competition cannot be directly applied.  These special features include        
              their role as information gathering and processing institutions and the        
              fact that there are significant switching costs for customers.  Models         
              which take account of these features and allow their effect on                 
              competition to be analyzed will be developed.  Four areas that the             
              project will focus on are (i) competition and the costs of bank failure;       
              (ii) branch networks and competition; (iii) price-setting competition;         
              (iv) competition and risk-taking behavior by banks.                            
                                                                                             
              In previous work, methods for the analysis of competitive markets with         
              adverse selection were developed.  Adapting ideas developed in the             
              context of games with incomplete information, these techniques allow one       
              to deal easily with situations that might be intractable in an extensive       
              form game.  In the second part of the proposal, these techniques will          
              be extended to dynamic contests and to deal with moral hazard as well          
              as adverse selection.
