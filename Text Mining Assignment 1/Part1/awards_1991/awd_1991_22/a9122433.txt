Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project prepares data sets and codebooks for the seven Euro-              
              Barometer surveys to be carried out in each of the European                    
              Community countries from fall 1990 through fall 1993.  These                   
              countries include Germany (with full-size representative national              
              samples from what used to be both West Germany and East Germany),              
              France, Great Britain, Italy, The Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg,            
              Denmark, Ireland, Greece, Spain and Portugal.  Identical surveys               
              are carried out in these twelve nations each spring and each fall.             
              In addition to processing these surveys, the investigators prepare             
              an updated cumulative file, incorporating those items asked                    
              repeatedly in the European Community surveys from 1970 through                 
              1993.  The investigators will also prepare an integrated dataset               
              for the World Values Survey, combining data from 24 nations                    
              surveyed in 1981-82; together with data from the second wave of                
              this study, carried out in 42 countries in 1990-1991.  These data              
              will be made available to the social science community through the             
              Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research,                 
              Survey Data Archive at the University of Michigan.  Combining                  
              individual-level survey data and national-level socioeconomic and              
              political data from 42 nations on all six inhabited continents,                
              this data base will make it possible to examine the impact of                  
              economic and political events on individual-level orientations; and            
              the consequences that mass attitudes and cultural patterns have for            
              political and social change.
