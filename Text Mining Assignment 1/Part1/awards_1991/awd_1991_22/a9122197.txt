Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              In this project, Dr. Henryk Matyja of the                                      
              Warsaw University of Technology Institute of                                   
              Materials Science and Engineering will perform                                 
              materials research in cooperation with Dr.                                     
              Takeshi Egami of the University of Pennsylvania

              Joint Fund on "Pulse Annealing of Metallic                                     
              Glasses."  Metallic glasses, being                                             
              thermodynamically unstable, undergo structural                                 
              changes upon heating, involving relaxation and                                 
              crystallization.  The researchers will focus on                                
              the effect of rapid Joule heating on the                                       
              following properties:  (1) viscosity,                                          
              relaxation and glass transition; (2)                                           
              crystallization behavior; and (3) atomic                                       
              structure.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              This project in materials research fulfills the                                
              program objectives of advancing scientific                                     
              knowledge by enabling leading experts in the                                   
              U.S. and Poland to combine complementary                                       
              efforts and capabilities in areas of strong                                    
              mutual interest and competence on the basis of                                 
              equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of                                        
              benefit.
