Abstract    :
              Dr. Rouse is tracing the emergence of new images of science and                
              new ways of conceptualizing and investigating scientific                       
              knowledge from criticism of philosophical and sociological                     
              disputes over realism and the rationality of science.  These                   
              disputes typically presume a conception of scientific knowledge                
              as a body of representations whose content and relation to the                 
              world must be explained, whether by reasons and evidence                       
              "internal" to science, or "external" social and practical                      
              embodiment of scientific knowledge and its temporal dynamics.                  
              Dr. Rouse believes that these disputes oversimplify and distort                
              the political and cultural significance of the sciences in their               
              attempt to vindicate or challenge the legitimacy of the                        
              scientific enterprise.  Dr. Rouse is attempting to develop a more              
              adequate account of these aspects of the sciences, using his                   
              account to criticize directly the concepts of the "content" of                 
              scientific knowledge and the "ontological status" of its objects               
              which are at issue in the rationality and realism disputes.  He                
              aims to show how the positions in these disputes derive their                  
              apparent significance from their place within what he sees as                  
              problematic cultural conflicts over the "legitimacy of the modern              
              age."
