Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The oceanographic instrumentation program supports requests to                 
              acquire instrumentation for the collection, processing and analysis            
              of oceanographic data.  This proposal from Texas A&M University                
              requests funding for equipment that will be used to support NSF-               
              funded research cruises on several of the ships in the                         
              oceanographic fleet, particularly the MOANA WAVE, the THOMAS                   
              WASHINGTON and the NEW HORIZON.                                                
                                                                                             
              The PI's propose to collaborate with scientists at the University              
              of Hawaii and Scripps Institute of Oceanography to upgrade the                 
              digital seismic systems used at all three institutions.  The                   
              upgraded systems will consist of a SUN SPARCstation with output to             
              either 8mm or 4mm tape.  The new systems will be significantly                 
              smaller and more portable than the current systems, and the storage            
              media (Exabyte or DAT tapes) will be cheaper and significantly                 
              smaller than the currently used storage media (9-track tapes).                 
              Three systems will be developed and made available for use by the              
              scientific community.
