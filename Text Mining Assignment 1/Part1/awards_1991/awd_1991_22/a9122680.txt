Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Board on Chemical Sciences and Technology of the National                  
              Research Council will carry out a comprehensive assessment of                  
              research opportunities and needs in the field of polymer science               
              and engineering.  The field has evolved dramatically in the ten                
              years since the 1981 report, "Polymer Science and Engineering:                 
              Challenges, Needs and Opportunities."  There is a clear need to                
              define the current research frontiers, the matching research needs             
              and opportunities for chemists, chemical engineers, biologists,                
              materials scientists, and the corresponding funding priorities that            
              will be essential for planning and decisions by funding agencies.              
              The proposed study will be carried out by a committee of 15 experts            
              established by the Board.  It is estimated that the study will take            
              12 months to complete at a cost of $200,000 of which $75,000 is                
              being provided by the National Science Foundation.  The National               
              Science Foundation Divisions participating are the Division of                 
              Materials Research, Division of Molecular Biosciences, Division of             
              Chemical and Thermal Systems, and the Division of Chemistry.
