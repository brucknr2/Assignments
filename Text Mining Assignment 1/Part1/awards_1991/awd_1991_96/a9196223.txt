Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              The potential impacts of sea level rise on                                     
              estuarine environments, especially the threat                                  
              of saline intrusion, will be examined by                                       
              mathematically simulating the time-varying                                     
              tidal height, currents and salinity.  With                                     
              measurements from a selected estuary                                           
              parametric studies will be conducted on                                        
              projected sea level rise, stream flow, storm                                   
              surge, channel roughness, and change in cross-                                 
              section profile in order to garner an in-depth                                 
              understanding of estuarine processes.  The                                     
              study will examine present conditions versus                                   
              possible future sea levels, and with and                                       
              without some control measures.  The results of                                 
              this work will be applicable to other                                          
              estuaries and used in estuarine management and                                 
              river basin planning.
