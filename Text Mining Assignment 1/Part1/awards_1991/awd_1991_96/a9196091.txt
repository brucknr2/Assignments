Abstract    :
              The goal of the proposed studies is to understand the                          
              function of the X chromosome and X-chromosome inactivation                     
              (XCI) during mammalian spermatogenesis, and the relation of                    
              these events to meiosis and spermatogenic differentiation.                     
              Since abnormalities in either structure or number of X                         
              chromosomes almost inevitably result in male (but not female)                  
              sterility, the cycle of X-chromosome activity in male germ                     
              cells is likely to be an integral, controlling element of                      
              their meiotic activity and differentiation.  The development                   
              time of X-chromosome expression and XCI during                                 
              spermatogenesis will be determined to test the hypothesis                      
              that XCI coincides with the onset of meiosis.  The genetic                     
              extent of XCI will be examined to test the hypothesis that                     
              inactivation includes genes in the non-pairing region, but                     
              not those in the pairing region, of the X chromosome.  The                     
              genetic control of XCI will be investigated to determine if                    
              it is controlled from a single site on the chromosome and to                   
              test the hypothesis that it is not associated with                             
              hypermethylation of regulatory sequences.  The expression of                   
              X-linked genes will be investigated in sterile mouse mutants                   
              to determine if the deleterious effect of supernumerary X                      
              chromosomes on spermatogonia is due to failure of dosage                       
              compensation and if the lethal effect of structural                            
              abnormalities of the X chromosome on spermatocytes is due to                   
              failure of XCI.                                                                
                                                                                             
              These studies will lead to more complete understanding of the                  
              biological role of sex chromosomes during male meiosis and                     
              germ cell differentiation.
