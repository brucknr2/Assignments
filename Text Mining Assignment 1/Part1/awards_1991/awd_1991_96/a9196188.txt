Abstract    :
                   This experimental study is designed to test several                       
              assumptions and predictions of genetic models used to explain the              
              coevolution of plant resistance to pathogens and pathogen                      
              virulence on hosts.  These models indicate that stabilizing                    
              selection can maintain genetic variation in host-plant resistance              
              and pathogen virulence when these traits are each accompanied by               
              pleiotropic fitness costs.  Unfortunately, little evidence is                  
              available about the costs to plants of pathogen-resistance; nor                
              is there conclusive evidence that virulence is costly to                       
              pathogens.  Moreover, genetic modifier theory suggests that many               
              such traits may not be costly.                                                 
              The experiments have two main objectives: (1) determine the                    
              genetic mechanisms underlying virulence in the fungal pathogen                 
              Colletorichum dematium and resistance in its host, the tall                    
              morning glory, Ipomoea purpurea, and (2) observe patterns of                   
              selection on virulence and resistance traits in these species.                 
              Results from these experiments will test three important                       
              assumptions of plant-pathogen coevolutionary theory: (1)                       
              Pathogens impose selection on their host plants, (2) Stabilizing               
              selection maintains genetic variation for both resistance and                  
              virulence characters, (3) Resistance to pathogens is costly.                   
              Findings will contribute directly to ecological theory and will                
              add substantially to basic knowledge which can be used for                     
              problems in the applied ecology of disease management.
