Abstract    :
              College faculty are learning how computer algebra systems can be               
              used to improve calculus curricula and are designing new curricula             
              that will integrate laboratories into the new courses.  The new                
              designs will be implemented during the academic year following the             
              workshop will be critiqued and redesigned at a follow-up workshop              
              the next summer.
