Abstract    :
                      This project focusses on the analysis of visual motion for             
              tasks such as navigation through the environment and manipulation              
              of objects.  The work will be based on previous research over the              
              past five years, addressing the problems of motion measurement                 
              and recovery of three-dimensional (3-D) structure from relative                
              motion.  Future efforts will first examine three fundamental                   
              problems:  First, the extraction of qualitative properties of 3-D              
              structure and motion to facilitate fast locomotion through the                 
              environment; second, the extension of current structure-from-                  
              motion methods to allow the interpretation of a greater range of               
              nonrigid motions, and third, the design of parallel networks to                
              recover 3-D structure, which will facilitate the testing of                    
              algorithms with natural image motion sequences.  The thrust of                 
              this research will continue to combine theoretical analyses of                 
              these problems, the design and testing of algorithms, and                      
              observations regarding the analysis of motion by the human visual              
              system.
