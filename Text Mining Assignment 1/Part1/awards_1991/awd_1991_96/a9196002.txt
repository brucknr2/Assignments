Abstract    :
                   The proposed study is intended to examine the planetary-                  
              scale aspects of the solar-QBO (quasi-biannual oscillation)                    
              effects, continuing the more general work reported earlier.                    
              Specifically, this study will attempt to provide evidence for a                
              driver mechanism, in which planetary scale waves act as a                      
              "carrier" or "amplifier" of the QBO signal. Suitable indices of                
              planetary wave activity will be used to explore the relationships              
              between solar, tropospheric, and QBO variations. It is expected                
              that if planetary waves are the prime agents of a sun-weather                  
              mechanism, they may provide a better diagnostic of the mechanism               
              than the use of a composite solar flux-QBO index, which has                    
              provided much of the information up to date.***//
