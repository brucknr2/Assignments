Abstract    :
              Numerical simulations will be carried out to predict organized                 
              vortex structures in three dimensions relevant to plane wakes and              
              round jets.  Issues to be addressed are stability mechanisms and               
              three-dimensional interactions for these vortex structures.  The               
              numerical procedure is based on Lagrangian vortex dynamics.                    
              These methods do not introduce numerical grid effects. The focus               
              is on mechanisms which might ultimately be used to control the                 
              stability of wakes and jets.
