Abstract    :
              The objective of the proposed research is characterization of                  
              ultrathin (<150A) silicon nitride and oxynitride insulators formed by          
              high dosage, low energy (<5 keV) implantation of nitrogen or nitrogen          
              and oxygen into single crystal silicon.  Samples will be evaluated             
              with measurements of junction capacitance and conductance (as                  
              functions of voltage and frequency), current vs. voltage,                      
              ellipsometry, Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), accelerated life              
              testing, and electrical stressing and breakdown.  Use of a temporary           
              mercury contact will permit evaluation of the insulator alone,                 
              including variations of implantation and annealing conditions; and             
              evaluation of films with various metals as gate contacts.  Computer            
              controlled measurements will permit extensive data acquisition and             
              analysis.
