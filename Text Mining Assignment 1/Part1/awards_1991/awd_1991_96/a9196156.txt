Abstract    :
              Puerto Rico faces two major natural hazards: hurricanes                        
              (and related wind and water damage) and earthquakes.  This                     
                                                                                             
              research deals with response to multiple natural hazards                       
              in Puerto Rico following the experience of homeowners with                     
                                                                                             
              Hurricane Hugo in 1989.  The research will focus on the                        
              impacts of direct or indirect experience with hurricane                        
              damage on the adoption of subsequent mitigation measures.                      
                                                                                             
              It involves a survey of a geographically stratified sample                     
                                                                                             
              of homeowners, and the spatial and statistical analysis of                     
                                                                                             
              responses using a geographic information system.  We will                      
              be able to test for the impact of geographic location of                       
              the household as well as family connections with                               
              households in areas that suffered damage on attitudes                          
              towards risk and the purchase of flood insurance, as well                      
              as earthquake insurance beyond that mandated by lenders.                       
              We will explore the relationship of the perception of                          
              hurricane risk with perceptions and preparedness for the                       
              other major natural hazard facing Puerto Rico -                                
              earthquakes.
