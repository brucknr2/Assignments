Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The long-term stability of slopes can change                                   
              due to a progressive reduction in the shear                                    
              strength parameters.  Seasonal cycles of                                       
              wetting and drying and fluctuations in the                                     
              water table may contribute to the gradual                                      
              reduction in the shear strength of natural                                     
              cohesive soils thus, increasing the                                            
              probability of landslides.  The study will                                     
              examine the effects of these environmental                                     
              loadings and the reduction in shear strength                                   
              of natural claystones, cohesive colluvium and                                  
              cohesive alluvium, and on the long-term                                        
              stability of slopes in or affected by these                                    
              materials.  Ring shear tests will be used to                                   
              measure the accumulation of permanent shear                                    
              deformation and the subsequent degradation in                                  
              shear strength.  Laboratory data will be                                       
              applied to documented landslide case histories                                 
              to validate the research conclusions.  The                                     
              results will be the basis for the development                                  
              of mitigation measures.
