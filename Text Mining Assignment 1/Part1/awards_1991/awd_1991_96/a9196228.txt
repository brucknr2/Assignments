Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal is to develop and test mathematical models of the                
              growth and decline of organizations.  Five models, differing in                
              details of processes internal to organizations and of their                    
              external surrounding, are proposed.  The goal is to understand                 
              forces shaping organizational structures over long time spans,                 
              and to provide a theoretical structure for explaining how or-                  
              ganizational change produces changes in society.  The work grows               
              out of previous work by the PI and collaborators.  PI will                     
              evaluate models by comparison with data on the founding, growth,               
              and mortality of diverse industries: labor unions, banks, life                 
              insurance firms, and breweries.  The project seeks to develop a                
              set of theories and methodological tools cutting across specific               
              types of organizations, for use in further studies of organi-                  
              zational ecology.
