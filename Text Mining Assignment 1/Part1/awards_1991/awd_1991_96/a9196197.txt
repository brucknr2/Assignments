Abstract    :
                   The Isthmus of Panama emerged about 2.8-3.2 million years                 
              ago.  It formed a major marine barrier splitting the American                  
              tropical ocean into two new realms with profoundly different                   
              ocean circulation, salinity, temperature and nutrients.  It also               
              connected two hitherto separate and different terrestrial faunas               
              and floras.  It was perhaps the single most important oceanic,                 
              climatic and biogeographic event in the last 60 million years.                 
                   This project will locate and describe the sedimentary strata              
              on each side of the isthmus dating from about 6 million years to               
              the present.  Using micro and macro fossils Dr. Coates and his                 
              colleagues will date the sequence of sediments and attempt to                  
              establish the precise time of final closure of the isthmus.  The               
              project entails 1) collecting and section measuring field                      
              expeditions, 2) large-scale sample processing to extract                       
              specimens, 3) identifying and describing species, 4) assigning                 
              ages and paleoenvironments to the strata and fossils, 5) entering              
              all this information into a specially designed computer database.              
                   The database generated will be unique in its potential to                 
              address some fundamental questions in biology, such as the causes              
              and patterns of origination and extinction of species in a                     
              variety of marine animals and plants, related to a specific major              
              environmental event.
