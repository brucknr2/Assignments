Abstract    :
                   This award to Florida International University's Department               
              of Geology is made in response to a proposal submitted to the                  
              National Science Foundation's Instrumentation and Laboratory                   
              Improvement Program. The award will provide one-half of the funds              
              needed to acquire an image analysis system for the purpose of                  
              enhancing education and research in the Department's                           
              undergraduate training programs. The University is committed to                
              providing fifty percent matching funds for this acquisition.                   
                   The equipment will be used in the Department's microscopy                 
              laboratory exercises in courses in mineralogy, petrology and                   
              paleontology. The image analysis system will also be used in the               
              Department's undergraduate research program to enhance modal                   
              analysis of rocks, analysis of deformation fabrics in                          
              metamorphosed rocks, and morphological analysis of evolution in                
              microfossils.
