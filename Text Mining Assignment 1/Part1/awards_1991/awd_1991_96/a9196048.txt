Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to investigate the influence of               
              chirality on phase transitions in liquid crystals through the use              
              of optical activity and light scattering measurements.  Previous               
              work has demonstrated that high chirality has a significant                    
              effect on the isotropic to liquid crystal phase transition, both               
              increasing the complexity of the pretransitional effects and                   
              weakening the transition itself.  The project seeks to extend                  
              this work by (1) performing similar optical activity experiments               
              in a different liquid crystal system, including measurements at                
              lower chirality in both the isotropic and blue phases, (2)                     
              utilizing light scattering as a new probe into the complex                     
              fluctuation phenomena which take place near transitons involving               
              chiral phases, and (3) investigating three liquid crystal to                   
              liquid crystal transtions in chiral systems (smectic A - smectic               
              C*, chiral nematic - smectic A, and chiral nematic - smectic C*).              
              The same techniques used to study the isotropic to liquid crystal              
              transition should reveal new information about the effect of                   
              chirality on these phase transitions.
