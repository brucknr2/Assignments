Abstract    :
                   The primary objective of this research is to find the                     
              dimension and bases for certain classes of splines.  the                       
              principal investigator will use methods of algebra,                            
              combinatorics, homology and computer algebra.  In particular, the              
              spline spaces can be described as vector spaces and modules.                   
              Techniques from homology theory and combinatorics will be used to              
              discern properties of these spaces.  Generating sets for modules               
              of splines will be computed using recent techniques in computer                
              algebra.//
