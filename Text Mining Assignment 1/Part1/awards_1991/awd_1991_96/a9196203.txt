Abstract    :
                   Both C02 and 03 have profound effects on plant growth,                    
              physiology and biochemistry.  Given that levels of each gas are                
              increasing and will continue to increase, this may result in                   
              substantial impact on the function and productivity of plants in               
              natural and agroecosystems.  Research is proposed on the                       
              interactive effects of elevated levels of both C02 and 03 on six               
              perennial canopy dominants of the forests and prairies of the                  
              Midwest.                                                                       
                   The study species differ in intrinsic characteristics that                
              may result in differing response to atmospheric pollutants.  The               
              species differ in growth form stomatal conductance and                         
              photosynthetic pathway.  The investigators will test the                       
              hypothesis that elevated levels of C02 will partially ameliorate               
              the deleterious effects of 03.  They will also test a number of                
              other hypotheses relating growth form, stomatal conductance and                
              photosynthetic pathway to pollutant response.  In general, among               
              all species, if there are significant interactions between 03 and              
              C02, rather than a strictly additive combined response, this will              
              suggest that the impacts of continued elevation of the                         
              atmospheric concentrations of these two gases on plant                         
              physiological behavior may be exceedingly complex and difficult                
              to either predict or monitor.                                                  
                   The results of this research will be important to our basic               
              understanding of the relationships of certain physiological "life              
              history" traits to a changing atmospheric environment.  In                     
              addition, they should help focus our national policy and research              
              priorities by adding to the small but growing data base                        
              addressing the response of natural systems to a rapidly shifting               
              atmospheric composition.
