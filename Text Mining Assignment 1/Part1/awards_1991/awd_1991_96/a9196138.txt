Abstract    :
              The quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) can be used to monitor the               
              formation of coatings at solution-metal interfaces, the                        
              adsorption of species from solution onto polymer supports, and                 
              solvation and ion-exchange reactions in polymer thin films.  The               
              choice of polymer coating and film architecture are crucial to                 
              the design of QCM-based sensors for analytical applications.  The              
              apparatus will be constructed and exploratory research will                    
              begin.  The first objective of the proposed research is to                     
              establish boundary conditions for designing polymer-coated quartz              
              crystals for QCM-based sensors.  The second objective is to                    
              determine the applicability of the QCM for obtaining fundamental               
              insights into polymer adsorption kinetics and polymer adlayer                  
              structure.   It will be determined whether the QCM can be used to              
              measure the microviscosity of polymers at the polymer-metal                    
              interface, whether the QCM can be used to monitor swelling or ion              
              transport in non-rigid polymer films, and whether the device can               
              be used to monitor polymer adsorption directly.  This is a Career              
              Advancement Award under the Research Opportunity for Women
