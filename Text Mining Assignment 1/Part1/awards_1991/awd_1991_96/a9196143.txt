Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The accretion of island arcs onto continental margins is an                    
              important mechanism for continental growth, and explains much of               
              the complexity of terranes surrounding the Pacific Ocean. Drs.                 
              Lundberg, Reed and Shor will survey a collision in progress                    
              immediately south of Taiwan, where an arc system ofthe Phillipine              
              Sea is colliding with the China main land. Cruise plans include                
              26 days of SeaMarcII swath mapping, digitalsingle-channel                      
              seismics, 3.5 KHz echo sounding, gravity and magnetic                          
              measurements, plus 3 days of piston coring. Immediate objectives               
              are to map deep (seismic) and shallow (topographic) structural                 
              features, sediment lithofacies and sediment transport systems                  
              across the collision zone.  Because of the oblique natureof the                
              collisional front, along-strike comparisons provide"snapshot"                  
              views of the evolution of arc-continent collisions. Consequently,              
              studies will include spatial and temporal comparisons of the                   
              effects of over burden and sediment distribution.
