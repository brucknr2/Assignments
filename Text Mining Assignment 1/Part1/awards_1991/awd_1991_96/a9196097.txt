Abstract    :
              Rapidly increasing immigration into the United States has spawned much         
              public debate and also legislation to regulate the inflow.  This               
              phenomenon has also stimulated a growing literature on the economics of        
              immigration which has focused on trying to better understand the causes        
              and consequences immigration.  The purpose of this research is to              
              extend and deepen our understanding of immigration in two directions.          
              One part of the study will examine the economic success of immigrants          
              over an extended period from 1940 through 1980.  The other part will           
              extend a theoretical model of migration to account for return                  
              migration.                                                                     
              The first part of the study will involve jointly analyzing the                 
              performance of immigrants in the U.S. labor market in the five Census          
              from 1940 through 1980.  This approach allows for a clearer                    
              interpretation of the role played by the 1965 Amendments to the                
              Immigration and Nationality Act, as well as avoids some of the biases          
              that have affected other studies.  The second part will generalize an          
              economic model of immigration to allow for the possibility that                
              incoming migrants change their minds, and thus return migration flows          
              are generated.  This model will be tested using the Census Public Use          
              Files, published Immigration and Naturalization Service data, and the          
              Aliens Legally Admitted for Permanent Residence micro data.
