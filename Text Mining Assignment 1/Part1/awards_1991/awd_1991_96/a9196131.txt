Abstract    :
              This award supports a study of the potential of                                
              thermoluminescence (TL) to date high Arctic deglacial marine                   
              sediments.  A suite of modern and, independently dated, early                  
              Holocene and Late Quaternary sediments were specifically collected             
              from western Spitsbergen to explore new TL methods to date                     
              deglacial sequences, as well as to test the accuracy, precision                
              and temporal limitations of the technique.  This research is                   
              designed to provide needed insight into the basic TL properties of             
              sediments and to develop procedures that can routinely date                    
              sediments.  The focus of laboratory studies will be to gain a                  
              better understanding of which particle size and mineralogic                    
              component yield the most chronologically sensitive and stable TL               
              signal.  This study will outline the fundamental basis for                     
              extending the TL method to Arctic deglacial marine-sediments,                  
              ultimately providing a new method for constraining the timing of               
              Late and Middle Quaternary Arctic glaciations.
