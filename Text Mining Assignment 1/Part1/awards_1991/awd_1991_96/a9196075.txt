Abstract    :
               This research is to investigate the transition zone structures                
              in the upper mantle with emphasis on the 400 km and 670 km                     
              discontinuity.  Recent advances in mineral physics have given a                
              new urgency to the accurate characterization of elastic structure              
              for such boundaries, as well as to the search for other                        
              discontinuities.  By using broad band seismograms for a number of              
              deep focus earthquakes, and incorporating a suite of reflected                 
              and converted phases with varying ray parameters, the work will                
              separate the effects of wave speed and density contrast, as well               
              as measuring sharpness.  The results have important implications               
              for global geodynamics and mantle convection, the driving force                
              of the crustal plates.
