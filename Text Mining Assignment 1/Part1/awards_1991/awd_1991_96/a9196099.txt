Abstract    :
                This research will address the controversial topic of the                    
              extent that slabs at subduction zones extend into the lower                    
              mantle.  The research will utilize data from the International                 
              Seismic Centre travel times, the Harvard Centroid Moment Tensor                
              catalog, and waveform analysis techniques to map velocity                      
              structure and seismic strain rates at subduction zones throughout              
              the world.  The question of extent of slabs into the lower mantle              
              is critical to models of convection within the mantle which is                 
              the ultimate driving force for plate tectonics.
