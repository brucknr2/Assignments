Abstract    :
                   Research is in statistical mechanics with emphasis on                     
              systems with quenched disorder.  Topics include fundamental                    
              issues in the theory of random field and spin-glass models,                    
              localization effects and extended states for random operators,                 
              and other questions concerning time evolution and critical                     
              behaviour.
