Abstract    :
              A large number of facilities are becoming available for                        
              observations in the submillimeter wavelength region of the                     
              electromagnetic spectrum.  Several new highly accurate                         
              telescopes have begun operating at dry, high altitude sites.                   
              Dr. Sutton has constructed a receiver, for work at submillimeter               
              wavelengths, which is one of the best available.  The confluence               
              of this technological advance in receiver design with the                      
              proliferation of telescopes promises exciting astronomical                     
              accomplishments over the next few years.                                       
                                                                                             
              This grant will support Dr. Sutton's astronomical research using               
              the receiver he built for operation at frequencies around 345                  
              GHz.  The instrumentation will be further improved and used to                 
              address a variety of astronomical problems, particularly in the                
              areas of galactic structure, interstellar chemistry, and regions               
              of star formation.  At least initially, the receiver will be                   
              operated on the 10.4 meter diameter telescope of the California                
              Institute of Technology Submillimeter Observatory located on                   
              Mauna Kea, Hawaii.
