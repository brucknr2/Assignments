Abstract    :
              Dr. Oliver demonstrated earlier that when dried moss is rehydrated a           
              unique set of proteins are synthesized very early in the plant's               
              recovery phase (it only takes a few hours for the moss to regain its           
              normal metabolic activities).  The PI believes that these are the              
              proteins that are involved in the repair of the water-stress induced           
              damage.  Dr. Oliver also determined that the synthesis of some of the          
              major proteins that are made under normal conditions is dramatically           
              decreased during this recovery period.  The work that the PI intends to        
              complete over the period of the grant will be aimed at elucidating how         
              this switch in the pattern of protein synthesis is accomplished.  This         
              is the first step in understanding the genetic basis of a naturally            
              occurring desiccation-tolerance mechanism.                                     
                                                                                             
              This research is important to understand the mechanism by which this           
              plant is able to withstand severe drought.  Drought is a major                 
              environmental problem that causes millions of dollars loss some place          
              in the U.S. every year.  This research may elucidate the mechanism that        
              allows some plants to withstand drought much better than others.
