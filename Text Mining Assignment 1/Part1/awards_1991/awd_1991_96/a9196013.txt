Abstract    :
                   Professor Moy will investigate the unitarity question in the              
              representation theory of certain kinds of groups.  His work will               
              focus on unipotent representations, reducibility problems related              
              to unitarity, and the relationship of certain Hecke algebra                    
              isomorphisms to unitarity.                                                     
                   Group theory is basically the study of symmetry.  To take a               
              simple example, when the system in question is invariant under a               
              change in the position of the origin of space, the group of                    
              translations naturally arises.  While groups are abstract                      
              objects, particular situations demand concrete realizations or                 
              "representations" of the symmetry group.  Professor Moy's                      
              investigations involve certain special representations which                   
              enjoy a distance preserving property called unitarity.
