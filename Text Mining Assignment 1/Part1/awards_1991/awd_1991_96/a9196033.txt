Abstract    :
                   Work to be done during the period of this award will focus                
              on higher dimensional inverse scattering problems and on related               
              one dimensional problems.  The underlying idea for work of this                
              nature is that of constructing obstacles from data measured as                 
              particles pass the obstacle.  The transition from the future of a              
              solution of, say, the wave equation, to the past is called the                 
              scattering transform.  Knowledge of either the transform or its                
              spectrum is considered to be central to understanding any wave or              
              generalized wave which experiences scattering.                                 
                   This work will consider extending results on time dependent               
              Schrodinger equations with slowly decaying potentials in which                 
              the inverse equation admits simple poles.  In higher dimensional               
              settings the advent of multiple poles cannot be ruled  out.                    
              However, their structure is not understood.  The question  of                  
              whether or not they may accumulate will also be studied.                       
              One method to be used will consider solutions for time                         
              dependent Schrodinger equations which are not necessarily bounded              
              in time.  This method has been used to achieve the complete                    
              solution (for all potentials) for the one dimensional nxn inverse              
              scattering problem as well as for the one dimensional n-th order               
              scalar equation.  Several classical equations and systems are                  
              expected to be analyzed using results developed through this                   
              investigation.  They include the Zakharov-Shabat system and the                
              KPI equation.
