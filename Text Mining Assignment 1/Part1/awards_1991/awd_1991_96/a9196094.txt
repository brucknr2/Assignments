Abstract    :
                   The User Interface Design Environment, UIDE, is a tool which              
              assists in user interface design, prototyping, testing, and                    
              implementation.  The heart of UIDE is a knowledge base                         
              representation of the conceptual design of a user interface.  A                
              set of user interface design alternatives which can be applied to              
              the knowledge base a have been defined.  The transformed                       
              interface can be implemented via a User Interface Management                   
              System (UIMS).  The capabilities of the system will be developed               
              in the following ways: (1)  Extend the logical structure of the                
              knowledge base, to make it more useful and powerful.  (2)                      
              Incorporated more sophisticated transformations.  (3)                          
              Automatically organize menus and dialogue boxes.  (4)  Evaluate                
              the interface design with respect to speed of use, using a key-                
              stroke model analysis.  (5) Provide intelligent help to the end                
              user, especially "help by showing". (6) Support interactive                    
              specification of the knowledge base by the user interface                      
              designer, including checks for consistency and completeness.
