Abstract    :
              A laser Doppler velocimeter will be acquired for the research                  
              program on the hydrodynamics, interphase transport and chemical                
              kinetics of phase transfer catalysis.  The goal of the research is             
              to develop quantitative models and methods for the study of                    
              catalysis and related processes.                                               
                                                                                             
              The proposed velocimeter will complete the equipment used at the               
              University of Southern California, Department of Chemical                      
              Engineering, to develop new organic synthesis techniques.
