Abstract    :
                   This research is concerned with phase transitions and                     
              critical phenomena.  The principal investigator, in                            
              collaboration with D.  Abraham, recently introduced and exactly                
              soluble model of three dimensional wetting; they plan to study                 
              some of the remaining open problems in this random surface                     
              model including the issue of surface roughening.  Professor                    
              Newman proposes to extend his joint work on percolation in half                
              spaces with D. Barsky and G. Grimmett, in order to prove                       
              continuity of the percolation transition in full spaces.  He                   
              also intends to study with C. Wu related problems in inverse                   
              square models.  Professor Newman plans to investigate the use                  
              of percolation theoretic methods, which have been very fruitful                
              in the study of ferromagnetic phase transitions, for the                       
              analysis of short range spin glasses.
