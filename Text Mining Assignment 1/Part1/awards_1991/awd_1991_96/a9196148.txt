Abstract    :
              This award provides support to Dr. Mark S. Mizruchi under the                  
              National Science Foundation's Young Presidential Awards program.               
              The objectives of this program are to provide research support to              
              the Nation's most outstanding and promising young science and                  
              engineering faculty.  The awards are intended to improve the                   
              capability of U.S. academic institutions to respond to the demand              
              for highly qualified science and engineering personnel for                     
              academic and industrial research and teaching. This award will                 
              allow the investigator to pursue his research in the application               
              of social network ideas to issues in organizational theory and                 
              political sociology.  Much of his work focuses on the behavior of              
              large corporations.  He is interested in the factors that                      
              determine the types of government policies supported by                        
              businesses.  Dr. Mizruchi's focus is on the ways in which factors              
              such as market constraint exerted by one firm over another and                 
              the number of common institutional shareholders determine whether              
              a pair of firms will support the same policy.  He is also                      
              concerned with the methods corporations use to handle their                    
              capital needs.  The focus is on whether representatives of                     
              financial institutions join the boards of nonfinancial                         
              corporations when the latter are in financial difficulty, as well              
              as the types of alternatives that are available to capital-                    
              dependent firms and the factors that influence how capital is                  
              raised.
