Abstract    :
              This Research Initiation Award is made to develop stable, accurate             
              and efficient computational models for large deformations of metals            
              and composites.  The finite element method with arbitrary                      
              Lagrangian-Eulerian kinematic description will be implemented for              
              industrial forming processes.
