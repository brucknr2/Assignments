Abstract    :
              Several problems of a geometric nature are related by the notion of            
              "coherence".  That is, let (P1,P2,...) be a sequence of instances of           
              the same problem with the property that the input data of instances Pi         
              and Pi+1 differ only slightly.  Exploitation-of-coherence is the               
              algorithmic simplification arising from computing the solution Pi,             
              rather than solving Pi+1 from scratch.  In this project a systematic           
              study of exploitation-of-coherence is made, trying to capitalize on            
              existing isolated findings and aiming significant contributions to             
              important applied areas -- such as robotics and graphics.  Both                
              sequential and parallel methods will be considered.
