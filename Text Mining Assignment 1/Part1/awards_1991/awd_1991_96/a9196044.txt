Abstract    :
                   Professor Conway will investigate several topics in the                   
              theory of subnormal operators and in several variable operator                 
              theory.  Some of these questions are related to the recent                     
              breakthrough of J.E. Thomson showing that bounded point                        
              evaluations exist in interesting cases.  Another question                      
              involves finding a functional calculus for subnormal n-tuples of               
              operators.                                                                     
                   This research involves the theory of Hilbert space                        
              operators.  These operators are essentially infinite matrices of               
              complex numbers. Such objects have applications in every area of               
              applied science as well as in pure mathematics.  This type of                  
              research is an attempt to classify certain important classes of                
              these operators.
