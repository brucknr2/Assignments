Abstract    :
              This is a proposal to develop microbiosensors that can                         
              measure biochemical substances at the cellular level.                          
              Substances whose activity is to be measured include                            
              ascorbic acid, free fatty acids, free radicals and                             
              superoxide dismutase.  The sensor is based on the PI's                         
              previously developed miniature oxygen, hydrogen peroxide,                      
              and pH electrodes.  The tip of the micropipette                                
              containing the electrodes will be covered with a                               
              membrane; the micropipette will be filled with                                 
              appropriate commercial enzymes that are selected on the                        
              basis of the substance to be measured.  Since oxygen-                          
              derived free radicals are known to damage vital tissues,                       
              sensors to measure substances associated with free                             
              radical activity could substantially contribute to the                         
              gaining of basic knowledge aimed at preventing and                             
              treating oxygen-related injury.
