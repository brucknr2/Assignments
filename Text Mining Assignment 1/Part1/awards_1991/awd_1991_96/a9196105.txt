Abstract    :
                   Predation and competition play an important role in the                   
              structure of communities in many different ecosystems.  The                    
              importance of these biotic interactions in the structure of                    
              stream communities remains a pressing question in community                    
              ecology.  this question will be examined in two large arrays of                
              replicated experimental streams; one of 16 streams and one of 24               
              streams, and in a program of field sampling and field experiments              
              at Mountain Lake Biological Station.  The experimental streams                 
              are constructed to mimic the pool an driffle habitats                          
              respectively of Appalacian mountain streams.  Several benthic                  
              species common in these streams will be used.  Etheostoma                      
              flabellare, Eurycea bislineata, Cottus bairdi, and Gyrinophilus                
              porphyriticus, along with the midwater predator Salvelinus                     
              fontinalis, to assemble complex communities.  This will be the                 
              first large-scale in lotic ecosystems.  This program of research               
              will enable stream ecologists to better interpret patterns of                  
              distribution and abundance of species in small streams and to                  
              better understand the large body of data on habitat segregation                
              and microhabitat use patterns in stream communities.
