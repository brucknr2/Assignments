Abstract    :
                   This project is directed at various topics in theoretical                 
              high energy astrophysics, dealing primarily with phenomena in                  
              the vicinity of astronomical compact objects such as neutron                   
              stars, white dwarfs, and active galactic nuclei.  It includes                  
              models of cosmic gamma-ray burst sources toward understanding                  
              the origin of the optical flashes that are occasionally                        
              detected from these systems; models of the class of cosmic X-                  
              ray burst sources whose spectra may be used to infer the                       
              properties of accretion disks in these systems; studying the                   
              evolution of compact binary stars, such as magnetic cataclysmic                
              variables, in which the coupling of the white dwarf's magnetic                 
              field to the companion star affects the binary's evolutionary                  
              history; and studying the nuclei of active galaxies.                           
                                                                                             
              This work should increase our understanding of the basic                       
              physical processes that govern the dynamics of the exotic                      
              astrophysical objects cited.  While no specific applicability                  
              to terrestrial systems is anticipated, some of these processes                 
              are of interest in other areas as well.
