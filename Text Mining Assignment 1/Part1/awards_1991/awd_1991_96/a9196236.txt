Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The application of magnetotellurics (MIT) will be used for the                 
              exploration and interpretation of oceanic basement. By using new               
              analytical methods, MI data from 13 different areas will be                    
              interpreted and synthesized in terms of the nature of the oceanic              
              basement within a single tectonic element, i.e. the Pacific                    
              Ocean.
