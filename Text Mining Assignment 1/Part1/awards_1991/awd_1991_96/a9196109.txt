Abstract    :
                   Fold-thrust belts are formed as a result of translation of a              
              wedge of sedimentary rocks along a system of interconnected                    
              faults that include decollement flats, frontal ramps, and lateral              
              connectors (such as transverse faults, lateral ramps, and zones                
              of displacement transfer).  Lateral connectors are commonly                    
              aligned across strike of the fold-thrust belt; the transverse                  
              alignments of lateral connectors have been called cross-strike                 
              structural discontinuities (CSDs).  CSDs are common features of                
              fold-thrust belts and are potentially significant in exploration               
              for petroleum, ground water, and ore deposits.  The internal                   
              geometry and kinematics of the complete length of CSDs are not                 
              well known.  Lateral connectors and CSDs are as important in the               
              overall make-up of fold-thrust belts as frontal ramps, but the                 
              lateral connectors have been much less studied.  Detailed studies              
              of structure and stratigraphy within a CSD are designed to                     
              address the following important questions:  whether or not inter-              
              nal structural components of CSDs are systematically arrayed                   
              along the trend or with respect to stratigraphic and/or                        
              structural levels; whether or not CSDs are genetically linked to               
              pre-thrust structures (basement faults), to stratigraphic varia-               
              tions caused by synsedimentary pre-thrust structures, and/or                   
              structures in the autochthon; and how CSDs function kinematically              
              within a fold-thrust belt.
