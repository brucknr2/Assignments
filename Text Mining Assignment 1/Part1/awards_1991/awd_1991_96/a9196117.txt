Abstract    :
                      Research will be done on the theory of elementary particles,           
              and related areas of cosmology and astrophysics.                               
                      One focus of the work in particle theory will be the theory            
              of strings, in which the point particles of conventional particle              
              theories are replaced by extended objects having the form of tiny              
              strings.  The research in cosmology may include such topics as                 
              the cosmological origin of the baryon number, and that in astro-               
              physics such topics as the study of interaction of the magnetic                
              monopoles with neutron stars.                                                  
                      The research will be carried out by a highly-distinguished             
              young theoretical physicist who is one of the new Presidential                 
              Young Investigators for 1987.
