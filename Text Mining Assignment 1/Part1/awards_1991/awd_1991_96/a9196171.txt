Abstract    :
              Nonmonotonic reasoning and logic programming are both areas of                 
              crucial and growing significance to artificial intelligence and                
              to the whole field of computer science.  Nevertheless, despite                 
              the close realtionship between the two areas, they have been                   
              developed largely independently of each other.  However, the                   
              recent discovery of the equivalence between the perfect model                  
              semantic of logic programs and natural forms of all four major                 
              formalizations of nonmonotonic reasoning establishes a closer                  
              link between the two areas and paves the way for using efficient               
              computation methods, developed for logic programming, as                       
              inference engines for nonmonotinic reasoning.  The problem of                  
              finding efficient inference mechanisms that can reason in a                    
              commonsense manner in the absence of complete information is one               
              of the major research and implementation problems in artificial                
              intelligence.  To permit the use of logic programming as such an               
              inference engine, the investigator will develop effective                      
              procedural mechanisms for efficient execution of such methods,                 
              and will implement an experimental nonmonotonic reasoning                      
              system, based on logic programming.
