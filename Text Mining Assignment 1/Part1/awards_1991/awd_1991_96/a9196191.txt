Abstract    :
                   The purpose of the proposed research is to investigate two                
              gibberellin biosynthesis mutants of Pisum sativum.  The le and na              
              mutant alleles block the biosynthesis of gibberellins, each at a               
              specific site in the gibberellin pathway.  It is proposed to                   
              quantify gibberellin levels in constituent organs of the isogenic              
              lines througout development, using capillary gas chromatography-               
              mass spectrometry.  By monitoring gibberellin levels it will be                
              possible to determine the tissue-specificity and ontogenetic                   
              specificity of these genes.                                                    
                  The significance of this research is the potential to                      
              determine how the levels of the endogenous gibberellin A1, which               
              is active in regulating internode extension, causes a dwarf pea                
              phenotype.  The findings generated by this work will lay the                   
              foundation for more molecular studies in the future and they may               
              lead to the discovery of commercially useful peas, i.e., dwarf                 
              pea with normal pod size.
