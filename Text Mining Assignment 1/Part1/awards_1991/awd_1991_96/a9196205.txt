Abstract    :
                   The first area of research involves the study of functions                
              of a Markov process and is motivated by problems in modelling the              
              dynamics of ionic channels in cell membranes.  Problems of                     
              identifiability, characterization, restoration of noisy                        
              recordings, and parameter estimation are outlined.  The second                 
              area of research has to do with the study of drug interactions                 
              and fitting response surfaces by asynergistic functions.
