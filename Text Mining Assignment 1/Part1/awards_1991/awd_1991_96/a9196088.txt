Abstract    :
                   During development of collisional orogens high pressure-low               
              temperature metamorphism commonly forms during the subduction                  
              phase, but is often obscured by post-tectonic thermal                          
              equilibration or by later deformation and mineral growth.  The                 
              metamorphic core of the Brooks range exposes regional high                     
              pressure-low temperature rocks adjacent to lower grade fold and                
              thrust belt rocks.  This project will map structures across this               
              structural/metamorphic boundary, conduct thermobarometry on                    
              collected samples and perform radiometric age determination.                   
              Results will be used to characterize the metamorphic and                       
              structural conditions during orogenesis and to determine the                   
              uplift history of these high pressure/low temperature rocks.
