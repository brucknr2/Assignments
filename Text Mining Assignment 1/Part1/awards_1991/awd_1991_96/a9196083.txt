Abstract    :
                   Research will be done on the fundamental mathematical                     
              structure and development of efficient algorithms.  Matroid                    
              theory, a branch of mathematics which is fundamental to the                    
              theory of combinatorial optimization, provides a framework for                 
              understanding many efficiently solvable problems.  Structural                  
              properties of matroids will be studied using techniques from                   
              connectivity theory.  Polyhedral theory within combinatorial                   
              optimization deals with giving alternative descriptions of                     
              polyhedra.  Research into finding linear descriptions for the                  
              polyhedra associated with variants of certain combinatorial                    
              optimization problems so that linear programming techniques can                
              be utilized will also be studied.
