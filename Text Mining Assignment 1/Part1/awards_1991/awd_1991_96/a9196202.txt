Abstract    :
                   This is a multifaceted study of a fossil fauna comprising                 
              about 200 species of marine bivalve mollusks that occupied                     
              southern Florida prior to the recent ice age and that suffered                 
              heavy extinction during the ice age.  This fauna is spectacularly              
              preserved in shell beds exposed by quarrying at Sarasota.  PI is               
              mapping the shell beds over a large area.  Using information                   
              about habitats of surviving species and the physical nature of                 
              the shell beds, PI has concluded that the beds represent a                     
              complex of barrier island (or spit) and lagoonal environments.                 
              Further work will allow testing of hypotheses as to how the                    
              unusual vertical sequence of shell beds developed.  The fauna is               
              the tropical component of a large marine fauna that occupied the               
              entire East and Gulf coasts of the U.S.  Components of the fauna               
              from northern Florida to Virginia are well studied.  Completing                
              the picture by studying the tropical component will enable me to               
              investigate geographic patterns of extinction and migration                    
              during the ice age.  To this end, PI will complete a species-                  
              level taxonomic study of the south Florida fauna, using general                
              museum collections, his own collections, and type specimens--and               
              employing morphometrics where appropriate.  The precise age                    
              traditionally assigned to the fauna has recently been questioned.              
              PI will attempt to resolve the issue using radiometric dating of               
              fossil corals and biostratigraphy based on mollusks and                        
              microfossils.
