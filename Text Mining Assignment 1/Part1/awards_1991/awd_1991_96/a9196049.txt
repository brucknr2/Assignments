Abstract    :
              The study of glacially reworked sediments and microfossils is                  
              essential toward reconstructing the geologic and glacial history               
              of Antarctica.  Evidence from reworked Pliocene marine diatoms                 
              and fossil wood in the Sirius Group of glacial-sediments,                      
              throughout the Transantarctic Mountains, indicate a massive early              
              Pliocene destruction of the late Pliocene antarctic ice sheet,                 
              marine flooding of interior basins and polar warmth through the                
              Pliocene.  The chief objectives of this project are to                         
              substantiate the suggested Pliocene deglaciation and to improve                
              the resolution of Pliocene diatom biostratigraphy in antarctic                 
              interior basins, which will help date the reworked assemblages.                
              The improved Pliocene diatom chronology will aid in determining                
              the timing and magnitude of late Neogene ice-volume change and                 
              marine transgression; events which have implications for                       
              climatic, geologic, oceanographic and evolutionary biogeographic               
              studies within and beyond Antarctica and the Southern Ocean.
