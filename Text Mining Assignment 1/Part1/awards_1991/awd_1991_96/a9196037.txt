Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will be studying a certain class               
              of cellular automata known as cyclic cellular automata.  These                 
              are deterministic models which have qualitative similarities with              
              their stochastic counterpart in interacting particle systems.                  
              The later arise as models of interest to physicists and                        
              biologists.  One novel aspect of this study is its experimental                
              use of the computer to suggest appropriate questions for further               
              study and understanding.
