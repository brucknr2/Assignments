Abstract    :
                      Professor John Harer plans to continue computing the                   
              homology of the moduli spaces and related spaces.  He also                     
              intends to pursue further the connections between the Arbarello                
              flag (and related flags) for a certain space of moduli and the                 
              Schubert cells of the Grassmannians of Hilbert space.                          
                      This project brings together important objects from                    
              classical analysis, the moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces of                   
              genus g, with important objects from topology, n.dimensional                   
              manifolds and various associated groups.  Results obtained can                 
              therefore be expected to interest a wide audience of                           
              mathematicians.
