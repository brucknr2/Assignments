Abstract    :
                   This research utilizes three different, but complementary,                
              approaches to extend the understanding of standardization                      
              processes and outcomes: theoretical modelling, case studies, and               
              cross-sectional data analysis. The theoretical projects are: (1)               
              An examination of the effect of translator devices or "gateway"                
              technologies on standardization. This work examines the extent to              
              which translators can ameliorate inefficiencies in the                         
              standardization process, as well as whether translators might give             
              rise to new problems. (2) An analysis of the efficiency of the                 
              timing of de facto standardization by the "market".  (3) An                    
              investigation of conflict resolution and information sharing                   
              within voluntary standards committees. The case studies will focus             
              on the role of dominant firms in standard setting, the role of                 
              committees in conflict resolution versus coordination, and the                 
              timing of adoption.  Five case studies are undertaken, mostly                  
              drawn from the information processing industries. The econometric              
              projects include the measurement of benefits arising from the                  
              dramatic standardization of railroad gauges in the U.S. in 1885,               
              and the measurement of network externalities for VCR's by                      
              collecting data on adoption rates in small U.S. towns.***
