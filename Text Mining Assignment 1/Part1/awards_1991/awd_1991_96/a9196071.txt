Abstract    :
                   F. Thomas Farrell, in collaboration with L. E. Jones (of                  
              S.U.N.Y. at Stony Brook), hopes to make surgery theory a reasonable            
              method for calculating the homotopy-topological structure set of a             
              compact manifold M provided its fundamental group is a matrix                  
              group and the dimension of M is greater than 4.  (Stronger                     
              constraints on the fundamental group may be necessary; e.g., that              
              it is torsion-free and is an arithmetic subgroup of a semi-simple              
              algebraic group defined over the rationals.)  A second (and                    
              related) problem is to make Waldhausen's work the basis of a                   
              reasonable method for calculating.
