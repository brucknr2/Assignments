Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The principal investigator will analyze conformal metrics on              
              compact Riemannian manifolds which either have or do not have                  
              boundaries.  The existence of positive solutions to semilinear                 
              elliptic equations with non-linear boundary conditions will also               
              be investigated.  Additionally, topological obstructions to the                
              existence of metrics with positive curvature on compact manifolds              
              with boundary will be studied in detail.                                       
                   The sphere is the only two-dimensional compact surface which              
              can have positive curvature everywhere; that is, at each point                 
              there are two distinct directions in which the surface bends                   
              "down."  Points on a saddle have negative curvature for the                    
              saddle bends down in one direction, but up in other directions.                
              Tori, or surfaces of donuts, cannot have positive curvature                    
              everywhere, regardless of how they are deformed.  The principal                
              investigator will study the analogous question for higher-                     
              dimensional compact hypersurfaces.
