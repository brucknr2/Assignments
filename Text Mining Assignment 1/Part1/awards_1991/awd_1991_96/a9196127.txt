Abstract    :
              This project studies determinants of entry into and exit from                  
              family-related adult roles, including marital and premarital                   
              child birth, marriage, separation, and cohabitation.  It goes                  
              beyond previous methodology by distinguishing between deter-                   
              minants of the timing of events and determinants of the                        
              lifetime probability of the events.  Previous methods cannot                   
              distinguish timing and probability, so, for                                    
              example, they cannot tell whether a higher divorce rate means                  
              members in the population are generally more likely to experience              
              divorce, or whether they just experience it earlier than                       
              members of some other population.  The PI has developed new                    
              methods and models to see, for example, whether certain risk                   
              factors associated with high divorce rates cause higher probabil-              
              ities or accelerate the timing of divorce for those couples who                
              will eventually divorce.   Software developed for this project                 
              will be available for use by other investigators using similar                 
              large data sets.
