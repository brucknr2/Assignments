Abstract    :
              This work involves the investigation of the adhesive                           
              characteristic of two principal fouling organisms, namely,                     
              Enteromorpha intestinalis and Ectocarpus spp. that adhere                      
              to underwater ocean vessels and structures, the resulting                      
              formation on the surfaces and the consequent changes in                        
              hydrodynamic forces.  The study therefore will take shape                      
              in three phases.  The first is to establish the time                           
              varying adhesion of the organisms as a function of surface                     
              and environmental conditions, including factors that                           
              influence adhesion.  Secondly, to develop a model of the                       
              fouled surface as a function of time, surface and                              
              environmental conditions.  And finally, the work includes                      
              the use of the modeled surface to analytically formulate a                     
              method to better predict changes in hydrodynamic forces                        
              caused by fouling.
