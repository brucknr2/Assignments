Abstract    :
                   By means of a law of large numbers and central limit                      
              theorem, the author wishes to compare stochastic and                           
              deterministic models of a chemical reaction with diffusion.  The               
              proposed methods will exploit the smoothing properties of the                  
              relevant contraction semigroup more fully than previous work and               
              reflect underlying large deviation behavior.  The methods                      
              developed can be used for proving regularity results for                       
              stochastic evolution equations having a discontinuous and non                  
              Gaussian martingale term.  The stochastic model is to be                       
              reformulated as a measure valued diffusion.                                    
                   This investigator works in the field of probability, in the               
              area of stochastic processes.  He is working on models of                      
              chemical reactions which have been actively investigated by other              
              researchers for the last 15 years.  His results will not only                  
              significantly aid in the understanding of these reactions but                  
              will also contribute to the set of tools mathematicians employ in              
              attacking certain problems.
