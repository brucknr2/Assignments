Abstract    :
              This proposal is to develop methods for controlling a                          
              device that extends human mechanical ability.  The                             
              "extender" is a sleeve that fits over the arm of an                            
              individual, and that can be controlled by weak voluntary                       
              movements.  The "extender" provides amplification so that                      
              the weak signals may be used to control a powerful                             
              orthosis.  The thrust of the proposal is to build a                            
              computer-driven mechanical simulator for developing                            
              algorithms for controlling the device in spite of wide                         
              variations of the characteristics of the human arm.                            
              Realistic measurement will be used to derive input-output                      
              relationship for the human arm; these measurements will                        
              then be used as reproducible representations of the                            
              living system for exploring different control algorithms.                      
              If successful, the research will have application in                           
              restoring function to some individuals with movement                           
              disorders (including partial paralysis), and in the                            
              design of human-controlled robots.
