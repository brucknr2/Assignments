Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The combustion of model chlorinated hydrocarbon compounds is                   
              being studied in a flat flame burner and flow reactor in an                    
              effort to develop detailed chemical kinetic mechanisms.                        
              Stable intermediate species profiles within chloro-benzene and                 
              chloro-toluene/methane flames are measured using gas                           
              chromatography and mass spectrometry; laser photolysis is                      
              utilized to generate chloromethyl and chlorovinyl radicals in                  
              the flow reactor, with an on-line mass spectromer used to                      
              measure the products of decomposition/reaction in the presence                 
              of oxygen.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              The research will lead to the establishment of a better                        
              understanding of the combustion of chlorinated hydrocarbons,                   
              expressed in the form of a detailed chemical kinetic                           
              mechanism.  The mechanism can be used as a rational starting                   
              point for understanding the role chlorine plays in the                         
              formation of pollutants such as chlorinated aromatics, di-                     
              benzo furans, and di-benzo dioxins in incinerators.
