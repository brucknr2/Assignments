Abstract    :
                   Frohman intends to study problems relating to the geometry                
              and topology of three-dimensional manifolds.  His research is                  
              developing  along two lines.  The first aims to finish the                     
              uniqueness part of the topological classification of minimal                   
              surfaces in R3.  The second will continue studying                             
              representations of the fundamental groups of knots from a                      
              geometric perspective.
