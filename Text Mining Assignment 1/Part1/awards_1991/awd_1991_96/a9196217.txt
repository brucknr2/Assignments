Abstract    :
                   Nutrient limitations appear to be widespread in the                       
              oligotrophic rainforest ecosystems of the Rio Negro portion of                 
              the Amazon basin.  This research will test several hypotheses                  
              regarding carbon-nutrient relations and nutrient-use efficiency                
              for these forests.  Four discrete primary forest communities                   
              (each on different soil type) will be studied, along with a                    
              successional community.  Species overlap between these                         
              communities is minimal, even though all five communities are                   
              located within 1 km from each other at San Carlos de Rio Negro,                
              Venezuela.  Individuals from 5 species in each community (25                   
              species total) have been monitored for six years, providing                    
              baseline data on leaf production and leaf duration.  Now nutrient              
              and carbon relations will be studied with respect to leaf                      
              longevity and leaf aging and soil nutrient availability.  The                  
              main hypotheses are that distinct differences will emerge among                
              communities (and species):  1) in leaf morphology and nutrient                 
              content, as a result of variation in habitat resource                          
              availability and species successional niche, 2) in CO2                         
              assimilation capacity, as function of leaf nutrient content and                
              photosynthetic nitrogen- and phosphorus-use efficiency, 3) in                  
              long-term carbon gain and nutrient-use efficiency, as a result of              
              variation in photosynthetic nutrient-use efficiency, leaf                      
              longevity, and leaf nutrient retention and retranslocation over                
              time.
