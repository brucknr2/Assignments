Abstract    :
              Dr. Lybrand will be developing and applying computer modeling                  
              techniques to the study of ligand-biomolecule interactions.                    
              The project is multidisciplinary in nature, drawing on                         
              computational techniques from theoretical chemistry and                        
              interactive computer graphics modeling methodology from                        
              computer science, coupled with basic science components of                     
              biochemistry and pharmacology.                                                 
                                                                                             
              Collaborative efforts will be made with specialists in                         
              complementary fields such as computer science and theoretical                  
              chemistry.  This will greatly enhance the research in                          
              computer simulation by drawing from state-of-the-art                           
              methodologies and resources in various disciplines.
