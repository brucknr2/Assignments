Abstract    :
                   The proposed work will develop algorithms for motion                      
              planning of three-dimensional manipulators operating amidst                    
              unknown obstacles of arbitrary shape.  The robot arms considered               
              here are assumed to have a contact-sensitive sensory skin such as              
              nearly all animals possess. (Such arms are being developed in a                
              parallel project at Yale.)  Prior studies of the two-dimensional               
              case produced fast algorithms guaranteed to converge to a global               
              position goal.  This work will extend the simulation and                       
              mathematical analyses to three-dimensional arms of increasing                  
              complexity.
