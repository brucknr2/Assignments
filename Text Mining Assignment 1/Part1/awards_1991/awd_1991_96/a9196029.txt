Abstract    :
                   This is a proposal to connect NSFNET to JANET, its closest                
              equivalent in the U.K., via 56,000 bit per second AT&T satellite               
              service.  The proposed link is not in any sense experimental; it               
              is intended to operate in full production mode for the exchange                
              of routine scholarly traffic between the academic computer                     
              networks of the U.S. and the U.K.  The only existing link                      
              supporting the Internet standard TCP/IP protocols is DARPA-MOD                 
              SATNET which places stringent restrictions on non-defense related              
              traffic.                                                                       
                   The proposal provides for the U.S. share of the satellite                 
              link itself and an IP router/gateway to be installed at the John               
              von Neumann National Supercomputer Center, the U.S. terminus.                  
              Funds are also included to operate and maintain the gateway and                
              associated services such as routing tables and a secondary domain              
              nameserver.
