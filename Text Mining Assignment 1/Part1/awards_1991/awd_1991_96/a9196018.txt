Abstract    :
                   The proposed research involves a multidisciplinary approach               
              to the study of Aptian-Albian black shales:  1)  Refinement of                 
              Aptian-Albian stratigraphy with development of an integrated                   
              higher resolution foraminiferal and calcareous nannofossil                     
              biostratigraphy is proposed, and 2) detailed sedimentologic and                
              geochemical (organic; stable isotopic) studies of Aptian-Albian                
              "black shale" sequences in order to document the stratigraphic                 
              sequence of anoxic vs. oxic conditions and resulting changes in                
              type and/or preservation of organic matter.  Our study will                    
              involve intensive investigation of selected land and DSDP/ODP                  
              sequences of Aptian-Albian age from a broad spread of                          
              paleolatitudes and paleoenvironments.  The objectives are:  1) to              
              improve the understanding of and better constrain models for the               
              origin of organic carbon-rich strata of mid-Cretaceous age, which              
              are a major portion of the hydrocarbon source best of the world;               
              2) to investigate the forcing of black shale deposition by                     
              tectonic, paleoceanographic, eustatic and climatic events; and 3)              
              to understand the relationships between biotic evolution and                   
              formation of sedimentary (e.g. Mn) ore deposits to OAEs and OASEs.
