Abstract    :
                      Picosecond and femtosecond laser pulses will be used to study          
              ultrafast optical and electronic processes in semiconductors.  Three           
              projects will be supported by the PYI program.                                 
                      Nucleation processes and superheating of Si after illumination         
              with a ps high power laser pulse will be studied by time-resolved              
              spectroscopy techniques.                                                       
                      Hot carrier relaxation in the extended states, carrier trapping        
              across the mobility edge and thermalization in the bandtail states will        
              be investigated by femtosecond spectroscopy in a-Si:H and related              
              alloys. Picosecond electrical pulses will be produced using the Auston         
              switch technology.  The transient response of III-V semiconductor              
              superlattices to these pulses will be investigated theoretically.              
              Emphasis will be put on the variations of the optical properties.
