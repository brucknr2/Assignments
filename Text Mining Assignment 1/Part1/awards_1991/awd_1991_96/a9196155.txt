              Pego                                                                           
                   The main goal of this project is to develop a mathematical                
              understanding of nonlinear dynamics appropriate for models of                  
              continua which admit phase transitions.  The mathematical                      
              problems to be studied address the general questions:  How do                  
              nonlinear systems relax to equilibrium?  How do interfaces and                 
              transition zones propagate?  Specifically, the project includes                
              the study of the propagation of transition layers in the                       
              Cahn-Hilliard equation and phase field equations, to prove the                 
              validity of interface migration laws via the geometric approach                
              to singular perturbations; the formal determination of the laws                
              of migration for singularities in nematic liquid crystals using                
              a regularized model of Lin and the geometric method; the                       
              discovery of admissibility criteria for shock waves in                         
              compressible fluids which account for metastability and                        
              homogeneous nucleation, nonequilibrium phenomena which have                    
              recently been shown to be highly relevant in experiment.
