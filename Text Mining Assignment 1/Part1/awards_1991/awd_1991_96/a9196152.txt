Abstract    :
              This research pursues three topics in parallel computation.  The first         
              is the relationship between special-purpose and general-purpose                
              systems.  Specifically, the identification of "useful" primitives to be        
              implemented by a fixed interconnection and the emulation of one                
              interconnection by another.  The second area is the study of strategies        
              for problem partitioning, since fixed-size interconnections will be            
              used to solve variable-size problems.  The last area is the study of           
              matching algorithms and architectures in particular for applications           
              such as computational geometry and computer vision.
