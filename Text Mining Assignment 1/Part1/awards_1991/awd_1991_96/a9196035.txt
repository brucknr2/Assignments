Abstract    :
              Observations in 1987-1989 of Eurasian Arctic sea ice with                      
              high sediment content raise questions of consequences for                      
              ice melting, ice modeling, and paleoenvironmental                              
              reconstructions.  During 1990 and 1991 it is proposed to                       
              investigate sediment transport by sea ice by identifying the                   
              sources of the sediment, examining the development of                          
              sediment-laden floes and assessing the climatic impact of                      
              sediment inclusions in sea ice.                                                
                                                                                             
              The sediment sources will be identified by comparing                           
              existing sediment samples from western Eurasian Arctic sea                     
              ice floes to analyses of sea floor sediment from the                           
              Siberian Seas.  Sediment incorporation by river discharge                      
              during spring breakup, and aeolian transport by costal dust                    
              storms will be assessed based on LANDSAT imagery of the                        
              Siberian shelf seas.  In addition, the history and                             
              development of sediment-laden multi-year floes will be                         
              deciphered.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              The potential climatic impact of sediment-laden sea ice                        
              within the context of varying environmental scenarios will                     
              be estimated using a coupled energy balance climatic-sea ice                   
              model, which incorporates a modified version of the                            
              parameterization of the effect of "dirty" inclusions on snow                   
              and ice albedo used in Ledley and Thompson (1986).
