Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              The primary objective of this U.S.-Czechoslovak research project               
              between Dr. Josef Michl of the University of Texas, Austin, and Dr.            
              Stanislav Hermanek of the Institute of Inorganic Chemistry, Rez, is            
              to explore several aspects of the phyiscal inorganic chemistry of              
              boranes.  Upper electronic state spectroscopy will be employed to              
              examine a large number of closo, nido and arachno boranes.                     
              Additionally, calculations of excited state energies and                       
              wavefunctions, vibrational information, and results from studies of            
              matrix-isolated reactive intermediates will be drawn upon to                   
              characterize boranes.  Through study of boranes chemistry the                  
              researchers expect to determine principles of behavior for electron            
              defuicient molecules and to create an order, similar to that                   
              already available for electron-satisfied elements derived through              
              study of the chemistry of carbon.                                              
                                                                                             
              This project in inorganic chemistry fulfills the program objective             
              of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in               
              the United States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary                  
              talents and pool research resources in areas of strong mutual                  
              interest and competence.
