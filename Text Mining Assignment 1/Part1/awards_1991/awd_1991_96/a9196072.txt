Abstract    :
              In the data processing industry, an acute                                      
              competition exists for devising novel schemes for                              
              obtaining greater storage densities while at the                               
              same time realizing rapid file access rates and                                
              reliable data retrieval.  The major goal of the                                
              proposed research is to develop an optical                                     
              imaging system based on correlator-based spatial                               
              filtering concepts for parallel processing of the                              
              read-back data in optical magnetooptical data                                  
              storage devices to realize high data rates and                                 
              improved Signal-to-Noise (SNR) ratio.  The                                     
              analytical development of the processing system                                
              by employing the newly developed Synthetic                                     
              Discriminant Function concept will be                                          
              conducted.  An appropriate coding scheme for                                   
              its implementation will be developed and a                                     
              laboratory demonstration of the performance                                    
              characteristics of the processing system will be                               
              conducted.
