Abstract    :
              A currently working prototype system will be extended to develop               
              a computerized view of metabolic reactions that includes viewpoints            
              onto metabolic reactions that are difficult or impossible to                   
              achieve with existing textbook or wall-chart representations.  The             
              system will include the ability to search enzymatic reactions by               
              chemical groups, provide lists of all potential inhibitory sites               
              of a compound, and graphically output any desired segment of known             
              biochemical pathways.  The system will provide varied access paths             
              to information about metabolism by removing artificial limits to               
              thinking imposed by fixed printed implementations currently                    
              available.  The system is expected to serve the needs of a wide                
              variety of researchers interested in biochemical pathways, as well             
              as providing an educational tool for students at every level of                
              expertise.
