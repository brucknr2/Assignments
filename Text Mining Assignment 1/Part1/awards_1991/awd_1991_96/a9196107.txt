Abstract    :
              A central focus for research in science studies is the relationship            
              between experts and society.  This study will analyze the influence            
              of social science experts in encouraging democratic participation              
              in the formation and implementation of public policy.  To explore              
              this topic, secondary, archival, and oral history data will be                 
              examined in a qualitative historical study of social scientists                
              employed in developing precursors to the U.S. "War on Poverty"                 
              Community Action Programs.  Alternative theories will be considered            
              in an analysis of the degree and nature of the impact of political             
              and other social forces on the activity of social science experts.             
              These theories will also be used to analyze conflicts in work roles            
              and assumptions of the social scientists in shifting from a                    
              "scientific" to a "professional reformer" model of expertise.  This            
              shift occurred during this period.  Other research questions focus             
              on the social scientists' conceptualization of community                       
              participation, the persons served by their actions, and the impact             
              those actions had.  The results of this study will expand our                  
              understanding of both the potential and limitations of the use of              
              social science experts in the promotion of citizen participation               
              in community reform initiatives.  Results will include a book                  
              manuscript and articles in refereed journals and other                         
              publications.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              This research has an important and timely focus; its results will              
              be useful and accessible to a wide audience.  The qualifications               
              and track record of the investigator are excellent; institutional              
              support is very good; the research plan is sensible.  Support is               
              highly recommended.
