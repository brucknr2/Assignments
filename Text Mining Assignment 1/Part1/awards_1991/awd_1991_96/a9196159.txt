Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will implement a dual-channel chopping photometer for               
              use on the completely renovated 0.76-m Keeler reflector at                     
              Allegheny Observatory.  A dual-channel chopping photometer is                  
              ideally suited to the observatory's needs because the primary                  
              interest is in colors in their photometry program.  Furthermore,               
              observations of stellar colors are insensitive to the conditions               
              of non-photometric weather, which is common at Allegheny                       
              Observatory.  According to record books at Allegheny Observatory,              
              there are an average of 120 nights per year which are suitable                 
              for dual-channel chopping photometry.                                          
                                                                                             
              Some astrometric target stars are variable; their light curves                 
              will be observed so that a search for any type of correlations                 
              between magnitude and astrometric position can be made.                        
              Photometric observations of stars in new astrometric regions will              
              provide the astrometric program with an efficient method for                   
              choosing appropriate reference stars.
