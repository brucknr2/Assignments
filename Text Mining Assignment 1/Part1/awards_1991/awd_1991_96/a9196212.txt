Abstract    :
              This project continues and extends current studies of quantum                  
              strongly-interacting collective phenomena associated with (i) the              
              (mainly fractional) quantum Hall effect (QHE) and (ii) strongly-               
              quantum magnetism (mainly antiferromagnetism).  Surprising                     
              theoretical connections between these apparently physically very               
              different strong-interaction phenomena have emerged, and will be               
              more fully explored by this project.  Novel types of off-diagonal              
              long-range order will be emphasized, as will the possible                      
              application to superconducting oxides.  Goals of the project                   
              include:  (i) a more fundamental classification of incompressible              
              fractional QHE states, (ii) the study of fractional QHE states                 
              involving spin-reversal, and (iii) the development of the non-                 
              linear field theory of quantum antiferromagnetism, taking into                 
              account order-parameter topology and qualitative differences                   
              between integer and half-integer spin systmes.  Possible novel                 
              "chiral" states (i.e., states with broken reflection and time-                 
              reversal symmetry) of 2D quantum spin systems will also be                     
              investigated.
