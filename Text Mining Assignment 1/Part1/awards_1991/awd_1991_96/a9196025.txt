Abstract    :
                   This is a project  to carry out trace element and isotopic                
              analyses on samples from the East Pacific Rise at 9 16' to 9                 
              40' N and 13 30' to 15 N that have been obtained by dredging on              
              a fine scale. The objectives are to investigate trace element and              
              isotopic heterogeneity among lavas from a single magma chamber,                
              to study nature of ridge segmentation and its controls on fine                 
              scale geochemistry, examine temporal variability and test                      
              hypothesis the local Pb-Pb correlations are isochrons recording                
              the age of local mantle heterogeneity.                                         
              %%%                                                                            
                   One of the most interesting results of geochemical                        
              measurements on rocks dredged from the sea floor in recent years               
              has been fine scale variations of composition along the axis of                
              mid-ocean ridges where the rocks are formed.  These compositional              
              variations appear to be related to tectonic segmentation of the                
              ocean ridge axes themselves, but the details are not well                      
              understood.  This project, being carried out by an established                 
              geochemist (White) and a bright young geochemist (Castillo), who               
              was engaged in the initial collection on the sample set, on a                  
              suite of rocks from an area where much geophysical data exists,                
              should yield significant insight into the relationship between                 
              tectonic and magmatic segmentation of ridge crests.
