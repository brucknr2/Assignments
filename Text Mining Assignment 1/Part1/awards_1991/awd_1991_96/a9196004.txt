Abstract    :
              This research by a Presidential Young Investigator is focused                  
              on mixing, turbulence, instabilities, and coherent vortex                      
              structures in fluid flows.  The principal tool will be                         
              computational fluid dynamics (CFD), so that the research also                  
              contains a strong component towards developing accurate and                    
              efficient computational techniques and computer architectures.                 
                                                                                             
              Better and faster methods in CFD will permit the prediction of                 
              more complex flows, heretofore not simulated but accessible                    
              only to experiments.
