Abstract    :
              The proposal seeks to explore the properties of "Agar Powder" to               
              develop a technique for high quality undisturbed sampling of                   
              cohesionless soils, both above and below the ground water table.               
              Undisturbed sampling of cohesionless soils is a critical issue in              
              geotechnical engineering, and the development of a superior                    
              technique would benefit both research efforts and design practice              
              for static and dynamic loading of these soils.
