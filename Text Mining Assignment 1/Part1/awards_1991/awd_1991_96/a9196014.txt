Abstract    :
              This investigation will explore the evolutionary consequences of               
              variable recruitment in a colonial hydroid.  Work to date has                  
              demonstrated that: 1) recruitment density varies among isolated                
              populations and determines the intensity of intraspecific                      
              competition;  2) colonies display genetically based variation in               
              colony morphology that determines intraspecific competitive                    
              ability; and 3) the morphologies present in population are                     
              correlated with the observed level of competition.  These                      
              preliminary data suggest that recruitment density establishes the              
              selective regime that determines the suite of morphological                    
              characters present in a population.  This hypothesis will be                   
              tested by experimentally manipulating recruitment density in four              
              populations and while following three other populations as                     
              controls.  This research will contribute to our knowledge of                   
              marine populations by examining the potential for variation in                 
              recruitment density to generate evolutionary change in species                 
              with limited gene flow among populations.
