Abstract    :
                   The Proterozoic of Arizona is part of a 1300 km wide                      
              orogenic belt that is primarily made up of juvenile (1800-1600                 
              ma) additions to the continental crust.  Work to date indicates                
              that up to eight separate tectonic blocks having different                     
              structural, metamorphic, geochronologic and geochemical                        
              characteristics exist.  The goal of this collaborative project is              
              to understand the mechanisms for the accretion, assembly and                   
              stabilization of the new crust, and subsequent post-orogenic                   
              uplift of the Proterozoic crust.  The work will involve mapping,               
              PTt determinations  and U-Pb dating off metamorphic minerals, and              
              will be performed by workers at Northern Arizona University                    
              (EAR89-16373), University of Massachusetts (EAR89-16494), and                  
              Washington University (EAR89-16247).  Results are expected to                  
              help understand how ancient juvenile continental crust formed and              
              was incorporated into stable areas of continents.
