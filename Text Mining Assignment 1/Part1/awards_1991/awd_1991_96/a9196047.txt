                   This project is concerned with some problems in                           
              statistical mechanics.  The basic aim of statistical mechanics                 
              is to obtain the large scale thermodynamic behavior of a many                  
              particle system from a knowledge of the microscopic interaction                
              between the particles.  The thermodynamic behavior is described                
              as a function of a few parameters such as temperature and                      
              destiny.                                                                       
                   The principal investigator will study a classical gas with                
              short range interaction at high temperature.  He plans to show                 
              that at a sufficiently high temperature there is no phase                      
              transition.  The main task is to study the high density system                 
              and show that it is approximately gaussian.                                    
                   He will also study ground state energies of systems with                  
              long range Coulomb interaction.  These systems are particularly                
              important since the electromagnetic Coulomb force is ubiquitous                
              in nature.  For a system of charged Bosons in a jellium                        
              background, he wants to show that the thermodynamic limit of                   
              the ground state energy per particle is, at high densities,                    
              given precisely by a formula of Foldy.  This would show that                   
              the Bogoliubov ansatz, which is widely used in heuristic                       
              theories of superfluidity and superconductivity, is valid in a                 
              certain case.
