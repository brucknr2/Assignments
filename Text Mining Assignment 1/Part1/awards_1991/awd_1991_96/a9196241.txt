Abstract    :
              This research will investigate the mechanism of wetting induced                
              collapse in unsaturated soils. Certain soils stable in the dry or              
              partially dry state, collapse when sufficient water is added. A                
              better understanding of this phenomenon could allow better                     
              prediction of the stability and settlement performance of                      
              embankments and foundations.
