Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This grant is a renewal award for DMR-8521834, which was                  
              highly productive: development of new analytical techniques to                 
              study the fundamental phase transformations and chemical                       
              reactions between two different oxide ceramics at near atomic                  
              resolution, development of the use of Rutherford backscattering                
              spectroscopy to determine the kinetics of reactions in these                   
              systems, and confirmation that topotaxial and epitaxial growth in              
              these materials occurs in layers of several unit cells at a time               
              rather than one atomic layer at a time, as previously believed.                
              The emphasis of this work is to use these new analytical                       
              techniques to understand the effect of the structure and                       
              chemistry at the phase boundary upon the movement of the                       
              interface between two oxides of different crystal structure.                   
              Analytical techniques being used include:  all aspects of                      
              transmission electron microscopy will be used (e.g., chemical                  
              analysis, atomic lattice imaging. converging beam electron                     
              diffraction), electron microprobe, visible light microscopy,                   
              Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy, and x-ray diffraction.                 
              Materials if interest include:  nickel-aluminum oxide spinels,                 
              magnesium-aluminum oxide spinels, magnesium-chromium-aluminum                  
              oxide speinels, and iron-aluminum oxide spinels.  The research                 
              has two main objectives:  geometry of the interface, and to                    
              understand how the morphology and the chemistry of the interface               
              affect the kinetics with which the interface develops.
