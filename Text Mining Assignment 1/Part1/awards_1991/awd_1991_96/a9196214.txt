Abstract    :
              With this grant in the Theoretical and Computational Program of                
              the Chemistry Division, Professor George will perform                          
              theoretical studies of the elementary excitations of atoms and                 
              molecules coupled to a host matrix, which is either a solid or                 
              a cluster. This work is  critical in understanding the                         
              important experimental data gathered in this area.                             
                                                                                             
              A formal theory will be developed to describe the dynamics of                  
              molecular exciplexes coupled to elementary excitations of a                    
              solid matrix; i.e., quasiparticles such as phonons. This theory                
              will incorporate electron-phonon interactions and the effects                  
              of spontaneous emission between phonon-shifted electronic                      
              states. A semiempirical approach called the                                    
              diatomics-in-ionic-systems (DIIS) method will be used to study                 
              the structure of neutral and positively charged rare gas                       
              clusters containing hydrogen and/or halogen species. Special                   
              attention will be given to the case of argon cluster. This                     
              study will  also involve the calculation of excited as well as                 
              the ground electronic states.
