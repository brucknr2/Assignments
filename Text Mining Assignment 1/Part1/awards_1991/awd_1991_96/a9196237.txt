Abstract    :
                   Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) processes in the surface layers of              
              the sun are of great interest because, first, these phenomena are              
              largely responsible for solar activity; second, they challenge                 
              our theoretical understanding of the basic physics underlying                  
              these processes; and third, predictions of theoretical                         
              calculations can be subjected to direct observational test. This               
              work focusses on a study of overstable modes in the surface                    
              layers of the sun; including (1) the excitation of acoustic waves              
              in the solar convection zone and photosphere, (2) the                          
              concentration of solar acoustic oscillation power in certain                   
              temporal and spatial ranges, and (3) the excitation of MHD waves               
              in thermally and gravitationally stratified photospheric magnetic              
              flux tubes (such as sunspots).  The work involves both analytical              
              studies and numerical simulations.  ***
