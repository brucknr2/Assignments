Abstract    :
              The research described in this proposal will significantly                     
              enhance our understanding of the ways in which gender differences              
              in wages develop over time, with particular attention here to the              
              onset of this process. A relatively new and comparatively rich                 
              data set with characteristics not elsewhere available (the 1979                
              youth cohort from the National Longitudinal Survey), combined                  
              with additional information about the organization and industry                
              in which the respondent works, will be processed and analyzed.                 
              Rather than study individuals at one point in time or individuals              
              at repeated and regular intervals, this research will focus on                 
              the actual duration of an employee's tenure with each of                       
              their employers and will study the relative influence of a                     
              variety of factors on the change in wages that occurs during that              
              tenure. Among the factors to be studied that are not typically                 
              considered are firm-specific tenure, a theoretically crucial                   
              variable in the context of human capital and transaction                       
              theoretical perspectives, the gender mix specific to the                       
              occupation and industry category associated with an                            
              employer, and other firm or industry characteristics such as the               
              extent of unionization or the degree of product-market dominance               
              associated with the employer. Alternative theoretical                          
              expectations about the sources of gender gaps in wages will be                 
              compared with the statistical results.
