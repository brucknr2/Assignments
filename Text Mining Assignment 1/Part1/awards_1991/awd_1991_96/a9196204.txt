Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will continue his research in Gauge            
              theory and explore a set of equations known as the Vortex                      
              equations. These equations are defined for holomorphic bundles over            
              Kahler manifolds and are closely related to the Hermitian-Yang-                
              Mills equations. The principal investigator will study three areas             
              of Gauge theory in this project: Yang-Mills type functionals, the              
              moduli spaces associated with gauge invariant functionals, and                 
              properties of holomorphic vector bundles.                                      
                   Gauge theory is a branch of geometry very closely connected               
              with mathematical physics. It is an area in which ideas from                   
              physics are serving to develop and enrich geometry and techniques              
              of mathematics and geometry are used to explore ideas in physics.              
              A number of different methods, some very analytic and others                   
              algebraic, are successfully being used to create a powerful and                
              beautiful theory in physics. It is one of the exciting examples of             
              cross disciplinary research being done in mathematics today.
