Abstract    :
                   This award to the University of Kentucky's Department of                  
              Geological Sciences is made in response to a proposal                          
              submitted to the National Science Foundation's Instrumentation                 
              and Laboratory Improvement Program. The award will provide                     
              one-half of the funds needed to acquire microcomputers, software,              
              TV monitors, overhead projection and digitizing tablets, and a                 
              printer. The University is committed to matching the NSF                       
              contribution for this equipment.                                               
                   The equipment will be used in the University's undergraduate              
              sophomore-level course in mineralogy, where it will be developed               
              for use in laboratory computerized instruction in crystal                      
              chemistry, crystal morphology, atomic structure, mineral                       
              identification, x-ray diffraction methods, optical microscopy and              
              phase equilibrium studies.
