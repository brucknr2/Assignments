Abstract    :
              The objectives of this project are as follows:                                  
                                                                                            
              (l)  To design a graphical event description language and environment          
              to support development of abstract models for the different layers of          
              a message-passing program's communication structure.                           
                                                                                             
              (2)  To develop a debugging tool that compares a communication model           
              defined in the above graphical language to the run-time communication          
              structure of a program.                                                        
                                                                                             
              (3)  To study the effectiveness of the graphical event description             
              language and the debugging technique.                                          
                                                                                             
              The debugging tool provides the user with a mechanism for directing a          
              debugging session based on the user's mental abstractions of a                 
              program's communication structure.  Additionally, the communication            
              model can be designed for any level of the program and thus allows the         
              user to debug the program in a top-down fashion. By providing one              
              general graphical format for describing the model and for displaying           
              the run-time behavior, users are given a common visual interface for           
              both the input and output of the debugger based on their own                   
              abstractions.
