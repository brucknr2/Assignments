Abstract    :
              A study will be made of the physics of solid surfaces and                      
              interfaces which possess unique bonding configurations and                     
              electronic properties.  A combination of surface sensitive                     
              techniques, including photoemission, inverse photoemission and                 
              optical properties will be used to probe the kinetics of                       
              interface formation, the nature of bonding between different                   
              materials and the atomic and electronic structure of interfaces                
              between semiconductors, metals and insulators.  A novel                        
              photothermal displacement spectroscopy will be employed to obtain              
              information not accessible with electron spectroscopies.  This                 
              work is of importance for the microelectronics industry.
