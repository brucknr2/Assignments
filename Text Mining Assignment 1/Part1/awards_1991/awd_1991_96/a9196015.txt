Abstract    :
              This project is directed at developing and implementing algorithms for         
              decomposing polyhedra into simpler parts, the result of which is called        
              a partition.  The use of three different algorithmic paradigms is being        
              examined:  space sweep, divide-and-conquer, and incremental refinement.        
              In the last paradigm, a sequence of increasingly refined partitions is         
              constructed, in which each partition is based upon its predecessor.            
              Each of the paradigms relies upon being able to query one or more              
              current partitions.  These queries are supported by the use of a novel         
              data structure, known as the facet-edge data structure, which previous         
              research suggests is well suited to algorithms for decomposing                 
              polyhedra.  Implementation of each new algorithm will demonstrate its          
              practicality.
