Abstract    :
              Professor Libchaber will investigate various aspects of nonlinear              
              phenomena through highly controlled experiments.  Turbulent heat               
              flow will be studied using the model system of liquid 4He at                   
              temperatures of 5 Kelvin.  Heat flow will be investigated in                   
              liquid mercury and these studies will be aimed at increased                    
              understanding of the onset of chaos in this type of flow.  A                   
              third experiment will be continued study of the motion of the                  
              interfaces between two different phases of matter, especially to               
              determine the interface motion and pattern formation and the                   
              stability of the motion.
