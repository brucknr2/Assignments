Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Two newly developed models, based on culturing experiments                
              with planktonic foraminifera, make it possible to: a)                          
              differentiate physiological from environmental influences on the               
              13c and 18o of foraminiferal calcite and b) extract new                        
              paleoenvironmental information about seasonal changes in water                 
              temperature and the 13c of seawater total CO2 from fossil                      
              foraminifera. The Euphotic Zone model uses the carbon isotope                  
              record in conjunction with 18o signal to reconstruct seasonal                  
              temperature ranges in surface waters and at the base of                        
              paleoceanic euphotic zones. The Quantitative Carbon isotopemodel               
              provides a technique for filtering out "vital effects" inthe 13C               
              record to reconstruct the 13C of environmental CO2.                            
                                                                                             
                   The objective of the research is to expand the application                
              of the EZ and QC models to new planktonic foranimiferal species                
              through culturing and physiological experiments with living                    
              froaminifers.                                                                  
                                                                                             
                   The new paleoceanographic information about surface ocean                 
              insight into effects of transient and long-term changes in the                 
              euphotic zone on paleoclimatic change.
