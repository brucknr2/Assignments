Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The goal of this research project is to better understand how to               
              efficiently use the present generation of parallel computers and to            
              influence the design of the next generation.  The bulk of the research         
              will be in the design of processor efficient parallel algorithms for           
              abstract machines that possess a  message passing architecture such as         
              the Parallel Random Access Machine.  The problems under investigation          
              include the breadth first search of an undirected graph.  Special              
              attention will be given to architectures where the individual                  
              processors contain a relatively large amount of local memory.  Message         
              passing schemes which efficiently simulate the local memory model will         
              be considered.
