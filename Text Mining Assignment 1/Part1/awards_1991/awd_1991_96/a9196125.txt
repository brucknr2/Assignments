Abstract    :
              A combined experimental/numerical simulation approach will be                  
              applied to study the onset of chaotic mixing phenomena in                      
              strongly viscous flows where ordinarily turbulence will not                    
              occur.  This phenomenon is known as chaotic advection, and a                   
              number of cases have been studied in two-dimensional                           
              geometries with time-varying forcing of the flow.  The present                 
              research is to conduct experiments and perform numerical                       
              simulations in three-dimensional geometries.                                   
                                                                                             
              The cases to be considered are a novel helical annular mixer                   
              and a partitioned pipe mixer in which the fluid is                             
              periodically reoriented as it flows down the pipe.
