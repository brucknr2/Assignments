Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              The primary objective of this U.S.-Czechoslovakia cooperative                  
              research project between Dr. Daniel Szyld of Duke University and               
              Dr. Ivo Marek of Charles University is to analyze the mathematical             
              properties of pseudo-irreducible operators and pseudo-primitive                
              operators and to study their relevance to solutions for singular               
              linear systems.  In particular, methods for computation of stationary          
              distributions of Markov processes will be examined.  The researchers           
              hope that their collaborative study of properties of pseudo-primitive          
              and pseudo-irreducible operators will yield proof of a theorem                 
              similar to "THEOREM A.  An operator is convergent and irreducible              
              if and only if it is primitive."                                               
                                                                                             
              This project in applied mathematics fulfills the program objective             
              of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in               
              the United States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary                  
              talents and pool research resources in areas of strong mutual                  
              interest and competence.
