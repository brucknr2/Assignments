Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The P.I. is developing this project in response to two                         
              unrelated events:  1) recent NSF research initiatives regarding                
              human dimensions of global environmental change, and 2) an                     
              invitation from the Hungarian Academy of Sciences to                           
              participate in a forthcoming international conference that will                
              examine the relationship between linguistic diversity and                      
              various social problems.  The P.I.'s paper in Budapest,                        
              September 1989 will examine parallels between socialinguistic                  
              diversity and literacy as they correspond to the social                        
              stratification of health care in the U.S., Puerto Rico, and                    
              Mexico.  The P.I. plans to extend this research to the domain                  
              of environmental change.  The nature of this research requires                 
              that the P.I. travel for consultation.  The P.I., therefore,                   
              requests travel funds along with funds to pay research                         
              assistants and to purchase some equipment.
