Abstract    :
              This award provides funds for a PYI award to an outstanding young              
              scientist interested in the development of non-invasive methods for            
              image analysis of complex materials including human tissues.   Dr.             
              Mcfarland has had a broad training in nuclear engineering, medical             
              engineering and medicine.  In this proposal, he will focus on the              
              use of NMR for the image analysis, in particular, the analysis of              
              images that reflect biochemical reaction kinetics.  The planned                
              research will make substantial and important contributions to the              
              field of non-destructive imaging of biological and non-biological              
              materials.
