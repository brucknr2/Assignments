Abstract    :
                   This research is at the interface between probability and                 
              statistics.  The principal investigator will study the limit                   
              behavior of quadratic forms under long-range dependence.  She will             
              also consider trimmed sums in the case of long-range independence.             
                   The assumptions made in performing a statistical analysis                 
              typically include the independence or weak dependence of the                   
              observations.  This is not always realistic.  This research is                 
              concerned with the study of data exhibiting long-range dependence.
