Abstract    :
              This fellowship award will support study of the Japanese language              
              by an American scientist or engineer by providing a stipend,                   
              tuition, and other course-related expenses.  The objectives of the             
              fellowships are to enable active U.S. scientists and engineers to              
              acquire sufficient familiarity with the language and customs of                
              Japan to allow them to function independently there; or to acquire             
              sufficient expertise in reading Japanese to be able to understand              
              technical abstracts in their field of interest.                                
                                                                                             
              There is a critical need for more effective technical communication            
              between American and Japanese researchers.  This award is intended             
              to help remove language and cultural barriers to U.S.-Japanese                 
              cooperative  research and to facilitate science and technology                 
              exchange.
