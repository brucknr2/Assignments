Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Funds are provided to support the investigator's ongoing                       
              efforts to study the response of planktonic foraminifera to                    
              oceanic upwelling. This study area is strongly influenced by                   
              seasonal and interannual variations in the strength of the                     
              California Current, resulting in pronounced periods of Ekman-                  
              induced upwelling.  The study will result in an (1) increased                  
              understanding of the ecology of planktonic foraminifera which                  
              live in a highly unstable but productive seasonal upwelling                    
              habitat; (2) documentation of the seasonal succession and                      
              assemblage composition of these species: (3)  identification of                
              species that respond to periods of upwelling and/or                            
              phytoplankton bloom conditions; (4) identification of upwelling                
              signals recorded in the stable isotopic composition of                         
              foraminiferal tests; (5) an composition of foraminiferal                       
              seasonal abundance/distribution patterns and isotopic                          
              composition to sedimentary assemblages in both bioturbated and                 
              non-bioturbated sediments.
