Abstract    :
              The purpose of this award is to continue support for development               
              of a user-friendly data base of stock market transactions.                     
              Considerable progress has been made to date in developing the                  
              data base for the New York and American Stock Exchanges, and two               
              months of data has been made available at 16 test sites.  This                 
              data base includes transaction prices for all security trades,                 
              not just closing trades.  Transactions prices will be maintained               
              for the most recent ten years of data.  This award will allow the              
              investigator to complete the work on the New York and American                 
              Stock Exchange transactions and will provide for the development               
              of a similar data base for Over-The-Counter trades and quotes.                 
              These data will be made readily accessible, in a convenient                    
              format, and at a reasonable cost to scholars doing research in                 
              the area of financial economics.  At present, information is not               
              readily available to academic researchers.  This project is                    
              important because it will allow scholars to explore a host of                  
              questions regarding the functions of financial markets which at                
              present is not possible, given the high cost and access problems               
              associated with existing data sets.
