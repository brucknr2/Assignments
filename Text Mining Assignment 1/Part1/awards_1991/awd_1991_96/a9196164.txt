Abstract    :
              This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the work                 
              of Dr. Joseph J. Grabowski at Harvard University.  The results                 
              of this investigation will provide new insights into the                       
              fundamental details of the processes by which chemical                         
              reactions take place.                                                          
                                                                                             
              Dr. Grabowski will employ the Flowing Afterglow and Selected                   
              Ion Flow Tube techniques to examine, probe, and define                         
              mechanisms of gas-phase, organic, ion-molecule reactions.                      
              Competitive reactions will be employed so that accurate product                
              ratios will provide direct information about the alternative                   
              reaction channels in the absence of solvent effects.  Both                     
              positive-ion and negative-ion systems will be studied, and the                 
              investigation will focus on comparisons of such reaction pairs                 
              as elimination-substitution, competitive H-atom transfers, and                 
              reactions at differently hybridized carbon centers in the same                 
              molecule.
