Abstract    :
              This award in the Joint NSF/DARPA Initiative on Image                          
              Understanding and Speech Recognition is for an interdisciplinary               
              study of computer vision in navigational reasoning.                            
              Computational and psychological approaches to spatial cognition                
              will be combined to model expert map interpretation and                        
              perception of large-scale environments.  The investigators will                
              also develop representations and algorithms for navigational                   
              problem solving, with special attention to the role of vision in               
              map-based navigation.  Much of the work will be integrated with                
              research projects by industrial collaborators.
