Abstract    :
              The importance of efficient sorting algorithms is widely acknowledged          
              in many applications.  This project is an investigation of the problem         
              of producing fast n-input parallel sorting circuits.  The model used is        
              the popular sorting network.  For extremely small n, the fastest               
              sorting networks are hand-constructed.  For intermediate n, the fastest        
              networks are essentially those of Batcher.  For extremely large n, the         
              fastest sorting networks are those of Ajtai, Kimlos and Szemeredi.             
              Improvements in all three situations are sought.                               
                                                                                             
              For very small n, a modification of existing backtracking algorithms           
              should result in viable networks with a slightly larger number of              
              inputs.  For intermediate n, Batcher's sorting algorithm will be               
              modified to use larger building blocks.  This approach is essentially a        
              careful analysis of the divide-and-conquer strategy.  For very large n,        
              existing algorithms will be studied for potential improvements.
