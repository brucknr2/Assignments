Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Investigations in Mathematics:  Alternatives to Traditional Assessment         
              will develop assessment techniques and tools that help teachers and            
              eighth grade students focus on students' understanding of and ability to       
              communicate about essential mathematical ideas in a wide range of              
              realistic and imaginative situations.  The Lawrence Hall of Science will       
              assemble a group of mathematicians, mathematics educators, and                 
              mathematics teachers to create a collection of tools, called                   
              "investigations", and a process for using them which integrates                
              assessment and instruction.  In each investigation, students will be           
              required to read, understand, conceptualize, and represent a problem           
              situation; to use mathematical skills and knowledge to make sense of the       
              situation; and to communicate their thinking in a form that can be             
              understood and evaluated.  Investigations will give students the               
              opportunity to consolidate and apply their mathematical understandings         
              to the solution of complex problems.  Included in the package will be          
              teaching suggestions for the introduction of investigations, ways to           
              assist students as they work on investigations, sample scoring schemes,        
              and ideas for giving students feedback on their work.  The                     
              investigations will focus on the most important mathematical ideas of          
              the curriculum.
