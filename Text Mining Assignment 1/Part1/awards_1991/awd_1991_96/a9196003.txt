Abstract    :
              The purpose of this research is to enable econometric and economic             
              models to better represent economic behavior and, thus, provide better         
              answers to questions confronting decision makers in the private and            
              public sectors.  The project will involve the reformulation of problems        
              in statistical inference and optimization, inspired and made possible          
              by recent advances in widely available computational capacity.                 
              Research methods iterate between the problems that define and motivate         
              economic analysis and econometrics, computational experiments, and the         
              development of new analytical tools.  In economic modeling, the                
              emphasis is on numerical mapping from decision rules to objective              
              functions.  Much of this development is in the context of particular           
              problems, including seasonal adjustment, nonstructural representations         
              of macroeconomic time series, cointegration models, the solution of            
              nonlinear or rational expectations models that are generic and                 
              algorithmic, and can, therefore, be used systematically in studying a          
              wide range of problems.  This and related research by others over the          
              next decade will enable economists to address policy problems much more        
              directly, with emphasis shifting from the constraints of analytical            
              approaches to a greatly enriched modeling of behavior.
