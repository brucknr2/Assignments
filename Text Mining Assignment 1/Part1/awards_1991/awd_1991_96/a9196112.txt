Abstract    :
                   The interaction of the solar wind with ionized gas confined               
              by the earth's magnetic field results in a long extension                      
              downwind, to a distance of hundreds of earth diameters, of the                 
              magnetic field and gas (the magnetosphere) and the generation of               
              currents of millions of amperes.  These currents (Birkeland, or                
              field aligned currents) link the solar wind - magnetosphere                    
              boundary region (about 60,000 km above the surface), with the                  
              highly conducting ionosphere (about 100 km above the surface),                 
              and create the striking displays of light emission known as the                
              aurora.  They also disturb the ionosphere, and cause interference              
              with radio transmissions and military radar communications.  This              
              award is for a study aimed at improving our understanding of the               
              electric fields associated with the generation of the current                  
              systems, using the scientific radar at Sondestrom Greenland, and               
              a chain of magnetometers.
