Abstract    :
              This award supports one aspect of the second Greenland Ice Sheet               
              Project (GISP II).  The GISP core from Summit, Greenland, will                 
              produce very old ice and paleoclimatic information with excellent              
              time resolution, due to the prevailing accumulation rate and mean              
              annual temperature.  This effort will establish in this core a                 
              high resolution CO2 record, which is necessary to ultimately                   
              understand the natural disturbance in the carbon cycle, and the                
              relationship and interaction between CO2 and climate.  This                    
              record, when compared to temperature records (and                              
              particulate/chemistry/cosmogenic isotope records) will yield                   
              information on the cause/effect relationship of CO2 and climate,               
              and on the mechanisms to produce atmospheric CO2 variations over               
              different time scales.  If the rapid variations in the last                    
              glacial could be confirmed, important information would be                     
              obtained on the climatic sequence of the anthropogenic alterations             
              to the earth's trace gas involving in recent times.
