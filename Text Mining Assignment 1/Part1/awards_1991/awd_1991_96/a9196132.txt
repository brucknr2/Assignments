              Abstract                                                                        
                  This proposed work seeks to develop a flare model which                   
              self-consistently incorporates the quasi-static fields, currents,              
              and wave-particle interactions important in determining the                    
              particle dynamics.  The model will be based on earlier work which              
              has investigated some of the characteristics of microwave and                  
              soft and hard X-ray emissions.  The model will be able to make                 
              predictions on basic flare processes, including the necessary                  
              conditions for flare onset (e.g. magnetic field configuration),                
              the flare current system and the evolution of flare emissions at               
              a variety of wavelengths, including microwaves and X-rays.  These              
              predictions will be tested against observations, allowing more                 
              detailed analysis of the observations and better insight into the              
              underlying physics. ***
