Abstract    :
              The scope of the recently discovered gem-dimethylation reaction                
              based on the Tebbe reagent will be explored.  The reaction                     
              provides a one step route to the important gem-dimethyl                        
              substructure by the direct conversion of a carbonyl group.  The                
              substructure is found in many important natural and synthetic                  
              products.  The work will seek to provide an understanding of                   
              the structure, or structures, of the actual active species                     
              generated from the titanium-based reagent.  The studies will                   
              explore the preparation of analogous reagents and will probe                   
              the mechanistic pathways for these species.  The synthetic                     
              scope of the reaction with different types of carbonyl groups                  
              will also be explored.

              With this Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) award,                  
              the Organic Synthesis Program is supporting the research of Dr.                
              Stanley H. Pine of the Department of Chemistry at California                   
              State, Los Angeles, University.  Dr. Pine's work focuses on a                  
              new synthetic reaction based on a bimetallic organometallic                    
              compound containing titanium and aluminum.  The reagent will                   
              accomplish, in one step, the transformation of a carbonyl group                
              into a group that contains a carbon bound to two methyl groups,                
              a process that now requires two or more synthetic steps.  The                  
              development of the reagent will increase the ease and                          
              directness of the synthesis of a number of terpenoid natural                   
              products.  The program will also involve undergraduates in a                   
              meaningful way.
