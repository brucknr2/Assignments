Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will be used to construct a surface analytical system               
              capable of measuring surface vibrations and phonons of materials               
              with sub-meV energy resolution, as a function of momentum, over a              
              temperature range from 20 Kelvins to 800 Kelvins.  Simultaneous                
              characterization of electronic and structural properties of                    
              surfaces will be possible.  The fundamental properties of surface              
              phonons for simple metals, semiconductor, insulators, and thin                 
              films will be investigated as well as the vibrational modes of                 
              surface defects and adsorbates.  The improved resolution and signal            
              will allow detailed phonon dispersion curves to be obtained for                
              various surface structures.  The surface phonon spectra will be                
              correlated with the geometrical structure using Low Energy Electron            
              Diffraction, Scanning Tunneling Microscopy, X-ray and Ion                      
              scattering, and with the electronic structures using XPS, AES, and             
              Angle-resolved photoemission.  Close coupling of experimental                  
              results to theoretical calculations of the lattice dynamics will be            
              carried out.  This instrument will be the first one of it's kind in            
              the United States.
