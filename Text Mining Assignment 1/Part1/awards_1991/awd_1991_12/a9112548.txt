Abstract    :
                   This Summer Mathematics Institute is a six-week residential               
              research summer school for about 25 minority undergraduates from               
              the United States and Puerto Rico.  The participants will have                 
              completed at least two years of collegiate mathematics with                    
              distinction by Summer 1991. Each student will participate in two               
              intensive seminars which have been designed to allow the student to            
              explore a mathematical subject in depth and to experience the                  
              excitement of creating mathematics.  A principal common to all                 
              seminars is helping students to develop increased fluency with                 
              mathematical language, both written and oral.  The overall goal of             
              the Institute is to help the students make the important transition            
              from learning mathematics to doing mathematics.                                
                   The Institute will be held on the Berkeley campus and                     
              continues and builds on successful Institutes held in 1989 and                 
              1990.  These Institutes are an integral part of a comprehensive                
              national strategy aimed at eliminating the under-representation of             
              minorities in mathematics and mathematics-dependent professions.
