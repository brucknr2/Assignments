Abstract    :
                   The fish order Characiformes comprises the most important                 
              group of freshwater fishes living in Africa and in Central and                 
              South America. They have been studied extensively because of their             
              economic importance as food and as aquarium resources (for example,            
              the "tetras"), and because of their remarkable adaptations to                  
              numerous kinds of aquatic environments, including the infamous                 
              predatory habits of the piranhas. However, the evolutionary                    
              relationships among the major families of characiform fishes are               
              poorly understood, and morphological characters alone promise                  
              little help in resolving the matter.                                           
                   Faculty advisor Axel Meyer will assist graduate student                   
              Guillermo Orti in an extensive molecular systematic survey of                  
              mitochondrial DNA variation in representative samples of the major             
              characiform groups. The amount and kind of mutational differences              
              in mitochondrial DNA between fish species indicate relative degree             
              of genealogical relationship, and thus provide data to infer the               
              phylogeny of these lineages. Insight into the evolutionary history             
              of this species-rich group of fishes will in turn help in                      
              understanding the geographical diversification between African and             
              South American faunas following the geological breakup of Gondwana.
