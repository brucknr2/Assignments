Abstract    :
              Dr. Thomas Phillips, in conjunction with ten major users,                      
              proposes to set up a resource center for immunocytochemistry and               
              in situ hybridization technologies at the University of                        
              Missouri.  The center would include, and funds are requested for,              
              a confocal fluorescence microscope, a computer graphics system                 
              for three-dimensional reconstruction of confocal microscope                    
              images, a low-light microscope and camera for fluorescence                     
              studies, and an associated image processing system for ration                  
              imaging of indicator dyes to determine cellular pH or ion                      
              concentrations.  The center will incorporate some already                      
              existing equipment: a transmission electron microscope,                        
              microtomes and a cryostat.  This facility would complement                     
              existing campus-wide cores for monoclonal antibody production and              
              oligonucleotide synthesis.  Various units within the University                
              will provide 50% of the capital costs, long-term salary support                
              for staff, substantial existing equipment, and funding for                     
              laboratory renovation and continuing service contracts.
