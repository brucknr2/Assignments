Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program                 
              will help the Department of Chemistry at the University of                     
              North Carolina at Chapel Hill acquire an Electron Paramagnetic                 
              Resonance (EPR) spectrometer with variable temperature                         
              capability.  The EPR will be used to perform both                              
              low-temperature, steady-state experiments and new time-resolved                
              experiments in diverse media such as in thin polymer films, on                 
              the surfaces of metal and semiconductor electrodes, and in                     
              liquid solution over a wide temperature range.

              Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy is a technique for                
              studying molecules possessing unpaired electrons.  For such                    
              molecules two or more different energy states arise when a                     
              magnetic field is applied, and transitions among the different                 
              occurs upon absorption of quanta of radiation in the microwave                 
              region.  When an unpaired electron comes in the vicinity of a                  
              nucleus with a spin, an interaction takes place which causes                   
              the absorption signal to be spilt into several components.                     
              From this interaction molecular structure can be inferred.  EPR                
              spectroscopy is also used in studies of the rates of reactions                 
              and in studies involving radical intermediates produced in a                   
              reaction.
