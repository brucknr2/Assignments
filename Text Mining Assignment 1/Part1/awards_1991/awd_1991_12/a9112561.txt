Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Many theories have been put forward to account for the collapse                
              of the Maya civilization approximately 1,000 years ago.  Some                  
              hypothesized that continuously shifting political forces led to                
              instability and ecological disruption.  Through the analysis of                
              skeletal material, this research proposes to test implications of              
              the politico-ecological hypothesis.                                            
                                                                                             
              Chemical analysis of skeletal remains can yield information on                 
              dietary factors through the characterization of carbon and                     
              nitrogen isotopes.  Dietary inadequacies and general state of                  
              health also marks the remains through the appearance of                        
              paleopathological indicators.  Demographics can be estimated                   
              through the determination of age at death and sex from skeletal                
              remains.  The hypothesis makes specific predictions as to the                  
              diet,health and demography of the Maya just prior to the                       
              collapse.  The research allows these predictions to be tested.
