Abstract    :
              Partial funding is provided to support purchase of a contour                   
              profilometer and a surface measuring instrument system capable of              
              computer interfacing.  The equipment will be utilized in a number              
              of projects on surface finishing, friction modeling, surface                   
              degradation and tribology in general.
