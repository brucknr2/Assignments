Abstract    :
                   The transmission electron microscopy will be used to elucidate            
              the atomic-scale damage produced in naturally-occurring apatite an             
              zircon by induced fission of substituent U-235.  Objectives of the             
              research are to characterize the general structure of unannealed               
              latent fission tracks in apatite, to obtain lattice-fringe images              
              within and adjacent to fission tracks in apatite, and to                       
              characterize the general structure of unannealed latent tracks in              
              zircon.  Crystals to be examined in this study are zircon and                  
              Durango apatite (a near end-member fluorapatite).  Observations on             
              the apatite will require a cold-stage maintained at liquid nitrogen            
              temperatures in order to minimize beam damage to the crystals and              
              prevent thermal annealing of the fission tracks.  Observations on              
              both minerals will be made under varying experimental conditions               
              (e.g., different electron microscopes using various detector                   
              systems and collection methods, and different voltages, modes of               
              imaging, crystal orientations. etc.).
