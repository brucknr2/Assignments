Abstract    :
                   An integral component of the multi-agency U.S. Global Change              
              Research Program (Our Changing Planet," Committee on Earth                     
              Sciences, 1991) is understanding and modeling the geospace                     
              environment.  As part of its contribution to the U.S. Global                   
              Change  Research Program, the National Science Foundation's                    
              Division of Atmospheric Sciences has established a new research                
              initiative,  Geospace Environment Modeling (GEM), with the goal                
              of supporting basic research into the dynamical and structural                 
              properties of geospace, leading to the construction of a global                
              geospace model with predictive capability.                                     
                   The subjects of the first GEM campaign are the                            
              magnetospheric boundary, the magnetosheath beyond it, and the                  
              connection from the boundary through the magnetosphere to the                  
              ionosphere.  The magnetopause is the boundary between the shocked              
              solar wind plasma in the magnetosheath and magnetospheric plasma.              
              Magnetic reconnection and anomalous transport at the magnetopause              
              are key  mechanisms for the transport of solar wind plasma into                
              the magnetosphere, whose understanding is a priority of the                    
              Geospace Environment Modeling (GEM) Program.                                   
                   The goal of this grant is to develop a model of turbulence                
              fluctuations and transport in the magnetopause current layer                   
              which can be coupled with simulations of collisionless                         
              reconnection and compared with observations.
