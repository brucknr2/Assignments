Abstract    :
              This grant is for support of a conference to be held                           
              (March 4-6, 1991).  The Optical Computing Topical                              
              Meeting will consist of invited papers and both oral                           
              and poster contributed papers in the areas of                                  
              research in materials, devices, architectures and                              
              algorithms relevant to optical computing.
