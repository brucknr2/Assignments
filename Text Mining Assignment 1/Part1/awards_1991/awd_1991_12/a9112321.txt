Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A US-USSR workshop on photosynthesis will be held in the                       
              Soviet Union during August 1991.  The USSR Academy of                          
              Sciences' team is lead by Academician Igor A. Tarchevsky,                      
              Director, Kazan Institute of Biology; Professor V.I.                           
              Kefeli, Director, Institute of Soil Science and                                
              Photosynthesis, Pushchino; and Academician A.A.                                
              Krasnovsky, A. N. Bakh Institute of Biochemistry.                              
                                                                                             
              The American delegation will consist of 10 senior and 10                       
              junior scientists.  This proposal covers primarily the                         
              funding of the junior scientists (Ph.D. granted within                         
              past ten years.)                                                               
                                                                                             
              The topics covered in the workshop will include the                            
              biophysical, biochemical, physiological and ecological                         
              aspects of photosynthesis.  Attention will also be given                       
              to the processes affecting crop productivity.                                  
                                                                                             
              This project fulfills the program objective of advancing                       
              scientific knowledge by enabling leading researchers in                        
              the US and the USSR to combine complementary efforts and                       
              capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest and                            
              competence in the field of basic scientific research on                        
              the basis of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of                           
              benefit.
