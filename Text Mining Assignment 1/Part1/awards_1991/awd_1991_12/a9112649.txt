Abstract    :
              This research evaluates image motion analysis using a model-                   
              fitting estimator developed by the Principal Investigator.  This               
              estimator, which fits the unknown likelihood function with a                   
              function selected from a multi-scale family of model likelihood                
              functions, is claimed to be highly robust, less dependent on                   
              initial guesses, and resistant to data confusion in multi-object               
              tracking.  The method has so far been tested with simulated data;              
              tests would be expanded to real data from both laboratory and                  
              outdoor scenes, including mixed modalities with range and visual               
              images.
