Abstract    :
                   This work in mathematical physics deals with the relation                 
              between causal descriptions of dynamical systems and the time-                 
              scales of the underlying dynamics.  This will be studied using                 
              simple mathematical models that are area preserving maps and                   
              their quantised versions (multidimensional extension of                        
              Baker's Map, BBGKY hierarchy).  The work relates to the                        
              general problem of chaos and its correspondence in quantum                     
              mechanics.
