Abstract    :
              This is a request for a Fourier                                                
              Transform Infrared Spectrometer to                                             
              be used by several investigators in                                            
              the area of biomaterials.  The                                                 
              equipment will facilitate research                                             
              on material surfaces and new                                                   
              coatings: such research is                                                     
              essential for developing new                                                   
              materials that are suitable as                                                 
              biomedical implants.  Since the                                                
              investigators have good                                                        
              accomplishments in biomaterials                                                
              research, it is expected that this                                             
              equipment will further enhance                                                 
              their productivity.
