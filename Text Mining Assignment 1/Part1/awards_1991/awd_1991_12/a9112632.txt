Abstract    :
              Additional equipment to supplement the existing scanning                       
              tunnelling microscope (STM) facilities at Notre Dame is                        
              acquired.  The new instruments are an atomic force microscope                  
              (AFM) and a STM designed for operation under ultrahigh vacuum                  
              (UHV) conditions.  Both instruments will use the existing                      
              control/analysis system.                                                       
                                                                                             
              The instruments will be used to correlate catalytic activity                   
              with structural and morphological features such as size and                    
              crystal phases in model supported catalysts and platinum                       
              single crystals.  The new instruments will permit the                          
              observation of structure and morphology at atomic scale.
