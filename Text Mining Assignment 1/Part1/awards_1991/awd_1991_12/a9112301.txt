Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Very recent advances in computer technology provide the power of               
              mainframe systems in relatively compact and inexpensive personal               
              computers.  Over the next decade this tremendous computing power               
              will become available in high schools throughout the country.  We              
              propose to harness this new technological resource as a teaching               
              tool for specific topics in math and science, focusing on random               
              processes in nature and their deep connection to concepts in                   
              probability and fractal geometry.  Such natural phenomena as the               
              growth of snowflakes via random aggregation and the disordered                 
              geometric configurations of polymer chains demonstrate that                    
              fundamentally random microscopic processes can give rise to                    
              predictable macroscopic behaviors.  They also give rise to random              
              fractal structures of inherent interest and great beauty.                      
              Because it is impossible to view the underlying processes                      
              directly computer simulation and visualization is an                           
              indispensable tool for understanding and studying these                        
              phenomena.  In the process of "doing science" with both hands-on               
              experiments and computer simulations, students will learn                      
              abstract mathematical concepts in a context which is at once                   
              concrete and inherently motivating.  Furthermore, the techniques               
              they will employ will mirror in most respects those in current                 
              use by researchers, thus forging an unprecedented link between                 
              this curriculum and the professional worlds of science and                     
              mathematics.
