Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award is for the purchase of an ion miller, capable of                    
              chemically-assisted ion-beam etching, to be used for the                       
              preparation of materials for Transmission Electron Microscopy                  
              (TEM).  This ion miller is dedicated to research projects in                   
              materials engineering including:  the surface control of atomic                
              diffusion in III-V semiconductors; rapid solidification of                     
              ceramics; ion mixing of semiconductor layered structures; interface            
              characterization of epitaxially grown superlattices; chemical                  
              synthesis of oxides; and guided wave optical devices and materials             
              at the 1.3 micron wavelengths.
