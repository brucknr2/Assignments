Abstract    :
                 Increased attention to human-induced environmental change has               
              highlighted the need to understand more completely the nature and rate         
              of responses of critical systems to changing environmental conditions.         
              Among the relationships for which greater knowledge is needed are              
              responses of hydrologic systems to changes in the land uses within             
              drainage basins.  This project will analyze the dynamics of watershed          
              response to during the last century in southwestern Georgia, where rapid       
              deforestation occurred in the mid- to late-1800s, leading to a deep,           
              intricate system of gullies and canyons.  In recent decades, however,          
              logging and agricultural activity in the area have diminished                  
              substantially, causing less dramatic but nonetheless significant changes       
              in runoff regimes.  Fieldwork in the area will provide information for         
              more accurate dating of land-use disturbances and fluvial responses.           
              Sediment samples of valley fill and terrace sequences will be dated            
              through dendrochronologic and aerial photographic analyses.  Land-use          
              changes will be identified using tax records and aerial photos.  Data          
              from these investigations will be related to topographic and climatic          
              data using a modified hydrologic model.                                        
                 This project will contribute to both theoretical and empirical              
              understandings of the conditions that promote fluvial geomorphic               
              instability.  It also will contribute to new knowledge about the lag           
              times of response and recovery when watershed characteristics change           
              through human activity.
