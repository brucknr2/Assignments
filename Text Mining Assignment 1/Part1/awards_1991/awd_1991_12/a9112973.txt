Abstract    :
              The research team will investigate                                             
              the fabrication and performance of                                             
              circularly-symmetric-grating,                                                  
              surface-emitting (CSGSE)                                                       
              semiconductor lasers.  The objective                                           
              of the research is the development                                             
              and demonstration of an AlGaAs-GaAs                                            
              semiconductor laser that emits a                                               
              beam with a circular cross-section.                                            
              Such a laser has the potential to                                              
              improve the efficiency with which                                              
              light can be coupled into an optical                                           
              fiber, to reduce the divergence of                                             
              the emitted beam, and to serve as                                              
              the basic element in a two-                                                    
              dimensional phase-locked array.                                                
              Circular grating will be fabricated                                            
              in AlGaAs-GaAs semiconductor laser                                             
              structures, grown my molecular beam                                            
              epitaxy, using electron-beam writing                                           
              and chemically-assisted ion-beam                                               
              etching.  Quantum-well laser                                                   
              structures grown on misoriented GaAs                                           
              substrates will be used to obtain                                              
              the highest quality material and the                                           
              lowest threshold current density                                               
              possible, and to minimize the                                                  
              possibility of filamentary lasing.                                             
              The circular grating will operate to                                           
              produce oscillating laser modes in                                             
              the waveguide that are radially

              waves.  The use of a second-order                                              
              grating will allow a circularly-                                               
              symmetric beam to be coupled out of                                            
              the laser through the surface.  The

              evaluation of the laser will be                                                
              accompanied and guided by
