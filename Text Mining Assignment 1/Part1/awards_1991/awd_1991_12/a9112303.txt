              Edison-related documents.  One of the most prolific and influential            
              inventors in history, Thomas Edison was at the center of majro                 
              social and technical changes that shaped the twentieth century.                
              He left five million pages of correspondence, lab notes, and                   
              related business records that provide significant insights into his            
              diverse technical creativity, his relationships with technial and              
              financial communities, and his world-wide entrepreneurship--                   
              insights that should inform current and future scholarship,                    
              education, public discourse, and public policy.
