Abstract    :
              On-line algorithms work with only partial information about the input          
              data.  At each time step, such an algorithm receives one unit of data,         
              and has to produce partial results before seeing the remaining data.           
              This project will focus on on-line competitive algorithms, which are           
              algorithms that return a solution that is not worse than a constant            
              times the optimal one.  In the k-server problem, an on-line sequence           
              of requests must each be met by one of k servers which move around in          
              a metric space.  The cost of a server algorithm is defined to be the           
              total movement of the servers.  General methods for solving on-line            
              problems will be formulated in terms of on-line games.  The techniques         
              developed in this work should find applications in other on-line               
              problems.
