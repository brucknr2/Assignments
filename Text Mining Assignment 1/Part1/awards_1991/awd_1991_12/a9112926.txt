Abstract    :
              Professor Horia Metiu is supported by a grant from the                         
              Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to perform                     
              theoretical simulations of silicon growth on surfaces and time                 
              dependent quantum theoretical treatments of the effects of                     
              ultrashort laser pulses on molecular solutes.  In the first                    
              area of research, Metiu will use correlation function theory to                
              calculate the rates of all the elementary kinetic steps                        
              involved in the epitaxial growth process: the sticking of atoms                
              to the surface, their jumps from one surface site to another,                  
              the dependence of the jumping rate on local configuration of                   
              adsorbed atoms, and the final sites involved in the jump.                      
              These rates will be used in a kinetic Monte Carlo program to                   
              simulate the kinetics of epitaxial growth of silicon.  In the                  
              second area of research, Metiu will develop methods capable of                 
              analyzing the results of novel experiments with ultrashort                     
              pulses which are used to probe the dynamics of solute                          
              molecules.  He will also explore the theoretical consequences                  
              of coherence and interference in generating laser signals that                 
              are very sensitive to the quantum dynamics.

              This research will provide an important molecular level                        
              understanding of epitaxial growth on semiconductor surfaces and                
              of techniques for laser control of chemical processes in                       
              solution.
