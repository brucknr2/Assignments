Abstract    :
              Dr. Cittadino is continuing his study of the development of the                
              science of ecology between World Wars I and II.  His project                   
              entails a thorough investigation into the history of ecological                
              science during the 1920s and 1930s from an international                       
              perspective and with an effort to interrelate intellectual,                    
              cultural, social, and institutional themes.  The investigation                 
              includes examination of primary and secondary sources and travel               
              to a number of important archives.  The period between the wars                
              witnessed the intellectual and institutional maturation of ecology,            
              the emergence of methodologies and concepts usually associated with            
              the postwar period, the emergence of methodologies and concepts                
              usually associated with the postwar period, the emergence of                   
              identifiable schools, and the initial encounters between this new              
              science and a variety of social and ideological views and                      
              practices.  This study promises a substantial contribution to the              
              historical understanding of ecological science, still more or less             
              in its infancy, and offers a unique perspective of a multi-                    
              dimensional study carried out from an international point of view.
