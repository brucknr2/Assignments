Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemical Engineering at Michigan State                       
              University will purchase a high-speed video Kodak Ektapro 1000                 
              and a long-distance microscope (Infinity Photo-Optical                         
              Company), which will be dedicated to support research projects                 
              in engineering.  Flow visualization techniques will be                         
              employed to study the underlying mechanisms governing the                      
              capture of small liquid drops by a reverse-flow core votex                     
              within a hydrocyclone, and to quantify the displacement and                    
              entrainment of air by viscoelastic fluids within a resin                       
              transfer molding environment.  Other ongoing research projects                 
              within the College of Engineering which will benefit by the                    
              abailability of the requested equipment include composite                      
              materials, aerodymanics, sedimentation food engineering, and                   
              biotechnology.
