Abstract    :
                   The equipment grant will provide an Environmental Scanning                
              Electron Microscope (ESEM) for conducting in-situ dynamic studies              
              on a range of manufacturing processes, materials engineering and               
              tribological problems.  This revolutionary equipment allows samples            
              to be examined, or in-situ phenomenon recorded, under dynamic                  
              conditions in different environments (gaseous or liquid at chamber             
              pressures from 0.1 to 50 torr and at different temperatures up to              
              1000C.  The large specimen chamber (12" x 12" x 12") can                       
              accommodate a wide range of samples allowing the simulation of                 
              manufacturing processes (eg., cutting metal forming, plastics                  
              injection molding, etc.), tribological phenomena, and materials                
              testing (tension, compression torsion, fatigue, stress corrosion               
              cracking, combined loading).                                                   
                   Some of the in situ studies include hot corrosion; failure of             
              glass fibers in an epoxy-glass composite or silicon carbide fibers             
              in an aluminum matrix under a range of loading conditions; effect              
              of various cutting fluids in machining of different materials;                 
              machining of glass, ceramics, polymers, and composites; metal                  
              forming; effect of lubricants in friction and wear; solidification             
              of metals; and the mechanism of nucleation and growth of                       
              polycrystalline diamond films made by low pressure chemical vapor              
              deposition techniques.
