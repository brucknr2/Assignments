              Natural Disasters.  The committee has a                                        
              multidisciplinary membership to carry out its

              various types of disasters on engineered and                                   
              institutional systems.  Disasters                                              
              investigated by the committee include those

              implications for hazard reduction and                                          
              planning for disaster response.
