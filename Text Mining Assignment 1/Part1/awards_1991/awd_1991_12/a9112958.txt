Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Predominantly Black urban public schools have long been                   
              regarded as ghetto wastelands, seriously remiss in their capability            
              of providing more than minimal education.   This Minority Research             
              Initiation Planning Grant examines the effects on Black student                
              competitiveness in higher education and the labor market of                    
              attendance at an historically Black public high school.  A two-case            
              comparative study of an historically Black and an historically                 
              White public high school both before and after desegregation will              
              provide data to assess what factors aid and what factors impede                
              post-secondary achievement in these school settings.                           
                                                                                             
                   This project will enhance our understanding of the factors                
              contributing to long term achievement in education and the labor               
              force.  This project also provides an excellent opportunity for a              
              promising young scholar to lay the foundation for more extensive               
              research that will provide valuable information on the nature of               
              pre-college school environments.
