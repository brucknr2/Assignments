Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                   The medial preoptic area of the hypothalamus is known to                 
              exhibit sexual dimorphism in a number of mammalian systems,                    
              including humans.  Moreover, sex differences have been revealed in             
              several neurochemical systems, including the endogenous opioid                 
              peptides and their receptors.  Evidence suggests that hypothalamic             
              opioid peptides influence neuroendocrine physiology and behavior.              
              Dr. Hammer will examine the regulation of brain opioid peptide and             
              receptor systems by gonadal steroid hormones in identified neuronal            
              circuits of the hypothalamus.  Using state-of-the-art                          
              neuroanatomical and molecular biological techniques, he will                   
              describe and characterize changes in the regulation of opiate                  
              receptor expression in specific brain regions and neurons during               
              estrus.  After determining the precise localization of these                   
              receptors, which are the functional site of action for opioid                  
              peptides, he will identify the various populations of opioid                   
              neurons that project to this important hypothalamic region.  These             
              studies will provide novel information about the anatomy and                   
              steroid sensitivity of opioid hypothalamic circuits.  The results              
              will lead to a greater understanding of the basic mechanisms                   
              underlying  the control of neuroendocrine function, and how                    
              disruption of this mechanism by aberrant hormonal or narcotic                  
              action could produce reproductive or other neuroendocrine                      
              disorders.
