Abstract    :
              Labor issues concerning public school teachers represent one of                
              the most interesting and important areas of applied research in                
              labor economics.  In an era of shrinking supply of teachers, the               
              educational system is also confronted with an alarming rate of                 
              teacher turnover.  The purpose of this research is to analyze                  
              teacher compensation and mobility.   A theoretical model is                    
              developed of the hiring and retention of overlapping cohorts of                
              teacher.  By studying a bargaining model of contract determination             
              in which the preferences of the union's median voter plays a                   
              crucial role, it is possible to focus explicitly on the role of                
              unions in the bargaining process.                                              
                                                                                             
              The model will be tested using an unusual data set of public school            
              teachers in Pennsylvania.  The data includes information on 100,000            
              teachers by school district, along with information on collective              
              bargaining contracts by school district.  By including all 501                 
              districts in the state throughout the 1980's, a large and detailed             
              set of panel data has been created which provides an extraordinary             
              opportunity to examine empirically the link between mobility and               
              collective bargaining.  This research is important because it will             
              shed new light on the effectiveness of education reform measures               
              aimed at attracting and retaining better teachers in the public                
              schools.
