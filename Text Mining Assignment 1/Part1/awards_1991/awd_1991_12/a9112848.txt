Abstract    :
              This work is to investigate the dynamics of quantum                            
              well and bulk semi-conductor lasers.  We will study                            
              the issue related to the maximum achievable                                    
              bandwidth and optimized noise characteristics.                                 
              Critical damping which may place an upper limit on                             
              the modulation bandwidth of diode lasers will be                               
              studied in a variety of quantum well and bulk                                  
              lasers.  Quantum well devices to be studied include                            
              single and multi-longitudinal mode lasers with single                          
              and multiple quantum wells.  For bulk lasers, we                               
              will use lasers with record breaking bandwidth (24                             
              GHz).  The work will focus on understanding the                                
              physical process (or processes) responsible for                                
              critical damping and in defining the design                                    
              parameters for achieving high bandwidth and low                                
              noise operation.  The question of whether quantum                              
              well lasers intrinsically have higher maximum                                  
              bandwidth than bulk laser is to be answered.                                   
              Our previous studies on intensity noise have                                   
              resulted in the first understanding of the cause of                            
              low frequency noise in diode lasers.  This                                     
              knowledge will be used for studying noise                                      
              translation including the effect of fiber dispersion                           
              will also be investigated.  System implications will                           
              be explored.
