Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program                 
              will help the Department of Chemistry at Florida State                         
              University acquire a Fourier-transform Raman system (FTR).  The                
              FTR will be used in research projects aimed at:                                
                                                                                             
              1.  Characterization of synthetic polymers, particularly model                 
              systems essential to understanding phase structure and its                     
              relation to other structural factors and properties.                           
                                                                                             
              2.  Development of analytical techniques for organic species in                
              complex samples, emphasizing chemometric techniques applied to                 
              Raman spectrocopy of liquids and solids.                                       
                                                                                             
              3.  Determination of conduction mechanisms and properties of                   
              conducting organic polymers.                                                   
                                                                                             
              4.  Characterization of metal binding effects on functional                    
              groups in humic and fulvic acids.                                              
                                                                                             
              5.  Study of surface chemistry of thermally and chemically                     
              modified silica gels.                                                          
                                                                                             
              Raman Spectroscopy is concerned with vibrational and rotational                
              transitions in molecules.  The information obtained sometimes                  
              complements that obtained from an infrared study and provides                  
              valuable structural information.  Fourier-transform Raman                      
              spectroscopy with near-infrared excitation provides a powerful                 
              solution to problems of high background fluorescene or sample                  
              photodegradation, as well as enhanced signal-to-noise quality.                 
              Raman spectroscopy is an invaluable tool in studies of                         
              condensed-phase chemical and biomolecular systems.
