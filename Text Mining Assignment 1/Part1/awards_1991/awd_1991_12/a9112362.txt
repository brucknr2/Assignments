Abstract    :
              This award provides for procurement of a general purpose                       
              neurocomputer and data acquisition units to support several                    
              experimental engineering research projects.  The projects include              
              (1) neural network controller design for real time force control               
              of rigid or flexible robot manipulators and more general control-              
              structure interaction problems, and (2) implementation of                      
              hierarchical intelligent controllers.  These neural network based              
              controllers require a massively parallel computer architecture                 
              and high communication bandwidth between its processing elements.              
              The equipment purchased has these characteristics.
