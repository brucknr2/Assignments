Abstract    :
                     Many factors are known to influence the abundance and                   
              diversity of insects that feed on plants.  These include host                  
              plant characteristics such as nutrition and secondary compounds,               
              attack by predators/parasites, and abiotic factors such as                     
              temperature and humidity.  Microorganisms such as bacteria,                    
              viruses, and fungi commonly associated with plants can also                    
              influence where insects settle and how well they fare.  One                    
              class of microorganisms, endophytic fungi, live benignly within                
              leaf tissues but appear to protect plants from insect attack by                
              producing deterrent toxins.  This idea has not been broadly                    
              tested however, particularly in plants other than grasses.                     
                     Toward this end, the role of endophytic fungus                          
              (Chaetophoma quercifolia and several other species) in                         
              colonization, dispersal, and survival of a leafmining insect                   
              (Cameraria sp. nov.) and the southwestern tent caterpillar                     
              (Malacosoma incurvum) on Emory oak (Quercus emoryi) will be                    
              studied.  The following are to be investigated: 1) how the                     
              distribution of fungi, insects, and plant characteristics are                  
              related, 2) seasonal and yearly variation in the diversity and                 
              abundance of fungi, 3) if endophytic fungi affect survival and                 
              growth of leafminers and other oak-feeding insects.  This work                 
              will serve to address fundamental ecological questions, as well                
              as increase our knowledge and understanding of microorganisms as               
              potential biological control agents.
