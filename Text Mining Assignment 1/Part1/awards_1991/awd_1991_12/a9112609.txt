Abstract    :
              This project provides resources to procure the elements of a                   
              testbed for investigating the fundamental concepts and                         
              feasibility of damage mitigating control and its design.  The                  
              problem is as follows.  More often than not, controller design                 
              for many processes focuses on optimization of dynamic performance              
              under constraints that do not include or represent the structural              
              or material limits of the system components.  The equipment                    
              secured through this award supports research which addresses                   
              generic design methodology which would provide a trade-off                     
              between system dynamic performance and its life span.  The hope                
              and intent are that such an enhanced controller will reduce the                
              detrimental effects of fatigue, creep, and wear of system                      
              components.  The equipment itself comprises an electro-mechanical              
              shaker system, and computer and data acquisition systems.
