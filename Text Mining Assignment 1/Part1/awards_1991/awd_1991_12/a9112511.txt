Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The primary objective of this U.S.-Poland research between Dr.                 
              Janet G. Osteryoung of North Carolina State University and                     
              Zbigniew Stojek of the University of Warsaw, Poland, is to                     
              investigate analytical pulse voltammetry.  The researchers will                
              employ pulse voltammetric techniques in these areas:  (1) host-                
              guest chemistry, to elucidate fundamental kinetic and                          
              thermodynamic molecules; (2) analysis of benzodiazepine                        
              tranquillizers by adsorptive stripping voltammetry for                         
              chromatographic detection; (3) normal and reverse pulse                        
              voltammetry in resistive media; and (4) a comparison of staircase              
              voltammetry with linear scan voltammetry for systems involving                 
              adsorption.  Results are expected to advance understanding                     
              voltammetric techniques employing stepwise changes in potential.               
                                                                                             
              This project in electrochemistry fulfills the program objective of             
              advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the              
              United States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary                      
              talents and pool resources in areas of strong mutual interest and              
              competence.
