Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The equipment in this grant is used for research in several                    
              projects, including in particular:  1) SOx Removal and                         
              Concentration from Flue Gas Through and Electrochemical                        
              Membrane, 2) Electrochemical Membrane H2S Removal from Fuel                    
              Gas Streams, and 3) High Temperature H2S Fuel Cells.  The                      
              equipment consists of a controlled atmosphere furnace system                   
              for temperature to 1700C.  This system consists first of a                    
              box furnace capable of researching temperature up to 1200C                    
              (Lindberg Model 51542-HR), an inert atmosphere retort which                    
              fits insides the furnace chamber and is capable of                             
              withstanding temperatures up to 1090C (Lindberg Model 59154-                  
              H), and a programmable temperature control console which is                    
              capable of controlling the heating and cooling rates,                          
              maintaining a set point temperature, and preventing                            
              temperature overshoots (Lindberg Model 58114-P-B).  This                       
              equipment allows the processing of hygroscopic materials or                    
              reactive materials over a wide temperature range.  An                          
              additional higher-temperature enclosure allows the processing                  
              of ceramic materials used in the experiments outlined in the                   
              subsequent sections of this request (Lindberg Model 51644).                    
              The results are important in chemical reactor technology and                   
              in environmental applications.
