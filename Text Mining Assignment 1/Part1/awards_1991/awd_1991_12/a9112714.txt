Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              An electronic, on-line Directory of Marine Scientists could be a               
              valuable asset to the Oceanographic scientific community and to the            
              government agencies working with this community. This effort is to             
              conduct a one-year pilot-scale project to test the feasibility of              
              developing such a Directory.  The Division of Ocean Sciences'                  
              mailing list will be used to determine such factors as set-up and              
              maintenance costs, issues of privacy, and the extent of cooperation            
              and commitment from other agencies and professional societies. The             
              results of this project will be an updated and verified data base              
              from which OCE will be able to generate a mailing list and labels              
              and the information needed to make a reasonable judgement as to the            
              feasibility of a full-scale on-line directory.//
