Abstract    :
              This is a request for partial support of U.S.                                  
              participation in a Joint Symposium with Japan on drug                          
              delivery systems.  The Symposium, first of its kind, will                      
              take place on Dec. 16-20, 1991 in Hawaii.  The technology                      
              of making systems that deliver drugs continuously in                           
              controlled amounts is developing rapidly, and this                             
              Symposium will be an important step in exchanging                              
              information with Japanese scientists.
