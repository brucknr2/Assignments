Abstract    :
              In recent years, scholars have begun to explore how notions about              
              gender have shaped the priorities, methods, and subject matter of              
              science.  While historians of science have studied many aspects of             
              gender influences on science, there remains large areas that need              
              to be explored if we are to understand the pervasiveness of these              
              influences.  Dr. Schiebinger is examining gender influences on what            
              might be called the very skeleton of biological sciences--that is,             
              its classification system.  The studies of species, their                      
              relationships to each other and their evolution are dependent upon             
              and reflected in the classification system.  Dr. Schiebinger is                
              examining how gender influenced the formative stages of natural                
              historical classification.  She argues that notions of gender lay              
              at the heart of 18th century revolutions in views of nature.  This             
              interdisciplinary and historical study divides into three parts,               
              dealing separately with the vegetable, animal and mineral kingdoms.            
              Topics to be explored include:  the social and political                       
              circumstances surrounding the sexualization of plants (a key event             
              in the revolution in 18th century botanical taxonomy); the question            
              of why (considering the alternatives) mammals are called mammals-              
              -a term which in the 1750's supplanted the term quadruped that had             
              been used since Aristotle; an analysis of the first scientific                 
              representations of primates; and a study of attempts to classify               
              humans by race and by sex, a topic only recently of interest to                
              historians of science.  These developments are being considered in             
              a context of broader social trends affecting the development of                
              science.
