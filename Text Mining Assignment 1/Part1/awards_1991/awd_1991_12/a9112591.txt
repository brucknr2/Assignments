Abstract    :
              In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the                       
              Chemistry Division, Gordon will perform experimental studies to                
              provide a quantitative test of several aspects of unimolecular                 
              and bimolecular reaction rate theory.  The questions to be                     
              addressed include the breakdown of conventional transition                     
              state theory, the contribution of tunneling to bimolecular                     
              reaction rates, and the disposal and correlation of angular                    
              momentum.  The effect of unusual mass combinations, high                       
              potential energy barriers, and multiple transition states on                   
              each of the phenomena being studied will be determined.                        
              %%%                                                                            
              The goal of the current studies is to test several aspects of                  
              two reaction rate theories in order to better understand at a                  
              fundamental level the various factors which affect bulk                        
              reaction rates.  With such information, one might be able to                   
              control the direction of a given reaction by setting conditions                
              to favor one product channel over another, thereby, for                        
              example, increasing yields of commercially important reactions.
