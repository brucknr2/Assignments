Abstract    :
              Gardner         The cyclostationarity property of communications and  telemetry
              signals enables the generation of spectral lines with  appropriate nonlinear
              transformations, and renders fluctuations  in distinct spectral bands
              statistically dependent. The  frequencies at which spectral lines can be
              generated are directly  related to the separations between dependent spectral
              bands,  which in turn are directly related to carrier frequencies, keying 
              rates, pulse rates, and so on, in the signal. These inherent  properties of
              cyclostationary signals can be exploited to great  advantage for numerous tasks
              in signal processing. The objectives  of this research are:  1.     to
              investigate new cyclostationarity-exploiting methods for  identifying the
              kernels in the Volterra series representation of  time-invariant and
              multiply-periodic time-variant nonlinear  systems; and  2.     to further
              develop the recently introduced cyclic temporal  and spectral moment and
              cumulant theory of higher-order  cyclostationarity, with application to
              designing higher-order  spectral-line generators for signal detection and
              identification,  and for signal parameter estimation and synchronization.
