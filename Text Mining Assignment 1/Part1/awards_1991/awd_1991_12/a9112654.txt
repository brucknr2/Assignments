Abstract    :
                   This award will support four postdoctoral visitors per year at            
              the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences (CIMS), New York                
              University.  The purpose of the CIMS Visitors Program is to expose             
              new Ph.D.s to problems of applied interest from a wide variety of              
              fields (fluid flow, statistical mechanics, biology, etc.) and to               
              the mathematical tools (partial differential equations, small and              
              large-scale computation, etc.) appropriate to their solution.  This            
              marriage of pure and applied mathematics was pioneered at CIMS                 
              under the direction of Richard Courant.  The open character of the             
              Institute encourages contact between visitors, faculty and                     
              students, participation in a wide variety of seminars and advanced             
              courses of instruction in both pure and applied mathematics, and               
              collaborative work crossing the conventional lines of                          
              specialization.
