Abstract    :
              This award provides equipment to support research on noise and                 
              vibration at Purdue University.  Specifically, the equipment                   
              comprises a hydraulic vibration test system, a multi-channel data              
              acquisition system, a laser vibrometer and a portable digital                  
              tape recording system.  The research topics include (1) non-                   
              linear modelling of transportation vehicle components, (2) new                 
              models of vibration and low frequency structure borne noise in                 
              complex built up structures, (3) novel noise and vibration                     
              control techniques using active control and intelligent                        
              structures, and (4) novel vibration and acoustic measurement                   
              techniques which utilize the capabilities of modern data                       
              acquisition systems (i.e., acoustic holography, multiple                       
              coherence and principal component analysis.
