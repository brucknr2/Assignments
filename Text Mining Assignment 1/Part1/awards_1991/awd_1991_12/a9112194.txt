Abstract    :
              The proposed conference deals with two topics that are                         
              clearly inter-related but have not been dealt with together                    
              previously.  Research over the last several years has                          
              revealed that several bacterial and eukaryotic RNA processing                  
              enzymes possess an RNA component that in itself has catalytic                  
              activity.  Interest in such enzymes and catalytic RNAs has                     
              been broad and progress rapid, leading to the award of the                     
              Nobel Prize to workers in the area in 1989.  Recently,                         
              research in bacterial mRNA decay has also been vigorous,                       
              although the process is still poorly defined.  However, the                    
              decay of mRNA is formally similar to RNA processing and very                   
              recent work, from several American, European and Japanese                      
              laboratories, indicates that these two processes have                          
              components in common.  The objective of the conference is to                   
              provide a forum where workers in these two rapidly moving                      
              areas can interact and exchange information.                                   
              The meeting has the sponsorship of the American Society of                     
              Microbiology.  It is to be organized by Drs. David Apirion                     
              and Donald Nierlich at a site on the U.S. Eastern seaboard,                    
              and held October 27-31, 1991.  Seven regular sessions and                      
              three poster sessions are planned.  An opening talk is to be                   
              given by Dr. Sydney Altman (New Haven) and the closing talk                    
              by Dr. Marianne Grunberg-Manago (Paris).
