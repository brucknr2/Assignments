Abstract    :
                   This action provides for a statistical survey of the                      
              scientific and technical resources utilized by domestic companies              
              in the performance of research and development (R&D) activities.               
              This survey will produce measures of the dollar volume of                      
              research and development performed, sources of finance,                        
              employment of R&D scientists and engineers, and other                          
              characteristics of R&D and S&T in industry.                                    
                   Under authority granted by the National Science Foundation                
              Act of 1950, NSF collects and disseminates descriptive economic                
              statistics, as well as other pertinent information, about                      
              scientific and technological resource utilization and activities.              
                   Data collected by the Survey of Research and Development in               
              Industry, when used in combination with data obtained through                  
              other NSF statistical and analytical activities, provides policy               
              makers with an overview of R&D funding and performance in the                  
              United States.
