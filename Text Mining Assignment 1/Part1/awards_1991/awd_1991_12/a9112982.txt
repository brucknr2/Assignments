Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              Attitudes toward racial minorities can have powerful effects on the            
              voting behavior of Americans.  This is true even in the great                  
              majority of campaigns where candidates avoid explicit references               
              to race or direct appeals to racial attitudes.  This doctoral                  
              dissertation research explores the psychological processes through             
              which race can influence the voters' evaluations of candidates in              
              the absence of explicit racial messages.                                       
                                                                                             
              Specifically this study draws upon theories from cognitive                     
              psychology to develop and test a psychologically realistic model               
              both of the process by which voters draw inferences about the                  
              racial positions of candidates and of the effects these inferences             
              have on support for candidates.  A series of laboratory experiments            
              involving fictitious candidates and campaigns will be conducted in             
              which the effects of various campaign slogans are assessed.                    
                                                                                             
              When completed this study will increase our understanding of the               
              continuing effects of race on political attitudes and behavior in              
              the United States.
