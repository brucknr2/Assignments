Abstract    :
              The 9th International Symposium on Affinity Chromatography and                 
              Biological Recognition will meet in Yokohama, Japan in October,                
              1991.  This symposium, now in its 18th year, is the biennial                   
              meeting of investigators in the areas of affinity chromatography               
              and the many fields related to it.                                             
                                                                                             
              Affinity chromatography is an exceptionally important area at the              
              present time, due chiefly to its significant relationship to                   
              recombinant DNA and related areas of biotechnology.  This meeting              
              allows leaders of the field to exchange information with one                   
              another in both formal and informal settings and, more                         
              importantly, permits new investigators, who have just entered                  
              this area, to interact with established investigators and with                 
              each other in formulating new and exciting lines of                            
              investigation.                                                                 
                                                                                             
              The results of this meeting will be published in a symposium                   
              issue of the Journal of Chromatography.
