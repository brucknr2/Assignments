Abstract    :
                   An integral component of the multi-agency U.S. Global Change              
              Research Program (Our Changing Planet," Committee on Earth                     
              Sciences, 1991) is understanding and modeling the geospace                     
              environment.  As part of its contribution to the U.S. Global                   
              Change  Research Program, the National Science Foundation's                    
              Division of Atmospheric Sciences has established a new research                
              initiative,  Geospace Environment Modeling (GEM), with the goal                
              of supporting basic research into the dynamical and structural                 
              properties of geospace, leading to the construction of a global                
              geospace model with predictive capability.                                     
                   The subjects of the first GEM campaign are the                            
              magnetospheric boundary, the magnetosheath beyond it, and the                  
              connection from the boundary through the magnetosphere to the                  
              ionosphere.                                                                    
                   This grant is designed to integrate on-going measurements of              
              magnetic field fluctuations at conjugate locations (Iqaluit,                   
              Canada, and South Pole, Antarctica) at high geomagnetic                        
              latitudes with other measurements to be carried out under the GEM              
              Program in order to obtain a more "global" description of the                  
              dayside magnetopause environment.  Of particular interest will be              
              the study on a "global" scale of magnetic impulse events, which                
              appear to delineate regions of localized magnetic field-aligned                
              currents.
