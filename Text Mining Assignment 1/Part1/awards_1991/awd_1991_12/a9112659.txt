Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The process by which candidates for the presidency are selected is             
              central to the relationship between the American people and their              
              leaders.  Yet, although the behavior of voters in the general                  
              election has been studied extensively, research concerning the                 
              behavior of candidates in the primaries is embryonic.  This                    
              research attempts to correct this neglect by developing and testing            
              a dynamic, process model of presidential nomination campaigns.                 
                                                                                             
              Specifically, a model is proposed of the relationship between                  
              candidates' resource decisions across the primary campaign, the                
              results of the primaries, and the candidates' success.  The model              
              will be tested using data on candidate spending and election                   
              outcomes during the past six and the 1992 presidential primary                 
              campaigns.  Interviews with the candidates in 1992 will provide a              
              further test of the model's validity.                                          
                                                                                             
              When completed this ambitious research should greatly increase our             
              understanding of presidential campaigns.  The results should be of             
              significance in helping to evaluate reform proposals to alter                  
              presidential primaries by creating regional or national primaries              
              or by altering public financing.
