Abstract    :
              Funds are being sought to to purchase new refregiration                        
              equipment for Iowa Institute of Hydraulic Research (IIHR)                      
              which will be dedicated to support research on mechanical                      
              properties of ice, investigation into mechanical behavior                      
              of rubble ice as a function of load, time and temperature,                     
              processes involved in the formation of frazil ice and                          
              aufeis, and the mechanical properties                                          
              of ice-rich frozen soil.
