Abstract    :
              The major objective of this project is to synthesize by a newly                
              divised method a sufficient quantity of 2-azido ?32p! palmitoyl CoA            
              for photolabeling specific mitochondrial membrane proteins, namely             
              the ADP/ATP carrier from beef heart mitochondria and the uncoupling            
              protein from brown fat mitochondria.  Following purification and               
              cleavage of the photolabeled proteins, the radioactive peptide                 
              amino acids will be sequenced to mp the acyl CoA and possibly the              
              nucleotide binding sites.  The ADP/ATP carrier will be photolabeled            
              from both the cytosolic and matrix sides of the inner mitochondrial            
              membrane with the aim of differentiating between a single or two               
              distinct binding sites.  The amino acid profiles of the acyl CoA               
              binding sites on the ADP/ATP carrier and uncoupling protein will be            
              compared for the degree of homology of these two similar proteins.             
              Long chain acyl CoA esters are recognized to be biological                     
              regulatory ligands for a number of important enzymes.  These                   
              experiments will provide for the first time pertinent biochemical              
              information on the mechanism of regulation of cellular                         
              bioenergetics by acyl CoA esters.  Furthermore, it is anticipated              
              that 2-azido palmitoyl CoA will prove very useful in screening for             
              the co-valent binding of a number of membrane and soluble proteins             
              which are modulated by acyl CoA esters.
