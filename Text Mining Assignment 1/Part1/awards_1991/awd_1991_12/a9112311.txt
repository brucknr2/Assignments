Abstract    :
              The main objectives of the proposed Symposium/Workshop are: 1) to              
              stress the current state of knowledge and practice in computational            
              mechanics in structural engineering and to identify the frontal                
              joint research opportunities necessary to advance the current state            
              of knowledge; 2) to stimulate future cooperative research and                  
              development in the areas of common needs and greatest importance;              
              3) to evaluate the results of chinese research programs on                     
              computational structural mechanics and their practical applications            
              in the U.S.; and 4) to continue to build the existing long-term                
              bilateral scientific relationship between academic and practicing              
              communities.
