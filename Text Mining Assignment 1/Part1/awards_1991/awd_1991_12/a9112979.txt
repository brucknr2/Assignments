Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award is for the development of an SEM-based micro-                       
              characterization facility, with optimized cathodoluminesence and               
              charge collection capabilities for electronic materials research.              
              A demonstration model scanning electron microscope and components              
              for cathodoluminesence and charge collection studies will be                   
              purchased.  Current areas of materials research include selective              
              area growth of heteroepitaxial semiconductors, large bandgap                   
              semiconductors, and fine particles.  Cathodoluminesence and charge             
              collection are characterization methods essential for addressing               
              issues such as materials uniformity, analysis of luminesence in                
              wide bandgap materials, stress distributions in selective epitaxial            
              growth, and degradation of optoelectronic devices.  The SEM will               
              have full variable temperature capability and microscopy and                   
              spectroscopy modes.  Examples of researchproposed include selective            
              area GaAs/Si, diamond films, SiC films and quantum well devices.               
              Researchers and students from several of the departments at the                
              University ofCalifornia-Los Angeles will make use of this                      
              instrument.
