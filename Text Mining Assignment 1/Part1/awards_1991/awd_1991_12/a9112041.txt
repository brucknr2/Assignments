Abstract    :
              This proposal is a theoretical investigation into Solar                        
              Atmospheric Electric fields.  Electric fields play a crucial role              
              in the dynamics, heating and acceleration of magnetized solar                  
              plasmas.  In spite of its importance, the study of solar electric              
              fields has been neglected compared with that of the magnetic                   
              field.  The situation has been gradually improving in the                      
              lastfifteen years with the reports of electric field detection in              
              various solar structures.  Recently, the sensitivity of the                    
              electric field detection has increased remarkably to less than 10              
              V/cm (Moran and Foukal 1990).  Since higher quality data will be               
              available soon, now is a good time to initiate a vigorous                      
              theoretical investigation of the solar electric fields to                      
              compliment the observational effort.
