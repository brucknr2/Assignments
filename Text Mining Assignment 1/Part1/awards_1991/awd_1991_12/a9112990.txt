Abstract    :
                   The project will analyze the interactions of micro and macro              
              changes which occur during mold filling and curing in resin                    
              transfer molding (RTM) and structural reaction injection molding               
              (SRIM) processes.  The objectives are (1) to quantify the                      
              interactions between fiber wetting and molding filling during resin            
              injection and (2) to quantify the interactions between interface               
              bonding and matrix reaction during curing.  The knowledge gained               
              will be used to develop and optimize several new processing                    
              techniques for mass production of continuous fiber reinforced                  
              thermoset composites.  A systematic experimental and theoretical               
              analysis will be conducted.  The mold filling analysis includes                
              microscopic flow visualization, dynamic wettability measurement,               
              pressure profile measurement inside the fiber reinforcement, flow              
              tracing and fiber distribution measurement in molded composites,               
              and process modelling.  The curing study includes kinetic analysis             
              by FTIR and FTIR-PLC spectroscopy, interface strength analysis and             
              mechanical property measurement.  Fiber reinforcements used will               
              be glass fibers in the form of continuous random mats, stitched                
              unidirectional and bidirectional mats, and untreated and sized                 
              single fiber filaments.  Resins used will be low viscosity                     
              polyurethanes, unsaturated polyesters and  their hybrids.                      
                   The study will allow the rational design of molded parts                  
              produced from dies and processes for the molding of composite                  
              materials and such understanding will improve the efficiency of                
              such processes.
