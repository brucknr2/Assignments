Abstract    :
              This is an award to support research on the environmental                      
              reduction of chromium from the hexavalent to the trivalent                     
              state by contact with mineral and humic substances in                          
              soil, a reduction process that can be influenced by                            
              interactions with aqueous ions, electron transfers at                          
              mineral surfaces, reaction with simple organic molecules                       
              or by interactions with soil humic substances.  This                           
              research involves determination of the oxidation-reduction                     
              processes that affect the transport and fate of hexavalent                     
              chromium in soil as influenced by ionic strength and                           
              background electrolytes.                                                       
                                                                                             
              Results are expected to be used in the development of                          
              mathematical models that characterize the process by which                     
              chromium is chemically reduced and physically transformed                      
              to a less environmentally damaging form.  Chromium is an                       
              important industrial metal that finds its way into surface                     
              and groundwaters by leakage from waste management sites.                       
              The results of this project are expected to be used in                         
              development of models and techniques that can be used in                       
              planning the engineering design of remediation measures                        
              that can be used to reduce the pollutional impact of                           
              chromium discharges on surface and groundwater.
