Abstract    :
              This is an award to provide support for purchase of                            
              engineering research equipment to permit determination of                      
              organic carbon concentrations in samples of aquifer                            
              solids, sediments, soil, microbial biomass, groundwater                        
              and suspended water droplets in the atmosphere.  The                           
              equipment to be purchased with this support consists of a                      
              Dohrmann High Temperature Total Organic Carbon Analyzer                        
              and accessories consisting of a Boat Sampler, an                               
              Autosampler, and a Hewlett Packard Thinkjet Printer.                           
                                                                                             
              The proposal leading to this award was submitted in                            
              response to the Program Announcement and Guidelines NSF                        
              90-146, Research Equipment Grant Program.  The equipment                       
              is expected to enhance the investigator's ability to                           
              conduct research on soil-water partitioning, of                                
              significance in groundwater contamination and engineering                      
              approaches to dealing with this environmental problem.                         
              The equipment will also provide significant support for                        
              other research projects being conducted by the co-                             
              investigators.
