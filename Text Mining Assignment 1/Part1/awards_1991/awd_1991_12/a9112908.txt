Abstract    :
                                                                                              
              This research is concerned with the physical processes                        
              underlying the magnetically dominated energy-conversion processes              
              that drive solar-terrestrial activity.  The methodology involves               
              the formation of an MHD treatment of transport-enriched                        
              evolution and instability processes, and their multi-dimensional               
              nonlinear simulation onsupercomputers.  The proposed program                   
              involves analytical and computational plasma physics, illuminated              
              by the study of solar-activity measurements.  It is planned to                 
              extend both the physical accuracy and solar applications of past               
              computer simulations.  Convective energization and reconnection                
              of magnetic structures will be detailed, as well as the dynamic                
              magnetic response (and support of) gravitating prominences,  the               
              speed-up of flare reconnection, and the evolution and activity of              
              coronal streamers.  These studies are motivated by the desire to               
              understand related phenomena in the wider universe of                          
              astrophysics, and by the need to predict their consequences in                 
              the solar-terrestrial system.
