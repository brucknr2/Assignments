Abstract    :
              This is a grant for research equipment to support                              
              the fabrication and testing of piezoelectric sensors                           
              that operate in the megahertz to gigahertz                                     
              frequency range.  The most extensive research                                  
              project that will be supported by this equipment                               
              involves a surface acoustic wave (SAW)                                         
              microsensor for gas detection.  Other research                                 
              projects include the study of properties and                                   
              adhesion of polyimide films with SAW sensors, the                              
              study of an acoustic plate mode biosensor and the                              
              study of slurries using acoustic wave devices.
