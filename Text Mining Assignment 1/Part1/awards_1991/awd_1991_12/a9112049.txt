Abstract    :
              An engineering research equipment award will fund the purchase of              
              a materials testing controller and associated instrumentation.  The            
              equipment will be installed as attachments to an existing materials            
              testing machine.  It will be used in measurements of friction                  
              forces in the very small motions which are typical of robots.  The             
              results will be used to modify and validate a model of friction.
