Abstract    :
              Modern X-ray diffraction (XRD) equipment is requested.  The                    
              capabilities of the new equipment will include a powder                        
              diffractometer with a heating stage, glancing angle incidence                  
              optics for thin film and multilayer characterization, and a                    
              dedicated double-crystal X-ray diffractometer for defect                       
              characterization of strained-layer epitaxial thin films.                       
                                                                                             
              A study on thermal oxidation of ceramic and intermetallic matrix               
              composites by in situ heating in an X-ray diffractometer and                   
              correlation with mechanical behavior is anticipated.  Another                  
              research program that will benefit strongly from the new                       
              instrument, is analytical characterization of ceramic composites               
              synthesized by the novel Chemical Vapor Infiltration (CVI)                     
              technique.  Similarly, XRD work will be applied to chemically vapor            
              deposited ceramic thin films for protective coating applications,              
              as well as investigating in situ environmental reactions and                   
              microstructural changes as a function of temperature.  For                     
              semiconductor thin films and multilayers, determination of phase               
              stability and alloy formation by high temperature X-ray                        
              diffractometer is important for optimization of sequential                     
              processing steps that won't compromise device performance.
