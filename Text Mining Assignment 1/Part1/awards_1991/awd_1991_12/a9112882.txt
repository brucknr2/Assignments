Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              In 1989 and 1990, competitive elections were held in the Soviet                
              Union for the first time in decades.  The all-Union and republican             
              legislatures that subsequently were convened also feature, again               
              for the first time, open political debate, non-unanimous voting,               
              and recorded public votes by the legislators. With the weakening               
              of the Communist Party, ethnic cleavages have begun to be apparent             
              in these legislatures.  Whether and how the representatives of                 
              various ethnic interests are able to build effective political                 
              coalitions or form effective political parties is of extreme                   
              interest not only to the future of democracy in the Soviet Union               
              but also to social scientific theories about legislative coalition             
              building more generally.                                                       
                                                                                             
              This research will analyze the formation and evolution of political            
              alliances in soviet legislatures.  The project will focus on the               
              way in which ethnic cleavages become associated both with different            
              patterns of political accommodation and confrontation, and with                
              different patterns of party formation.  Data will be collected on              
              the voting decisions of legislators in the all-Union legislature               
              and in the legislatures of five union republics.  In addition to               
              providing the basis for the current study, the data will provide               
              valuable data for a variety of future studies interested in                    
              tracking the process of democratization in the Soviet Union.
