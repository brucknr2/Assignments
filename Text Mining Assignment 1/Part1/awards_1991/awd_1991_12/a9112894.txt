Abstract    :
              This project supports the dissertation research of a cultural                  
              anthropologist studying the nature of Turkish ethnic identity in               
              North Cyprus.  Two competing alternatives, the "purely Turkish"                
              and the "Cypriot" compete for the allegiance of the population.                
              The project will investigate how adherents of each position                    
              redefine the critical period of history from Cypriot independence              
              (1960) to the division of the island into two separate ethnic                  
              communities (1974) to support their political goals.  Methods                  
              include the examination of archives of official documents as well              
              as in-depth interviews and participant observation.                            
                                                                                             
              This research is important because ethnic identity and                         
              contestation seems to be an increasing feature of the modern                   
              world.  Understanding how, and why similar groups define                       
              themselves as different can help policy makers cope with the                   
              resulting antagonisms.
