Abstract    :
                   Professor Bennett will continue his research on "elementary               
              inequalities," i.e. those involving matrices with non-negative                 
              entries.  The main objective is to find norm estimates for                     
              various matrix transformations between sequence spaces.                        
              Applications are to probability theory, function theory,                       
              orthogonal series, and the general theory of inequalities.                     
                   Mathematical analysis at the working level is often a matter              
              of the ingenious manipulation of inequalities.  For instance,                  
              there is a famous inequality asserting that the sum of products                
              of two sequences of positive numbers is not greater than the                   
              square root of the sum of squares of the first sequence times the              
              analogous expression for the second.  This fact and countless                  
              others like it constitutes the basic information out of which                  
              analytic arguments are spun.  The research of Professor Bennett                
              aims at fundamental enrichment of this store of facts.
