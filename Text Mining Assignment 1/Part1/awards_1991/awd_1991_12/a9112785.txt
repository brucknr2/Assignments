Abstract    :
              The focus of the research is five-fold.  Studies will be                       
              conducted on the synthesis and chemistry of novel single-atom                  
              peri-bridged arenes and their derivatives; the products,                       
              stereochemistry and mechanisms of pentacoordinate                              
              addition-rearrangement-reactions of alpha-haloalkylsilanes with                
              nucleophiles will be probed; new reagents and methods will be                  
              developed for generating diazo compounds, their carbenes and                   
              subsequent products; studies will be carried out to better                     
              understand steric and electrical effects in carbenic                           
              reaarangement processes and the chemistry of metallodiazo                      
              compounds and metallocarbenes.                                                 
                                                                                             
              With this renewal award, the Synthetic Organic Program is                      
              supporting the research of Dr. Harold Shechter of the                          
              Department of Chemistry at Ohio State University.  Professor                   
              Shechter will probe a variety of novel structure types and                     
              chemical reactions.  These include pentacoordinate silicon                     
              compounds, strained-bridged aromatics, and unusual carbenoid                   
              compounds and precursors.
