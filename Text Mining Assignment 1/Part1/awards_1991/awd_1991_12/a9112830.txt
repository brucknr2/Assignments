Abstract    :
              Research will be undertaken to study nonperturbatively the role of             
              anharmonicity for vibrations of random networks; to conduct                    
              numerical calculations of inelastic scattering amplitudes from                 
              vibrating fractal structures; to study the scaling properties of               
              the sound velocity for mixed amorphous materials; and, to                      
              investigate the nuclear spin relaxation in dilute hole-doped high              
              temperature superconductors.                                                   
              %%%                                                                            
              Certain disordered materials exhibit structures which are best                 
              described by fractals.  The proposed research uses the model of                
              fractons, or excitations on a fractal structure, to interpret                  
              various physical properties of these disordered materials.                     
              Additional work will be conducted on nuclear relaxation in the high            
              temperature superconductors.
