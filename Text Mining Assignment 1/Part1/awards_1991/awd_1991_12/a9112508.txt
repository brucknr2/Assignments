Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Kreitzberg will study winter fronts and weather using data                
              sets from special observational programs (GALE, 1986; and                      
              STORMFEST, 1992) in comparison with detailed numerical model                   
              solution fields.  The goal is to determine the role of fronts in               
              producing clouds and precipitation in winter.  The hypothesis is               
              that the role of strong fronts in producing these patterns is                  
              substantial, but that it has been obscured until now by the lack of            
              high resolution (mesoscale) information on the structure of the                
              phenomena.  A key task will be to determine how well models can                
              reproduce frontal structures that can be resolved in the special               
              data sets.  The research includes participation in the STORMFEST               
              experiment particularly in directing the research aircraft, the                
              King Air, in its surveys of these structures.  Detailed, real-time             
              model predictions will be used to guide research aircraft                      
              deployment and interpretation of mesoscale observations in these               
              regions.  This novel approach, if successful, will be a                        
              breakthrough in the conduct of mesoscale field experiments.  It has            
              the potential for much more economical and effective use of                    
              relatively expensive aircraft as research platforms in already                 
              scheduled experimental components of the U.S. Weather Research                 
              Program over the next decade.
