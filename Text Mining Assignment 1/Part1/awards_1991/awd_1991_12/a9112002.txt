Abstract    :
              Professor Wilse G. Robinson is supported by a grant from the                   
              Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to use                         
              picocosecond laser spectroscopic techniques to probe the                       
              structure and dynamics of water as it exists in confined                       
              volumes.  Studies will be conducted on interfacial water at the                
              water/air interface, water in contact with hydrophopic and                     
              hydrophilic surfaces, and water in close proximity to ions.                    
              Robinson will also use fluorescence probing techniques to study                
              water in biological systems including water contained in ion                   
              channels, near membrane walls, and inside reversed micelles.                   
              %%%                                                                            
              These studies will provide fundamental insight into the                        
              behavior of water, the most important solvent, in the vicinity                 
              of ions, at interfaces between phases, and in biological                       
              systems.
