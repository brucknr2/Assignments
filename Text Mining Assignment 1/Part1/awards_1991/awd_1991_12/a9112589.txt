Abstract    :
                   In this project the principal investigator will study the                 
              stability of steady solutions of the system of partial                         
              differential equations that describes the behavior of an                       
              electrically conducting fluid under the influence of an external               
              magnetic field.  In particular, she will derive energy estimates               
              of the solutions of an interesting physical phenomenon that                    
              couples fluid dynamical effects with electromagnetic effects in                
              an inherently nonlinear way.                                                   
                   Many fluid-flow phenomena of importance in science and                    
              technology today involve complicated fluids that are subjected to              
              many different types of forces.  In this project the principal                 
              investigator will look into the stability of steady (i.e., time-               
              independent) solutions of the system of equations that models the              
              behavior of an electrically conducting fluid that is under the                 
              influence of thermal and magnetic forces.  Such flows arise in                 
              technologically vital areas like the fabrication of polymers and               
              liquid crystals and the accurate modelling of suspension flows.
