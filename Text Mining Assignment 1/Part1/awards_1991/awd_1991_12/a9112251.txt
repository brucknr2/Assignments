Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Theoretical and experimental studies are conducted on metal alloy              
              microstructural evolution during rapid thermal cycling.  Particle              
              dissolution, grain growth, liquid film formation, and subsequent               
              solidification of intergranular liquid are considered.  A physical             
              model of the process is being developed, computer simulation                   
              employed, and experimental verification pursued.  Analytical                   
              transmission electron microscopy is the primary microanalytical                
              technique.  The completed research should produce a computational              
              model of microstructural evolution during  a complete thermal cycle            
              typical of a weld heat-affected zone.                                          
              %%%                                                                            
              Many multiphase alloys are subjected to rapid thermal processing,              
              such as welding and surface modification through high energy beam              
              melting or thermal spraying.  This research will provide a verified            
              computational model applicable to these processes.
