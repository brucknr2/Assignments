Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Profound economic and social changes over the past two decades have            
              put enormous pressures on American cities and led to reorganization            
              of local political arrangements.  Except for a few large cities,               
              however, these changes are uncharted and not well understood.                  
              Among the trends that have contributed to the crisis in urban                  
              governance are: 1) the decline in public money available for local             
              development projects, 2) the consequent erosion of regulations                 
              supporting representation of minority and neighborhood interests               
              in development activities, 3) the rise of a variety of new social              
              movements (e.g. environmentalism) based on shared values rather                
              than ethnic or neighborhood identities, and 4) the shift of                    
              development decisions to non-electoral area.                                   
                                                                                             
              This research examines the interplay of these trend in eight                   
              little-studies American cities since 1980.  The research is framed             
              and interpreted in terms of urban regime theory and focuses of                 
              differences in the nature, extent, and scope of interest                       
              representation across different policy areas in these different                
              cities over time.  Aggregate statistics will be supplemented with              
              intensive interviews with political elites and the leaders of local            
              interest groups and associations.                                              
                                                                                             
              When completed this research will provide a better understanding               
              of contemporary patterns of representation in American cities and              
              help to identify the strengths and weaknesses of alternative models            
              of urban governance.
