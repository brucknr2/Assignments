Abstract    :
              This is an award to provide support for purchase of                            
              engineering research equipment to permit study of solid-                       
              fluid separation operations relating to potential                              
              applicability of cross-flow filtration to oxidation of                         
              organic material in aqueous suspension or solution using a                     
              supercritical water oxidation process.  Research to be                         
              conducted includes determination of the solid separation                       
              efficiency of the cross-flow process, behavior of the                          
              catalyst, fouling and heat transfer characteristics, and                       
              corrosion issues.                                                              
                                                                                             
              The proposal leading to this award was submitted in                            
              response to the Program Announcement and Guidelines NSF                        
              90-146, Research Equipment Grant Program.  Results are                         
              expected to provide guidance for engineering design of                         
              processes and systems to reduce or eliminate the                               
              pollutional impact of wastewater and sludges on                                
              environmental quality.
