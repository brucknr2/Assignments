Abstract    :
              An X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS) surface analysis system             
              will be purchased and constructed to support a number of studies               
              of diamond film growth.  The equipment will permit in situ studies             
              of the nature of the chemical bonds which form during film growth              
              for diamond films grown by hot filament and DC plasma co-enhanced              
              chemical vapor deposition.  The results will be used to determine              
              the growth mechanisms and details of the surface properties.
