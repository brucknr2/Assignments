Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The objectives of this research are three-fold:  (1) an                   
              experimental investigation of "cirrus" crystal growth during                   
              free-fall in an evacuated chamber; the growth of natural crystals              
              by both diffusion of vapor and riming, particularly the                        
              transition from the former to the latter as the temperature is                 
              decreased; (2) an experimental investigation, using a thermal                  
              diffusion chamber of natural ice nuclei, especially their                      
              capacity to nucleate ice as a function of supersaturation; (3)                 
              the development of a theory to explain ice crystal growth,                     
              including habitat (i.e. crystal shape).
