Abstract    :
              This grant if for the purchase of an ultra-violet                              
              spectroscopy system for research on the chemistry                              
              and thermodynamics of epitaxial growth by                                      
              chemical beam epitaxy in-situ and in real time.                                
              UV spectroscopy is a powerful scientific tool that is                          
              best suited for the study of growth processes by                               
              chemical beam epitaxy.  The equipment described                                
              in this proposal will create the capability for UV                             
              absorption spectroscopy and laser-induced                                      
              fluorescence spectroscopy.  These two techniques                               
              will be used for the investigation of epitaxial growth                         
              of III-V semiconductor and alloy microstructures.                              
              In contrast to molecular beam epitaxy in which                                 
              elemental sources are used, gas sources (metal-                                
              organics and hydrides) are used in chemical beam                               
              epitaxy.  Consequently the chemical dynamics of                                
              epitaxial growth are more complex, but easier to                               
              measure than is the case in MBE.  With the                                     
              equipment requested in this proposal, it will be                               
              possible to obtain quantitative chemical information                           
              by probing the region just above the substrate.  This                          
              equipment can provide information about the                                    
              concentrations and electronic states of molecular                              
              and atomic species.  The type of equipment needed                              
              for the UV spectroscopy described in this proposal                             
              is not available as a single unit from any supplier,                           
              and in order to perform such studies, it is necessary                          
              to assemble appropriate individual components.
