Abstract    :
                   Carbonyl compounds play central roles in the photochemistry               
              and organic chemistry of the atmosphere, but little is known                   
              about their concentrations and cycling.  Nearly all past                       
              measurements of carbonyl compounds in clean air over remote                    
              regions were restricted to formaldehyde, even though other                     
              carbonyl compounds were probably present at similar or higher                  
              concentrations.  The main objectives in this project are to                    
              elucidate the major sources and sinks of a wide variety of                     
              carbonyl compounds in the remote troposphere and to quantify                   
              these roles in tropospheric chemistry.  To achieve these goals,                
              the PI plans to perform intensive measurements of background                   
              concentrations of gas and aqueous phase carbonyl compounds, and                
              to study their variations with respect to chemical and                         
              meteorological conditions.  The work will be carried out as a                  
              part of the Mauna Loa Observatory Photochemistry Experiment II.                
              The simultaneous measurements of key compounds and parameters                  
              during this program will provide significant new information                   
              needed for modeling tropospheric chemical processes, which in                  
              turn will provide new insights into the relative importance of                 
              carbonyl compounds in tropospheric chemistry.
