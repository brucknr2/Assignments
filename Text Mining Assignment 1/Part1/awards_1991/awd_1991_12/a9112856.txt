Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Global environmental change is a prime example of what economists              
              can al externality.  Each country may produce emissions which                  
              affect the welfare of all other countries.  In choosing an                     
              appropriate level of emissions, each country will take into                    
              account the costs it imposes on itself, but may neglect or                     
              minimize the importance of the costs it imposes on others.  Even               
              if the magnitude of the potential cost are well-understood to the              
              afflicted parties, it may be difficult to design an appropriate                
              regulatory mechanism, if the regulator doesn't have access to                  
              such cost information.  This project is concerned with the                     
              theoretical and experimental investigation of compensation                     
              mechanisms, a new class of mechanisms for internalizing                        
              externalities.                                                                 
                                                                                             
              The project investigates several theoretical extensions of these               
              mechanisms, paying particular attention to different information               
              structures.  These mechanisms are also tested in the laboratory                
              to see how they work in practice.
