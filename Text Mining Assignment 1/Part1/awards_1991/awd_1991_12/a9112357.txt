Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This collaborative research (with Harmel 9112491) investigates the             
              dynamics of political party change.  It examines the mechanisms                
              that produce changes in goals, issue positions, activities, and                
              organization of parties.  Time-series data will be collected on 19             
              political parties in four countries for the period 1950-1990.                  
              These data will be used both to assess the nature and extent of                
              party change and to explain those changes in terms of environmental            
              changes, the parties' performance in elections and in government,              
              and leadership decisions.                                                      
                                                                                             
              Although focused on individual parties, this research also will be             
              important for understanding change in party systems.  An                       
              understanding of individual parties is necessary to understand                 
              changes in larger systems.  Moreover, both types of change are                 
              central theoretically to understanding the dynamic of government.              
                                                                                             
              When completed this data intensive research will increase our                  
              understanding of the dynamics of political party change. Moreover,             
              the data collected will be of lasting value to other scholars                  
              interested in political parties.
