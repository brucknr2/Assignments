Abstract    :
              Funds are requested for a three year Russian translation project               
              to be organized by the international circumpolar journal Arctic                
              Anthropology. There is an urgent need to disseminate the                       
              scholarship of Soviet anthropologists working in the Euraisna                  
              Arctic and Subarctic. Since only a few Soviet scholars are                     
              sufficienty fluent to write for English language journals,                     
              important important research contributions are off-limits to all               
              but a few Russian-reading North American scholars. This project                
              hopes to provide systematic coverage of Soviet scholarship,                    
              publishing 5-6 papers in each volume over a three year period.
