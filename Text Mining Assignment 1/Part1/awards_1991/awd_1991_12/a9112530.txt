Abstract    :
              With support from the Organic Dynamics Program, Dr. Billups                    
              will expand the recently developed vacuum gas solid reaction                   
              technique (VGSR) to the synthesis of highly unstable compounds                 
              under conditions where structural studies can be performed.                    
              Particular emphasis will be placed upon the use of solid                       
              alkalai fluoride to effect the elimination of beta-halosilanes                 
              to yield highly strained intermediates. In addition,                           
              bifunctional cycloproparenes will be polymerized with silver                   
              ion to produce a series of new aromatic materials. Finally, the                
              organic and organometallic chemistry of C-60                                   
              "Buckminsterfullerene" will be studied.                                        
              %%%                                                                            
              A major focus of Dr. Billups' research program in recent years                 
              has been the development of a vacuum gas phase procedure for                   
              synthesizing small ring compounds. This approach, which is                     
              utilized in only one other laboratory in the United States,                    
              allows the reactive species to be isolated at low temperature                  
              for subsequent chemical and structural studies. In other work,                 
              Dr. Billups will study some aspects of the chemistry of a new                  
              allotrope of carbon, "Buckminsterfullerene", which contains a                  
              cluster of sixty carbon atoms. This novel, all-carbon cluster                  
              is of considerable interest from a theoretical standpoint and                  
              also for its potential materials applications.
