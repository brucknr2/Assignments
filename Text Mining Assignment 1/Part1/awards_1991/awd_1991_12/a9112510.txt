Abstract    :
              A graphics workstation will be purchased by the Department of                  
              Chemical Engineering to visualize the suspension                               
              microstructures and evolving dynamics.  The selected system is                 
              Stardent ST3020VS.  The dynamics of microstructured fluids are                 
              simulated using Stokesian dynamics simulation.  The                            
              microstructured fluids are in the form of particles dispersed                  
              in a fluid medium where the particles interact through any                     
              combination of Brownian, colloidal, external and hydrodynamics                 
              forces.  Microstructural (particle distribution functions,                     
              etc.) anbd macroscopic (rheology, diffusivities, etc.)                         
              properties are determined under highly nonequilibrium                          
              conditions typical of those found in the processing of                         
              multiphase materials.  The goal of the work is to understand                   
              the relationship between structure and properties on the one                   
              hand and between structure and flow on the other.
