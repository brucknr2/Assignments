Abstract    :
              This project deals with the application of the Walsh                           
              transform to electric power engineering.  The Walsh                            
              transform is a mathematical transform based on                                 
              kernel Walsh functions.  These functions are square-                           
              waves and they result in compact spectra when the                              
              signal to be transformed has a similar waveshape.                              
              This application will be for electric power quality                            
              assessment.  The expectation is that the use of this                           
              transform will give new insight into models used in                            
              power distribution.
