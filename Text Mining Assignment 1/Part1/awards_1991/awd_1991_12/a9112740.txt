Abstract    :
              This research program is for the fabrication and                               
              study of the electronic properties of high-quality                             
              electron systems in GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructures                               
              which are laterally confined with atomic precision.                            
              We will make use of a new and promising                                        
              fabrication technique, namely regrowth by                                      
              molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) on the edge of an                                 
              in-situ-cleaved wafer which contains thin-film layers                          
              previously grown by MBE.  The precision of the                                 
              lateral structures (on the cleaved surface) in this                            
              technique is limited by the initial MBE growth and,                            
              therefore, is about the atomic size.  This is by far                           
              better than what is presently achievable by                                    
              conventional lithography techniques.  We propose                               
              to fabricate novel systems such as lateral resonant                            
              tunneling structures and lateral superlattices, and                            
              study their electronic properties through quantum                              
              transport measurements.
