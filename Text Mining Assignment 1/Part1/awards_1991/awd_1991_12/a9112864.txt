Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Ninth Southwestern Developmental Biology Conference will be                
              held March 21-23, 1991 in College Station, Texas. The meeting is               
              sponsored by the Society for Developmental Biology, which states               
              in its guidelines: "Regional meetings are an important activity                
              of the Society...The function of the Regional Conference is to                 
              provide a more informal opportunity than national meetings for                 
              the exchange of information on development. participation by                   
              graduate students, postdoctorals and junior faculty is                         
              particularly encouraged..." The meeting will adhere to this goal.              
              This will be achieved by inviting three prominent speakers to                  
              present different aspects of "Epigenesis". In addition,                        
              developmental biologists from the Southwestern region will be                  
              encouraged to present recent and preliminary findings from their               
              laboratories. Such an arrangement will give the students in the                
              Southwest an opportunity to give a talk, meet investigators from               
              a specialized discipline, and to increase their knowledge about                
              the range of research projects pursued in their own geographic                 
              region.
