Abstract    :
                   This project supports the dissertation research of a student              
              of linguistic anthropology from the University of Texas.  THe                  
              project studies speech styles in rural Indian education in                     
              highland Bolivia to test the hypothesis that local Indian school               
              teachers are trained in speech styles radically different from                 
              those of the Indian homes.  This creates a communicative barrier               
              between teachers and students in the elementary classroom,                     
              despite the similarity of ethnic background of teachers and                    
              students.  Methods include ethnographic observation in classrooms              
              and homes, and videotaped speech interactions and audio-taped                  
              interviews.  Analysis will target participant cultural structures              
              and interactional rules using an "ethnography of speaking"                     
              approach.                                                                      
                   This research is important because multicultural education                
              is increasing in many countries as ethnic consciousness is                     
              heightened.  Understanding the nature of ethnically-based                      
              linguistic problems between teachers and children will help                    
              educational planners design programs to maximize the potential                 
              for success in formal education of subordinated groups.
