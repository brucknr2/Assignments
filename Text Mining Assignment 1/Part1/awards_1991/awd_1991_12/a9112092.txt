Abstract    :
              Doctoral student: Sarah W. Tracy;  Dissertation Title:  "The                   
              Medicalization of Alcoholism in America, 1870-1919."                           
                                                                                             
              Under the direction of Dr. Charles Rosenberg, Ms Tracy is                      
              undertaking a socio-historical study of the late 19th and early                
              20th century attempt to "medicalize" alcohol abuse and alcoholism,             
              what was then called inebriety.  She is examining a random sample              
              of patient records from the Massachusetts Hospital for Dipsomaniacs            
              and Inebriates at the Massachusetts State Archives, newspaper                  
              accounts of the hospital found in The Foxborough Reporter contained            
              in the Foxborough Town Library, and the incompetency hearings of               
              inebriates from the New York County Court of Common Pleas contained            
              in the Division of Old Records at the New York County Clerk's                  
              Office in New York City.  These sources provide crucial insight                
              into 1) the manner in which the medical understanding of inebriety             
              altered legal practice and social welfare policy;  2) the validity             
              of the social control hypothesis as a guiding principle in the                 
              institutional treatment of inebriates; 3) the currency of the                  
              disease concept of inebriety within urban judicial and social                  
              welfare systems;  4) the influence of such variables as gender,                
              ethnicity, and socio-economic status on the classification and                 
              treatment of inebriates in a court of law and an institution                   
              specifically for the management of people with alcohol problems.               
                                                                                             
              This study promises significant contributions to the history of                
              science and to our understanding of social control processes and               
              the interaction of law and medicine.  The data collected in this               
              study will be placed in a social science archive within one                    
              calendar year of the completion of this award.
