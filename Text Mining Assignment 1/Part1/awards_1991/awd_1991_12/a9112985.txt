Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This proposed research will be a continuation of a study of               
              the long term properties of cosmic ray anisotropies in                         
              interplanetary space surrounding the earth, with emphasis on the               
              information that can be extracted from these data regarding the                
              properties and long term variations of cosmic ray density                      
              gradients in the inner heliosphere.  This work is expected to                  
              yield important information on the three-dimensional magnetic and              
              cosmic ray profile near the earth, and on the way in which it                  
              changes when the sun's polar magnetic field gradually changes,                 
              and then reverses every eleven years.  With the data obtained                  
              during the study, together with data accumulated since 1965, it                
              will be possible to examine data for a 30-year period, including               
              nearly three solar activity cycles.  This will allow us to study               
              the continuing evolution of the heliospheric magnetic field and                
              its influence on high rigidity galactic cosmic radiation in the                
              inner heliosphere.
