Abstract    :
                   The grant will support the acquisition of a Computer                      
              Numerically Controlled (CNC) surface grinder to support an existing            
              grant in the area of creep feed grinding of Alumina and Zirconia               
              ceramics with diamond wheels.  Fundamental grinding parameters have            
              been obtained to achieve stochastic characterization of unit load              
              distribution and to provide quantitative analysis of the relative              
              importance of the material removal mechanism either by fracture or             
              plastic deformation.                                                           
                   The CNC grinder will provide state-of-the-art equipment to                
              conduct research in the optimization of the ceramic grinding                   
              process parameters, to achieve cycle times that are competitive                
              with metal machining without sacrificing the strength of ground                
              structural ceramics.  The ultimate goal is to make ceramic grinding            
              cost effective and to eliminate the need for secondary operations              
              such as lapping to finish ground ceramic components.  A study of               
              wheel wear mechanisms in diamond wheels and the impact of wear on              
              strength and surface integrity of ground ceramic components will               
              also be conducted.  This should help in formulating new                        
              compositions of diamond wheels.
