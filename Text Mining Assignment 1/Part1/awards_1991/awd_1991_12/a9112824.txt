Abstract    :
                   The Triennial Symposium on Transportation Analysis (TRISTAN)              
              symposium is designed to bring together leading researchers from               
              around the world working on mathematical and algorithmic aspects               
              of transportation systems analysis, with an emphasis on logistics,             
              vehicle routing, common carrier operations,  and traffic                       
              operations.  In addition to promoting outstanding research, TRISTAN            
              brings together a group of researchers with a relatively common                
              focus, thereby encouraging the exchange of ideas and collaborative             
              research efforts.  TRISTAN is planned as a triennial symposium,                
              with the first meeting scheduled to be held at the University of               
              Montreal in June, 1991.
