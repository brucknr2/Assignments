Abstract    :
              This grant is co-funded between the Materials Theory and the                   
              Biophysics programs at NSF.  Several topics in condensed matter                
              physics will be investigated.  The primary emphasis will be on gel             
              electrophoresis, a topic of great importance in biology and                    
              materials processing.  The electrophoresis of very long chain                  
              polymers such as megabase length DNA is still not well understood.             
              There are still many unexplained experimental effects that greatly             
              reduce the efficacy of this technique.  These effects will be                  
              explored theoretically in consultation with experimentalists.  A               
              newly developed long range Monte Carlo algorithm will be used and              
              will include the effects of gel heterogeneity and intra-chain                  
              repulsion.  Work will also be undertaken on the effect of polymers             
              on turbulent flow by extending an analytical treatment developed by            
              the principal investigator to more realistic descriptions of the               
              velocity field.  Research will also be conducted on novel random               
              matrix ensembles and their connection with the quantum statistical             
              properties of isolated systems.                                                
              %%%                                                                            
              Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis is an experimental technique used             
              to separate DNA molecules containing up to two million base pairs.             
              This discovery was a critical factor in making the human genome                
              project possible.  DNA can be viewed as a polymer and the                      
              methodology of polymer science can be applied to studies of the                
              behavior of DNA in an electric field.  The present grant will                  
              continue fundamental and critical studies on theoretical and                   
              computational aspects of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis.  Such               
              studies help in interpreting the experimental results and in                   
              predicting useful behavior of this important technique.
