Abstract    :
              This planning grant will allow the Principal Investigator to                   
              develop a research proposal for a program in ultrahigh vacuum                  
              scanning tunneling microscopy.  The research areas of interest are             
              surface modification on a nanometer scale, magnetic force                      
              microscopy of thin magnetic films, and the structural and                      
              electronic properties of semiconductor surfaces.
