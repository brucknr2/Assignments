Abstract    :
                   The project investigates the phenomenon of how juveniles                  
              influence their parents into providing them with more, that is,                
              more time (in the family group), more care and attention                       
              (especially from the mother and socialization with other group                 
              members), more protection (from the aggression from the father                 
              and the threat of predators), and more food (nursing from the                  
              mother and male's allowance of young to feed within his area of                
              preferred forage).  The investigation is also trying to assess                 
              the benefits (longer life, greater reproduction, etc.) of this                 
              parental manipulation for the juveniles.  Study animal: the                    
              South American guanaco (Lama guanicoe) in Torres del Paine                     
              National Park on the Patagonia of southern Chile.
