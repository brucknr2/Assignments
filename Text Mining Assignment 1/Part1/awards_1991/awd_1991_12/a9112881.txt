Abstract    :
                   A user mode research program will be carried out                          
              principally in electromagnetic nuclear physics.  Research will                 
              be carried out at the TRIUMF lab in Canada.  The activities                    
              will include:  study of (1) pion bremsstrahlung, radiative                     
              capture, and form factor; (2) di-lepton production in nucleon-                 
              nucleon collisions; and (3) di-lepton production following                     
              pion capture on the proton.  These activities relate to                        
              improved understanding of the structure of pions and nucleon                   
              resonances, with some application to the fundamental                           
              interactions of nucleons in relativistic heavy ion reactions.                  
              Experiment development, simulations, data analysis,                            
              interpretation, and related activities will be carried out at
