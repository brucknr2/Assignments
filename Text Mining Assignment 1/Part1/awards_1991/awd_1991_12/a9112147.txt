Abstract    :
                  A line start disc centrifuge particle size analyzer and                    
              specular reflectance cell to support research in ceramic                       
              engineering will be purchased.  The specular reflectance cell                  
              enhances the capabilities of the particle sizer by providing                   
              critical optical data that corrects for light scattering effects.              
                   This equipment will be used for several research projects that            
              require rapid particle size measurement of submicron powders,                  
              including in particular; research examining the effects of the                 
              light scattering corrections on accuracy of the particle size                  
              analyzer, development of ceramic particle size analysis procedures             
              suitable for this method of analysis, creation of a data-base for              
              commercial and synthetic ceramic powders and developing a                      
              fundamental understanding of how these synthesis methods can be                
              used to control particle size.
