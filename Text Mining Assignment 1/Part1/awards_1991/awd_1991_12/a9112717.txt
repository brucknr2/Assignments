Abstract    :
              This research explores sensor-based control of a mechanical snake              
              through development of obstacle-avoidance and motion-planning                  
              algorithms.  The mechanical snake is robot-like mechanism, a                   
              prototype of which is now being tested in the laboratory.  It                  
              consists of a sensorized head link (that detects obstacles) and                
              six identical regular links (that provide motion).  As an                      
              obstacle is detected, the computer in the head link will be able               
              to recommend a motion of each link so that when that link arrives              
              in the neighborhood of the obstacle it will not collide with it.               
              Developing the algorithms to make this system work is a far more               
              challenging problem than the state-of-the-art, real-time                       
              collision avoidance strategies currently in use for mobile robots              
              and robot arms.  When completed, the snake will be able to move                
              into areas that people cannot enter (e.g., small cracks in                     
              collapsed highway after an earthquake) or are too dangerous for                
              people (e.g., a radioactive environment).  At these locations,                 
              the will perform surveillance (e.g., look for survivors through                
              remote video, check radioactivity levels) or a task (e.g., bring               
              medicine to survivors).
