Abstract    :
              This is the first-year funding of a 3-year continuing award.                   
              Although chess computers now are competitive at master and                     
              grandmaster levels, that is where their resemblance to human                   
              players ends.  Psychological evidence indicates that human chess               
              players search very few positions, and base their positional                   
              assessments on structural/perceptual patterns learned through                  
              experience.  Morph is a computer chess program that has been                   
              developed to be more consistent with the cognitive models.  The                
              learning mechanism combines weight-updating, genetic,                          
              explanation-based and temporal-difference learning to create,                  
              delete, generalize and evaluate graph patterns.  An associative                
              pattern retrieval system organizes the database for efficient                  
              processing.  The main objective of the project are to demonstrate              
              capacity of the system to learn, to deepen our understanding of                
              the interaction of knowledge and search, and to build bridges in               
              this area between AI and cognitive science.  To strengthen the                 
              connections with the cognitive literature the system's knowledge               
              is to come from its own playing experience, no sets of pre-                    
              classified examples are given and beyond its chess pattern                     
              representation scheme little chess knowledge such as the fact                  
              that having pieces is valuable (leave alone their values) has                  
              been provided to the system.  Further, the system is limited to                
              using only 1-ply of search.
