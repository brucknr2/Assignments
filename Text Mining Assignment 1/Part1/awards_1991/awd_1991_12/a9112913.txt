Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Dissociated cultures of neurons obtained from various rat brain                
              regions will be employed to study the effects of the newly                     
              discovered neurotrophic factors, brain derived neurotrophic                    
              factor (BDNF), neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) and leukemia inhibitory                   
              factor (LIF) on cholinergic and dopaminergic biochemical                       
              differentiation.  Observed effects will be compared to those of                
              nerve growth factor (NGF).  In vivo experiments in which the                   
              neurotrophic factors are injected into specific brain areas will               
              be done to determine whether the effects observed in culture are               
              biologically relevant.
