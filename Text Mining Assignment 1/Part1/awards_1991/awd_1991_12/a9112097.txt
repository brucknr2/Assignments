Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Dr. Ulibarri will use the support provided from the Minority              
              Research Initiation Planning Grant to obtain necessary pilot data              
              to prepare a competitive research proposal.  The aim of her                    
              research is to understand how gonadal hormones influence the                   
              development of a group of sexually dimorphic motoneurons in the                
              spinal cord.  These motoneurons provide an excellent model for                 
              examining the cellular mechanisms of action of gonadal hormones.               
              Dr. Ulibarri will use state-of-the-art anatomical techniques to                
              initially define the neurogenesis of motoneurons in males and                  
              females.  These data are important to formulate hypotheses                     
              concerning migration and differentiation of these developing                   
              neurons.   She will then determine how gonadal steroids affect                 
              the development of these motoneurons.  This research should                    
              ultimately lead to new insights about how hormones regulate the                
              production, migration and/or survival of neurons within this                   
              sexually dimorphic system and advance our understanding of the                 
              cellular events underlying the plasticity of the nervous system.
