Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award supports acquisition of a dilution refrigerator,                    
              dedicated to research in physics and engineering on the topics of              
              quantum transport, point contacts, Coulomb blockade, millimeter                
              wave radio-astronomy receivers and x-ray detectors.  These programs            
              are included in the Yale Center for Microelectronic Materials and              
              Structures, which would house the dilution refrigerator.
