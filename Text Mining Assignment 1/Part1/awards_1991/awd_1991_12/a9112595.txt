Abstract    :
                   Professor King will study a number of questions in ergodic                
              theory.  He will consider potential generalizations of a                       
              structure theorem based on joinings.  He will investigate the                  
              "continuous selection problem", related to work of Oxtoby and                  
              Ulam.  He will study two combinatorial problems: the 2-fold 3-                 
              fold mixing problem and the van den Berg-Kesten "box conjecture".              
                   This project involves research in ergodic theory.  Ergodic                
              theory in general concerns understanding the average behavior of               
              systems whose dynamics is too complicated or chaotic to be                     
              followed in microscopic detail.  Under the heading "dynamics" can              
              be placed the modern theory of how groups of abstract                          
              transformations act on smooth spaces.  In this way ergodic theory              
              makes contact with geometry in its quest to classify flows on                  
              homogeneous spaces.
