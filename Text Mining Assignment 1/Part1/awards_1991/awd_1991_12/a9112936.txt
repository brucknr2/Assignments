Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project addresses a major and important puzzle with                       
              implications for our understanding of U.S. manufacturing                       
              productivity.  The results should also enhance our understanding               
              of the determinants of economic fluctuations in output.  The                   
              puzzle is the idleness of capital much of the time in U.S.                     
              manufacturing.  Specifically, the workweek of capital in U.S.                  
              manufacturing averages only 55 hours per week.  If a unit of                   
              capital does not get less productive with more intensive use over              
              time and if its user cost is independent of the rate of                        
              utilization, then the productivity of the capital stock in U.S.                
              manufacturing could be three times higher simply by increasing                 
              the utilization of the existing capital stock.  The idleness of                
              capital also implies that even at cyclical peaks, tight capacity               
              does not limit the expansion of the economy.                                   
                                                                                             
              This project investigates the costs of increasing the workweek of              
              capital along several dimensions.  It determines whether these                 
              costs justify the low utilization of capital.  The estimates of                
              the cost of using capital more intensively are based on a study                
              of the U.S. economy during World War II.  The private U.S.                     
              economy during World War II produced a tremendous increment in                 
              output with little increase in capacity.  This project assembles               
              and analyzes data on shift work, female labor participation, on                
              work hours and conditions for production works and on other labor              
              arrangements during World War II from the records of the price                 
              control board, the military procurement agencies and private                   
              companies.
