Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Foreign competition is having a considerable impact on the                     
              competitiveness of salmonid pen.culture ventures in the US. One                
              means to increase the economic viability of US ventures is to                  
              rear additional species with clear.cut commercial potential.                   
              Lumpfish are a possible candidate for net.pen culture for their                
              roe (caviar) and flesh.  Lumpfish were grown in net.pens, spawned              
              and initial attempts at larval rearing begun with a Phase I SBIR.              
              Further research on the suitability of lumpfish for net.pen                    
              culture will be determined during the Phase II SBIR by seeking                 
              answers to the following questions: 1) Can larval lumpfish be                  
              reared with satisfactory growth and survival on artificial diets?              
              2) Can adults survive, grow and produce normal eggs when held in               
              net.pens at salmon densities? 3) Are non.spawning lumpfish held                
              year.round in net.pens, a quality foodfish?
