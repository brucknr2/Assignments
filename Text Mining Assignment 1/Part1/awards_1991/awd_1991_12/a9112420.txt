Abstract    :
                 Increased concern about global environmental change has focused             
              attention on the need to identify critical variables that can be used to       
              monitor shifts in the world's climate and other physical conditions.           
              Among the variables that scientists believe will provide accurate,             
              easily updated indices of changing conditions are measurements of the          
              extent and duration of seasonal snow cover and of the amounts of ice           
              within glaciers and ice caps.  This project will gather data on these          
              variables from a number of published sources in both the U.S. and              
              U.S.S.R.  Remotely sensed data also will be gathered.  Preliminary             
              analyses will be undertaken to ascertain how these cryospheric variables       
              correlate with other climatic, topographic, and land-characteristic            
              variables.  This research will be conducted collaboratively between            
              scientists at the University of Colorado-Boulder and the Institute of          
              Geography of the Academy of Sciences of the U.S.S.R.                           
                 This project will bring together data about snow cover and  glacial         
              fluctuations in addition to other related variables.  These data will          
              provide valuable new information with which to test hypotheses about the       
              degree to which cryospheric variables may be used as indices of global         
              environmental change.  The project also will provide tests of new means        
              of gathering data using remote sensors, and it will foster greater             
              collaboration between American and Soviet scientists with common               
              research interests.
