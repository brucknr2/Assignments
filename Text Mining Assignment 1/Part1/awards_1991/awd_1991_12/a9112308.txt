Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project investigates the effects of a severe arctic storm                 
              on community structure and evolution of the mussel, Mytilus                   
              califonianus. The storm descended on the Pacific Northwest in                 
              late December 1990 and resulted in atypical freezing weather in                
              the intertidal zone inhabited by the mussels. Such events                      
              probably occur about once in every twenty five years although                  
              there is some evidence of an increase. The mussels were severely               
              affected by the freeze, and large mortalities were observed.                   
              However, mortality appears to be non.random. Mussels with other                
              organisms living on and with them, such as barnacles and algae,                
              did not die as often as mussels without associated organisms.                  
              This project will document mortality through field collections,                
              and carry out genetic analysis (by the technique of                            
              electrophoresis) of survivors and of dead individuals. The                     
              results will determine whether genetic and phenotypic changes in               
              the mussel populations will accompany community wide changes, and              
              hence whether evolutionary changes will occur.
