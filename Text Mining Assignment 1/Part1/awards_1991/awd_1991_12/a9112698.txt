Abstract    :
                   Peroxides occur in atmospheric rain, fog and snow samples in              
              concentrations as high as several hundred micromolar.  In                      
              addition to its deleterious effects on human health and plant                  
              growth, hydrogen peroxide is generally believed to be the                      
              principal oxidant for sulfur dioxide in the Northeastern United                
              States, resulting in enhanced acidity of cloudwater.  Recent work              
              has shown that organic peroxides oxidize sulfur dioxide at rates               
              comparable to that of hydrogen peroxide, and some field                        
              measurements suggest that organic and hydrogen peroxides may                   
              occur in the atmosphere in similar concentrations.  In spite of                
              their importance, we are not certain what fraction of total                    
              atmospheric peroxides are organic, nor do we have a complete                   
              understanding of the processes which produce and destroy them.                 
              This grant supports laboratory and field studies aimed at a                    
              better understanding of peroxide occurrence and chemistry.  Using              
              a newly developed technique, we will analyze precipitation                     
              samples for organic and hydrogen peroxide.
