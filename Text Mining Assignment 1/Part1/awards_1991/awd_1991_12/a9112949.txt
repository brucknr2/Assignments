Abstract    :
                   Professor Yau will study several fundamental problems in                  
              complex geometry including solutions to the complex Plateau                    
              problem and the embedding problem for three dimensional CR                     
              manifolds. He will also try to extend previous work on finite                  
              dimensional Lie algebras and isolated hypersurface singularities               
              to higher codimension singularities.                                           
                   This award will support research in three basic areas of                  
              complex differential geometry. The complex Plateau problem is a                
              geometric minimization problem. The goal of the proposed research              
              is to classify those real odd-dimensional real submanifolds which              
              are boundaries of complex manifolds. This work is closely                      
              connected to research on CR manifolds - spaces which usually                   
              occur as subspaces of complex space. Although most of the work                 
              which will be supported by this proposal falls into the area of                
              what has been called "pure mathematics", much of Professor Yau's               
              work in this field has found application in control theory and                 
              filtering. The work thus serves as a reminder of the link between              
              basic research and application.
