Abstract    :
                   The James Entomological Collection at Washington State                    
              University is one of the largest University collections of insects             
              in the country.  The Collection is representative in all major                 
              groups of insect orders and contains approximately 1.25 million                
              specimens.  It is especially strong in Diptera (flies), Coleoptera             
              (beetles), Lepidoptera (moth and butterflies), Hemiptera (bugs),               
              and Hymenoptera (bees and wasps) and maintains a collection of type            
              material.  Begun in 1892, the holdings of the Collection are of                
              significant historical as well as scientific importance.  It is one            
              of the few collections which can provide specimens from the Pacific            
              Northwest and thus serves as an important regional and national                
              resource.                                                                      
                                                                                             
                   The Collection has moved to new facilities (December 1992)                
              which were actually designed as a collection room with adjoining               
              offices and library.  The addition of new drawers , cabinets, and              
              pinning trays, will provide adequate housing for specimens which               
              are now stored in substandard housing.  Funding also allows us to              
              house our material in a single style of drawer (USNM) for the first            
              time in the history of the Collection and, because of the                      
              efficiency of the new drawers, eliminates the problems of on going             
              pest infestations and the constant need for fumigants.  The                    
              addition of technical help allows for the transfer of specimens                
              form the old housing to the new with only a minimum disruption to              
              the day-to-day activities of the Collection.  Washington State                 
              University agrees to fund 30% of equipment (housing) costs.
