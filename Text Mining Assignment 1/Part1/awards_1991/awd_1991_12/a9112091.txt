Abstract    :
              This project is an equipment grant                                             
              request for upgrading the existing                                             
              universal panel testing machine at                                             
              the University of Houston for use in                                           
              the study of the earthquake                                                    
              resistance of reinforced concrete                                              
              walls and the utilization of high-                                             
              performance concrete in wall-type                                              
              and shell-type structures.  In these                                           
              types of testing (including cyclic                                             
              loadings), a servo control system to                                           
              control the strain or deformation of                                           
              the specimen is required.  Funds                                               
              will be needed for the purchase and                                            
              installation of such an automated                                              
              servo control systems.                                                         
                                                                                             
              When upgraded, this universal panel                                            
              tester will become one of the most                                             
              versatile in the world and will open                                           
              up new areas for research on                                                   
              specimens subjected to complex                                                 
              stress states.  In addition to                                                 
              reinforced concrete, the universal                                             
              panel tester can also be used to                                               
              test panels made of steel, aluminum,                                           
              wood or other composite materials.
