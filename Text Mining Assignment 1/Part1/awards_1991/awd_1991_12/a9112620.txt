Abstract    :
                   In plant species with chromosomal sex determination, one                  
              would expect the ratio of males and females to be 1:1.  To                     
              characterize fully the significance of a known unbalanced                      
              populationsex ratio, processes which cause the bias are of                     
              primary interest, not only in terms of explaining a population                 
              condition, but elucidating fundamental differences in the                      
              selective pressures affecting the different sexes.  A series of                
              experiments to study mechanisms affecting the sex ratio of the                 
              dioecious perennial Silene latifolia (Caryophyllaceae) are                     
              proposed.  The proposal will address a set of main factors                     
              potentially responsible for the initiation and  maintenance of a               
              sex ratio bias: discrepancies between numbers of X- and Y-                     
              containingpollen in males, death of XY or XX zygotes,                          
              differentialsurvivorship within the seed bank, and sex specific                
              mortality schedules.  The experiments described will provide                   
              valuable information on when males and females experience                      
              divergent selection pressures.  This knowledge, in turn, will                  
              help us address the ecological and evolutionary significance of                
              such biases.
