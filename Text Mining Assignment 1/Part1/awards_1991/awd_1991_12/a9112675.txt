Abstract    :
                     Within the domain of ecological studies of species                      
              interactions, those involving insects and birds are relatively                 
              more common while those dealing with volant mammals, bats, are                 
              relatively less frequently encountered.  But there are 250                     
              species of bats that pollinate and disperse the seeds of more                  
              than 130 plant genera, many of which are of substantial economic               
              significance.  Such studies have centered on individual bat                    
              species and a limited number of plant species rather than on a                 
              guild or community of bat species or a suite of plant species.                 
              Attention has been focused almost exclusively on the Neotropics,               
              with very little study devoted to fruit bats of the Old World                  
              tropics; these two groups have undergone independent evolution                 
              toward frugivorous and nectarivorous feeding modes, and thus may               
              differ significantly in their ecologies.                                       
                     A two year field study of fruit bat ecology in northeast                
              India (the Tista valley in Sikkim), focusing on community level                
              interactions and effects on plant reproductive success via                     
              pollination and seed dispersal, and the roles of other                         
              pollinators and dispersers (birds, moths, ants), will be                       
              undertaken.  Differences between phytophagous bats of the Old                  
              World and New World, in terms of dispersal abilities and                       
              nutritional needs, will be investigated.  A study of the                       
              potentially highly-coevolved relationship between the bat                      
              Eonycteris spelaea, as pollinator of a plant (Oroxylum), is                    
              planned.  The conservation implications of these interactions                  
              will be studied, as will the role of these fruit bats as pests of              
              commercial fruit production.
