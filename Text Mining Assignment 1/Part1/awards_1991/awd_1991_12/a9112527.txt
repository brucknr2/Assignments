Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The purpose of this project is to use newly available within-firm              
              personnel data, including longitudinal employee records, to study              
              internal labor markets over the business cycle.  Statistical                   
              patterns in real wages over the business cycle and knowledgeable               
              observers' descriptions of employer practices suggest that                     
              cyclical variation in firms' hiring standards and promotion rates              
              play a key role in aggregate employment and wage fluctuations.                 
              This aspect of the business cycle, however, has never been                     
              subjected to quantitative study because of the general                         
              unavailability of within-firm data.                                            
                                                                                             
              This project uses personnel records recently acquired from the                 
              Ford Motor Company, the Pullman Company, and the A.M. Byers                    
              Company to peer inside the "black box" of the internal labor                   
              market.  This unique opportunity to track individual workers'                  
              wages and job assignments within the firm and relate them to                   
              conditions in the aggregate labor market will shed new light on                
              both the nature of cyclical labor market fluctuations and the                  
              nature of the employment relationship.
