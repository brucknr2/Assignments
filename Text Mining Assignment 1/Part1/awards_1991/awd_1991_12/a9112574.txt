Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposed research aims at fabricating tailored microstructure             
              ferroelectric and superconducting thin films on semiconductors                 
              substrates with and without buffer layers, and developing a                    
              thorough understanding of the structure-property correlations in               
              ferroelectric and superconducting films.  This will be achieved by             
              controlled and systematic variation in the microstructure of the               
              ferroelectric films on semiconductors and on epitaxial buffer                  
              layers on semiconductors.  To facilitate the tailoring of the                  
              microstructure, buffer layers will be deposited which act as                   
              diffusion barriers and provide good thermal matching between the               
              film and the substrate.  This approach will be also used to deposit            
              crack-free superconducting thin films and related superlattice                 
              structures on semiconductor substrates.

              This research will provide tailored processing of ferroelectric                
              films to obtain the desired electrical properties.  Ferroelectric              
              thin films on semiconductors are important electronic devices such             
              as non-volatile memories.  This research will also lead to the                 
              fabrication of crack-free epitaxial superconducting films and                  
              related structures on semiconductor substrates.  This study aims to            
              develop a thorough understanding of the structure-property                     
              relationships in these films.
