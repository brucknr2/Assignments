Abstract    :
              Under an Engineering Research Equipment Grant, a wave                          
              generator and necessary controls will be added to an existing                  
              experimental capability which produces droplets in a stream of                 
                                                                                             
              much greater uniformity in size and speed than previously                      
              attainable.  The new spray formation technique depends on the                  
              achievement of a precisely controlled time dependent                           
              fluctuation pressure near the spray nozzle exit.                               
              The utility of the controlled droplet stream is in the                         
              manufacture of net form high quality precision components,                     
              whit molten metal droplets deposited and rapidly solidified to                 
                                                                                             
              form the final shape.
