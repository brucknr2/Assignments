Abstract    :
              A Fourier-transform infrared spectrometer is acquired to                       
              support research in engineering.  The instrument is to be used                 
              in conjunction with existing ultrahigh-vacuum systems for                      
              infrared reflection-absorption spectroscopy (IRAS).                            
              Initially, it is used to study adsorbates on well-defined,                     
              single-crystal, metal-oxide surfaces and to probe the local                    
              site requirements for adsorption and catalytic reactions on                    
              such surfaces.  Specific systems under investigation include                   
              simple molecules on  cuprous oxide, and a variety of                           
              oxidations over cuprous oxide, stannic oxide, and chromous                     
              oxide.                                                                         
                                                                                             
              Potential applications from these efforts exist in commodity                   
              chemicals, specialty chemicals, electronic materials, and                      
              pollution control.
