Abstract    :
              A diffuse reflectance accessory for Fourier-transform infrared                  
                                                                                            
              spectroscopy is acquired for use with a demonstration                          
              instrument supplied by Nicolet Instruments.  This is used to                   
              study mechanisms in heterogeneous catalytic systems.  Systems                  
              to be studied include methanol-to-gasoline (MTG) on ZSM-5,                     
              studies of zeolite acidity, oligomerization of olefins in                      
              zeolites, and methanol synthesis over copper/zinc oxide.                       
                                                                                             
              All of these systems are of current importance industrially. //
