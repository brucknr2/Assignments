Abstract    :
              The Supreme Court is at the top of the federal judicial hierarchy,             
              but hierarchy does not necessarily imply control.  If the Supreme              
              Court is in fact to be supreme in its impact, normative legal                  
              theory posits that inferior courts must follow judicial policy as              
              determined by the Supreme Court.  Alternatively, principal-agent               
              theory suggests that there will be times when agents (e.g., Circuit            
              Courts) will shirk this responsibility and represent their own                 
              interests rather than the interests of their principals (e.g., the             
              Supreme Court).  Despite the importance of understanding court                 
              interaction, research on the topic has been quite limited and                  
              attention to a principal-agent perspective virtually non-existent.             
                                                                                             
              The theoretical and empirical work being undertaken by Dr. Segal               
              represents a valuable step forward.  Using principal-agent theory,             
              he plans to investigate the degree to which the circuit courts                 
              carry out Supreme Court policy versus the degree to which they                 
              substitute their own self-interest.  Specifically, the study will              
              focus on search and seizure cases from 1962 through 1990 and                   
              examine both the following of precedent by circuit courts and the              
              reviewing of circuit court decisions to correct them by the Supreme            
              Court.  Too little is known about the processes by which Supreme               
              Court decisions affect lower appellate court judges.  This study               
              will contribute substantially to our understanding of this                     
              interaction and thus to our knowledge of the adminstration of                  
              justice in society.
