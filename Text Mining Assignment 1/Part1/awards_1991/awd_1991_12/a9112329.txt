Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project is an experimental approach to the investigation of a             
              high mobility electron gas which involves application of advanced              
              spectroscopic techniques for high temporal and spatial resolution.             
              Optical methods will be employed to complement transport                       
              measurements and to initiate new directions in the study of                    
              collective and ballistic phenomena, including the presence of a                
              quantizing magnetic field.
