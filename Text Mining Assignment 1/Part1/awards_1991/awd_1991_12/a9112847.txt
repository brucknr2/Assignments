Abstract    :
                   A multi-disciplinary project for modeling clastic                         
              sedimentation occurring in basins over geologic time scales is                 
              planned.  The model includes the dynamic deposition and                        
              entrainment of sediments in an arbitrary three-dimensional                     
              region.  The governing equations are the full three-dimensional                
              Navier-Stokes equations coupled with a parabolic transport                     
              equation for each species of sediment.  The computational domain               
              is composed of two free surfaces, an air-water interface and a                 
              water bed interface, as well as artificially imposed boundaries                
              that limit computation to the region of interest.  Among the                   
              computation difficults are handling of the free surfaces, the                  
              very large geologic time scales, and the treatment of turbulence.              
              The complexity of the system necessitates development of parallel              
              algorithms for the solution of the model equations.                            
                   The research team includes Professors M.J. Wheeler and                    
              B.Ramaswamy of Rice University and Professor R. Glowinski of the               
              University of Houston and hydrologists from Texaco Corporation.
