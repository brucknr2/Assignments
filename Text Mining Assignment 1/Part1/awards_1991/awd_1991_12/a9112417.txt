Abstract    :
                     Treeless parks dominated by sagebrush or grasses and herbs              
              are a conspicuous feature of the montane and subalpine vegetation              
              zones in the central Rocky Mountains.  Carbon-dated pollen                     
              records taken from cores of pond sediments can be used to                      
              reconstruct the vegetation history of a site or region.  The area              
              around Fish Creek Park in the Wind River Mountains of Wyoming                  
              will be studied in this way to determine the pattern of spatial                
              and temporal vegetation change.  An effort to reconstruct the                  
              vegetation history of the Taylor Park, Colorado area might also                
              be warranted, depending upon preliminary findings.                             
                     Information about the age and spatial stability of the                  
              landscape will be used to test three hypotheses of park origin;                
              these hypotheses (which involve persistence, remnants, and                     
              natural fire regimes) have been invoked to explain the existence               
              of parks, but have never been tested.  Further study of findings               
              might be extended to explain the origins of other parks in the                 
              region.  The timing and sequence of vegetation change that                     
              accompanies park formation will suggest new hypotheses related                 
              to specific mechanisms responsible for park establishment and                  
              maintenance.
