Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The main goal of this project is to study how students                    
              learn abstract mathematics.  The specific situation to be                      
              studied is how students increase their level of                                
              sophistication in mathematics so that they can understand                      
              abstract algebra at the undergraduate level.  In addition,                     
              since abstract algebra is a basic course for teachers, it                      
              has influence on the education of teachers and how they                        
              learn, and whence, how they teach mathematics in the                           
              schools.                                                                       
                                                                                             
                   The design of the research study will include the study                   
              of "traditional" approach to teaching this course and a                        
              pedagogical approach that involves the use of computers to                     
              initially construct the abstract objects that occur in an                      
              abstract algebra course combined with a cooperative learning                   
              environment.  This study will be carried out at a number of                    
              universities and by several faculty members at those                           
              universities.                                                                  
                                                                                             
                   There will be a faculty workshop and minicourses given                    
              at professional meetings to disseminate the findings of this                   
              research and the techniques developed to help in learning                      
              abstract concepts.
