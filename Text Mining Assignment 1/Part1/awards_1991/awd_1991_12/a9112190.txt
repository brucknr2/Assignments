Abstract    :
              There exists a need for large scale liposome manufacturing                     
              processes which can meet the growing market demand for                         
              liposomal drug delivery and controlled release vehicles                        
              with the constraints of stability, sterility, and cost.                        
              Bio-Eng is developing a large-scale liposome manufacturing                     
              process which has the potential to improve liposome                            
              characteristics and encapsulation efficiencies while                           
              meeting the market needs of the biotechnology and                              
              pharmaceutical industries. In the Bio-Eng critical fluid                       
              liposome (CFL) manufacturing process, organic solvents                         
              used in the preparation of liposomes are replaced with                         
              critical fluid solvents which, as a result of                                  
              decompressive forces, can act as a homogenizing agent.                         
                                                                                             
              The displacement of organic solvents with critical fluid                       
              solvents in the liposome manufacturing process will reduce                     
              the degradation of phospholipids and encapsulated                              
              therapeutics, and allow rapid solvent separation,                              
              recovery, and reuse.  There are several potential benefits                     
              to the proposed processes over existing laboratory and                         
              commercial processes for the preparation of liposomes.                         
              The anticipated benefits are: non-use of organic solvents;                     
              terminal sterilization of the manufactured liposomes; an                       
              oxygen free atmosphere; lower pressure requirements when                       
              compared to high pressure homogenation; lower operating                        
              and manufacturing costs; higher speed of processing; the                       
              potential formation of uniform frozen and thawed critical                      
              fluid liposomes; the ability to operate continuously; and                      
              scalability.
