Abstract    :
              This group of investigators proposes to purchase an electron                   
              microscope and a confocal light microscope.  The electron                      
              microscope will be used particularly for the study of frozen                   
              hydrated viruses and related specimens.  The confocal microscope               
              will be used in the study of cell substructure.
