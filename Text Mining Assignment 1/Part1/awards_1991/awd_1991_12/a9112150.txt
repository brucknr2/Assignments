Abstract    :
                   The research supported by this award will investigate an                  
              approach to a conformal mapping theorem for non-Riemannian metrics.            
              The principal investigator will try to extend the method of circle             
              packing which was used to give a proof of the standard Riemann                 
              mapping theorem. He will also undertake a study of infinite circle             
              packings and try to describe the relationship between the shape of             
              an infinite circle packing with prescribed combinatorics and the               
              rigidity of such a structure.                                                  
                   This research is an extension of the classical theorem which              
              says that a simply connected two dimensional domain, one without               
              holes, is equivalent in a very precise way to a disk, a plane or a             
              sphere. A method of proving this theorem involving a packing of the            
              domain by circles was discovered several years ago. This research              
              involves questions raised by this new proof. The theorem itself is             
              used in a very crucial way in computing flow over airfoils and the             
              recently discovered proof opens up new possibilities for more                  
              efficient computations of flows.
