Abstract    :
                   An integral component of the multi-agency U.S. Global Change              
              Research Program (Our Changing Planet," Committee on Earth                     
              Sciences, 1991) is understanding and modeling the geospace                     
              environment.  As part of its contribution to the U.S. Global                   
              Change  Research Program, the National Science Foundation's                    
              Division of Atmospheric Sciences has established a new research                
              initiative,  Geospace Environment Modeling (GEM), with the goal                
              of supporting basic research into the dynamical and structural                 
              properties of geospace, leading to the construction of a global                
              geospace model with predictive capability.                                     
                   The subjects of the first GEM campaign are the                            
              magnetospheric boundary, the magnetosheath beyond it, and the                  
              connection from the boundary through the magnetosphere to the                  
              ionosphere.  This grant is concerned with theoretical modeling                 
              of the low latitude boundary layer (LLBL) and its mappings and                 
              electrical coupling to the dayside ionosphere.  The primary                    
              objectives are to advance current understanding of (i) the field               
              line mapping between the LLBL and the ionosphere, and (ii) the                 
              generation and distribution of the dayside region 1 currents and               
              the associated convection and particle precipitation.
