Abstract    :
                   Few studies have examined the ecological factors that shape               
              the social life histories of termites, a taxon important for                   
              comparison with other cooperatively living animals.  The dampwood              
              termite, Zootermopsis nevadensis, is a model organism for                      
              studies on nest-founding, biparental care, foraging and offspring              
              production.  Much of a colony's nesting and feeding activity, up               
              to the 2nd year, can be observed on the log's surface, just under              
              the bark.  These characteristics serve to facilitate studies of                
              the ecological pressures influencing Zootermopsis.                             
                   This study on incipient colonies of Zootermopsis nevadensis               
              will show how limited nitrogen availability, intraspecific                     
              competition, and predation influence 1) mate choice and/or                     
              competition for mates and 2) survivorship of breeding adults,                  
              territory size and offspring production.  3) The advantages of                 
              biparental care under various ecological conditions will also be               
              assessed, by comparing uniparental colonies with biparental                    
              colonies.  An estimated 900 field colonies will be sampled over a              
              one year period.  Experimental manipulations that serve to                     
              increase and decrease potential ecological pressures on colonies,              
              coupled with information obtained from undisturbed colonies under              
              assessed ecological conditions, will provide a comprehensive and               
              quantitative view of the factors hypothesized to be important in               
              the social life history of Zootermopsis.
