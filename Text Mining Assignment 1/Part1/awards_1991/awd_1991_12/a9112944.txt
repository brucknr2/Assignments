Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal requests two year support for the participation of               
              graduate students in the parallel circus meetings which are held               
              twice a year.  It is anticipated that 10 graduate students will                
              attend each meeting and that the attendees will be chosen by a                 
              committee based on the quality of their research.  This will give              
              many graduate students the opportunity to have their research                  
              scrutinized by experts in the field at an early stage of their                 
              career.  This in turn could have a positive impact on research in              
              parallel processing.
