Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This MRI will be used in two ways to prepare a full proposal.                  
              First, the choice of a mass spectrometer, a necessary piece of                 
              equipment, will be investigated. Second, a strong working knowledge            
              of appropriate numerical climate models will be gained by close                
              interaction with personnel at GFDL, Princeton University.
