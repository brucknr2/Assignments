Abstract    :
              New HPLC and CZE equipment will provide not only a base                        
              from which the Principal Investigators (PIs) will develop                      
              new separation techniques, but also essential analytical                       
              tools to cross-check and monitor and corroborate                               
              theoretical advances.  Four separation techniques will be                      
              studied: capillary zone electrophoresis, supercritical                         
              fluid-based processes, analytical chromatography, and                          
              displacement chromatography.  The requested HPLC and CZE                       
              equipment will be used in these projects for analytical                        
              work and for collection of physico-chemical data required                      
              in simulation and design of the various processes.  They                       
              will also be used, sometimes with modifications, to                            
              explore novel techniques to be developed for the                               
              enhancement of the efficiency of both liquid                                   
              chromatography and CZE in bioprocess applications.
