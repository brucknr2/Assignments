Abstract    :
              The proposed research will explore the application of newly                    
              available morphometric methods to phylogenetically significant                 
              complex characters in plants.  These methods rely both on landmark             
              and outline data used in, for instance, thin plate spline,                     
              resistant fit, and eigenshape analyses, as well as on the fractal              
              geometry of strange attractors.  The characters examined as models             
              are seed shape and testa patterns in Orchidaceae.  These characters            
              appear to have systematic significance, but quantification is                  
              essential to objective analysis.  The characters have the potential            
              to resolve difficult phylogenetic questions, as do similar                     
              characters in many botanical taxa, but without a quantitative                  
              methodology allowing them to be utilized consistently, their                   
              potential remains unrealized.  New techniques will be evaluated in             
              the context of more traditional characters already available as                
              part of ongoing studies.
