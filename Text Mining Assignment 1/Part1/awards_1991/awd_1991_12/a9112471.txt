Abstract    :
                   This project will study solutions to elliptic equations                   
              derived from multiple integrals with symmetries.  The topics to                
              be emphasized are estimates up to the boundary, global                         
              regularity, isolated and removable singularities, apriori                      
              gradient estimates, and the relation between quasiconvexity and                
              rank one convexity.                                                            
                   The equations to be studied model phenomena in geometry,                  
              optimal design and nonlinear elasticity.  Thus this project has                
              applications in various branches of mathematics and engineering.
