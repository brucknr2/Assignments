Abstract    :
              Under this grant, Dr. Shrader-Frechette is examining three                     
              methodological issues that are central to community ecology or                 
              population biology.  (1)  Are explanations in community ecology                
              particular, as many biologists have claimed?  (2) Are there                    
              empirical laws or laws of nature in community ecology?  (3)  Are               
              there individually testable hypotheses, including null hypotheses,             
              in community ecology?  After evaluating these three methodological             
              questions in terms of the arguments and examples that ecologists               
              on various sides of the issues have employed, Dr. Shrader-Frechette            
              will attempt to draw two sets of conclusions.  One set concerns the            
              nature of scientific explanation in ecology.  The other set of                 
              conclusions concerns what, if anything, the status of law and                  
              explanation in community ecology might reveal about scientific law             
              and explanation in general.  This project promises to contribute               
              to the on-going debates about whether the alleged explanations and             
              laws of ecology are like those of the physical sciences; what is               
              the empirical status of alleged ecological laws; what is the scope             
              of realistic hopes for improving he "scientific" status of ecology;            
              whether, and if so, in what sense, ecology is a science; and what              
              the nature of explanation and law in ecology reveals about                     
              scientific law and explanation in general.
