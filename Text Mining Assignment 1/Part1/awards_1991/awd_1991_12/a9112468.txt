Abstract    :
              A Silicon Graphics workstation is requested to create a local                  
              supercomputing environment dedicated to the computational                      
              research programs in fluid dynamics, combustion, surface                       
              science and catalysis, and polymer science.  It will provide                   
              the essential computing and graphics power for studies such as                 
              modeling of turbulent combustion, simulation of blood flow in                  
              artificial hearts, modeling of geometrical effects in                          
              capillary systems, and Monte Carlo simulations of surface                      
              diffusion in adsorption and polymeric systems.  At the same                    
              time, its advanced 3D capabilities will allow real time                        
              visualization of inherently multidimensional numerical results                 
              obtained from these studies.                                                   
                                                                                             
              The combination of powerful analysis and graphics performance                  
              in this system will improve the quality and broaden the scope                  
              of numerical simulations by allowing continuous graphical                      
              interaction between the researchers and their applications.                    
              Moreover, this workstation is an invaluable tool for parallel                  
              algorithm development, and will be used to teach students to                   
              make effective use of parallel computing in research.
