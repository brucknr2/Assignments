Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Department of Materials Science and Engineering at the                     
              University of Cincinnati will purchase a Fourier-transform                     
              Raman spectrometer which will be dedicated to support research                 
              in engineering.  The equipment will be used for several                        
              research projects, including use of surface-enhanced Raman                     
              scattering (SERS) for investigating the adsorption of block                    
              copolymers onto metal substrates, the non-destructive                          
              determination of the molecular structure of interphase between                 
              polymer systems such as polyimides and anaerobic acrylic                       
              adhesives and metal substrates such as copper and gold,                        
              changes that occur in the molecular structure of the                           
              polyimides matrix in graphite/PMR-15 composites during aging                   
              in air at 316C, waveguiding in polymer films as part of a new                 
              thrust area in advanced photonic materials, studies of the                     
              microstructure of semi-flexible main chain liquid crystalline                  
              polymers, and research on intermediates in chemical vapor                      
              deposition (CVD), a technique that is widely used for the                      
              growth of important thin films and coatings on a range of                      
              substrates.
