Abstract    :
              This NSF Engineering Research Equipment Grant                                  
              will support equipment that will aide in the computer                          
              acquisition of experimental data for the general                               
              problem of nonlinear wave plasma interaction.                                  
              Experiments are performed in the areas of:  1)                                 
              soliton propagation in nonideal plasmas and higher                             
              dimensional soliton effects; 2) nonlinear self similar                         
              effects in plasma physics; 3) wake and jet effects in                          
              plasmas flowing past or through perturbing objects;                            
              and 4) general properties of nonlinear wave                                    
              phenomena.
