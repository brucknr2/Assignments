Abstract    :
                   Indiana University of Pennsylvania requests support from NSF              
              for connection of its campus network to PREPnet.  PREPnet is the               
              midlevel network located in the state of Pennsylvania.  PREPnet                
              will provide operations management and information services and                
              it will give Indiana University of Pennsylvania connection to the              
              NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per second) National               
              Backbone network.                                                              
                   The university needs greater functionality and network speed              
              to be able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file                  
              transfers along with being able to implement a more reliable mail              
              system. Students and faculty research will benefit from the link.              
              This is also a unique opportunity for the school to explore                    
              innovative educational resources.
