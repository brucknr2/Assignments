Abstract    :
              A gamma counter is to be acquired for radio isotope assays                     
              and radioimmuno assays.  Specific research areas in which                      
              this instrument will be used are: i) Development of                            
              low-cost polymeric surfaces for culturing                                      
              anchorage-dependent mammalian cells; ii) Role of plasma                        
              membrane fluidity and cytoskeletal architecture on cell                        
              fragility; and iii) Influence of nutrition and cell                            
              longevity on monoclonal antibody synthesis.
