Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The decades following the US Civil War saw the most creative period            
              of institution building in the history of the House of                         
              Representatives.  This innovative research seeks to draw explicit              
              links between this critical period of congressional history and                
              the contemporary congress.  The institutional practices that                   
              developed during this period, such as the development of the                   
              seniority principle and the development of the differentiated                  
              committee system loom large in the contemporary congress.                      
              Understanding the origins and early dynamics of these institutions             
              can provide insights into the operation of the contemporary house.             
                                                                                             
              Specifically this project provides a comprehensive accounting of               
              organizational change in the House of Representatives from 1870 to             
              1946. Data will be collected on the committee system during the                
              period and will be augmented with data on member characteristics               
              and on the political system more generally.                                    
                                                                                             
              When completed this research not only will shed light on                       
              congressional politics during an important and formative period of             
              American history but also will help us evaluate contemporary                   
              political theories about collective choice.
