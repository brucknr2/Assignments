Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project studies women having at-home and jobs in traditional              
              work places.  Comparisons will be drawn between women occupying                
              the two types, in terms of their attitudes, incomes, division of               
              family and work responsibilities, and movement between the types               
              of jobs.   The investigators will extend and test a theoretical                
              model which leads them to predict that at-home women will hold                 
              more traditional gender role attitudes, receive lower wages and                
              fewer benefits, receive less job training and slower promotion                 
              rates, and spend greater time in child care and other household                
              responsibilities.  Model testing uses data from the National                   
              Longitudinal Surveys of Young and Mature women, the first nat-                 
              ional data set providing information about at-home work.
