Abstract    :
                   This project will consider regularity of solutions to                     
              degenerate elliptic equations, controlled diffusion processes,                 
              and Ito's stochastic equations.  A variety of techniques from                  
              partial differential equations and probability will be utilized.               
              These include barriers, study of boundary operators, and                       
              quasiderivatives.                                                              
                   The results of this project, in addition to furthering our                
              understanding of the nature of solutions to partial differential               
              equations, will have applications to areas such as finance,                    
              population genetics, and control of chemical systems.
