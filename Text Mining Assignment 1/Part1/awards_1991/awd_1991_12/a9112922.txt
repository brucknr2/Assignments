Abstract    :
                   Colucci proposes to study the accuracy of extended (30-day)               
              forecasts by a numerical model, and to identify those dynamical                
              characteristics of initial and evolving states that distiguish                 
              between periods in which the model exhibits low skill, from those              
              with high skill, and those in which forecast skill changes drasti-             
              cally with minor variations in the initially defined state. The                
              technique to be used is "case compositing", in which the climato-              
              logical record is subdivided according to some objective measure of            
              the relevant property (in this case, forecast skill) and composite             
              patterns are constructed for each of the subcategories. Success is             
              shown by finding physically meaningful and interpretable differ-               
              ences between the composites, which may then be used to identify               
              specific model deficiencies. It is highly dependent on the meteor-             
              ological and climatological insights of the practitioner. Colucci's            
              past accomplishments under prior NSF support show that he is well              
              qualified in this respect. The study will contribute to one object-            
              ive of the US Global Change Research Program, viz., an operational             
              numerical forecast model for seasonal climate to be implemented                
              during the 1996-2000 period. Such a model will serve as a stepping             
              stone to subsequent models predicting multi-annual climate changes             
              (induced by natural and/or man-made causes) with sufficient credi-             
              bility to serve as useful guides in the framing of resource-                   
              management policy within the private, national, and international              
              sectors.
