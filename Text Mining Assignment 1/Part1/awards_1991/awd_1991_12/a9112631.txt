Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award is for the acquisition of a modern x-ray diffractometer             
              with wide angle goniometer, texture and thin film analysis                     
              attachments, a germanium detector, and PS/2 computer for                       
              data acquisition and search/match capability.  The instrument will             
              be dedicated to research efforts of investigators in the Department            
              of Materials Science and Engineering, it will be maintained and                
              operated in the Center for Electron Microscopy and Microanalysis,              
              which is used by 5 schools and 14 departments on the campus.  User             
              fees will be applied to maintenance and operation costs.                       
                                                                                             
              Examples of research programs making use of the instrument include:            
              growth of crystalline organic semiconductors; deformation twinning             
              of ordered alloys; ordering of A-site cations in perovskites;                  
              photonic materials and device studies; studies of the structure of             
              semicrystalline and filled polymers, and changes in molecular                  
              orientation in polymers.
