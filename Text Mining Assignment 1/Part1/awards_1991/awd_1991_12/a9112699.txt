Abstract    :
              Dr. Karplus proposes to investigate the structure and structure-               
              function relationships of two flavoenzymes:  ferredoxin:NADP+                  
              reductase (FNR), which is an FAD-dependent enzyme which produces               
              NADPH during photosynthesis, and Old Yellow Enzyme (OYE), an FMN-              
              dependent NADPH oxidase of unknown physiological function.                     
              The main methods to be used in these studies are single crystal x-             
              ray diffraction for structure determination combined with protein              
              chemistry, for purifying the individual enzymes, preparing relevant            
              crystals and complexes, and testing hypotheses based on the                    
              structures.  The time is ripe for the study of both of these                   
              enzymes as they have been cloned and expressed within the last                 
              year, so that site-directed mutagenesis studies can be used to                 
              probe functional aspects of the structure as revealed by                       
              crystallography.                                                               
              %%%                                                                            
              The overall goal is to elucidate the specific structural factors               
              involved in catalysis for both of these enzymes.  The results will             
              give significant insight into general features of flavoprotein                 
              catalysis because FNR is the only structurally known NAD(P)                    
              dependent dehydrogenase-electron transferase and OYE has a flavin              
              environment which is unique with respect to other                              
              characterized flavoenzymes.
