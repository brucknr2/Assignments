Abstract    :
                   A user mode research program will be carried out in few                   
              nucleon physics, in nuclear structure studies, and in deep                     
              inelastic muon scattering.  This work will be carried out                      
              largely at TRIUMF, with reduced level of activities at FNAL                    
              and IUCF.  Improved understanding of the NN interaction below                  
              1 GeV, nuclear structure, and effective interactions are                       
              sought.  Also, new data will be generated regarding the                        
              hadronization of quarks in deep inelastic muon scattering.                     
              Data will be compared to theories including the extended Bonn                  
              potential and relativistic nucleon-nucleus scattering                          
              formalisms.  Simulations, detector development, data analysis,                 
              interpretation, and other related activities will be carried                   
              out at Ohio University.
