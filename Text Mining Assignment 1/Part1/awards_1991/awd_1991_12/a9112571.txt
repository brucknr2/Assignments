Abstract    :
                   The Duke University Phytotron is a controlled environment                 
              facility for experimental research.  The Phytotron is used by Duke             
              researchers and by visiting investigators for a wide variety of                
              research projects.  This facility supports research in plant growth            
              and physiology, plant biochemistry and biophysics, and experimental            
              ecology, to name a few disciplines impacted by this national                   
              research center.                                                               
                   Continued operation of the Duke University Phytotron will                 
              support numerous research projects that increase our understanding             
              of plant biology and the role of plants in biotic communities,                 
              atmospheric chemistry, and global climate dynamics.  This research             
              facility provides significant benefits to student research, and to             
              the general botanical research community.
