Abstract    :
              This Minority Research Planning Grant project is supported                     
              through the Office of Special Projects and the Synthetic                       
              Organic Chemistry Program in Chemistry.  It involves a study of                
              the important role that cyclopropanes play in organic                          
              synthesis.  The cyclopropane ring system lends itself to many                  
              synthetically useful rearrangements and appears as part of a                   
              number of natural products.  While these compounds have been                   
              extensively studied, there is still a good deal of active                      
              research continuing on the syynthesis and chemistry of                         
              cyclopropanes.  This project involves new routes for the                       
              synthesis of highly substituted cyclopropanes and for formation                
              of highly reactive cyclopropane intermediates generated via                    
              carbene chemistry.

              Minority Research Planning Grants are intended to strengthen                   
              the proposal writing and planning capabilities of new                          
              investigators and to facilitate preliminary studies and other                  
              planning activities related to the research.  This project is                  
              that of a chemist who has moved to an academic career after a                  
              brief experience in industry.
