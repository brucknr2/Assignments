Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  An integral component of the multi-agency U.S. Global Change              
              Research Program (Our Changing Planet," Committee on Earth                     
              Sciences, 1991) is understanding and modeling the geospace                     
              environment.  As part of its contribution to the U.S. Global                   
              Change  Research Program, the National Science Foundation's                    
              Division of Atmospheric Sciences has established a new research                
              initiative,  Geospace Environment Modeling (GEM), with the goal                
              of supporting basic research into the dynamical and structural                 
              properties of geospace, leading to the construction of a global                
              geospace model with predictive capability.                                     
                   The subjects of the first GEM campaign are the                            
              magnetospheric boundary, the magnetosheath beyond it, and the                  
              connection from the boundary through the magnetosphere to the                  
              ionosphere.                                                                    
                   This grant is for support to model electron and ion                       
              distribution functions near and within the dayside magnetopause                
              in order to identify key particle signatures of the magnetopause               
              electric and magnetic fields.  The codes prepared for this                     
              project will be made available for inclusion into the GEM                      
              program's Global Circulation Model.
