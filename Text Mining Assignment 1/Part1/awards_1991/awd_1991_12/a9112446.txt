Abstract    :
              The Department of Electrical Engineering at                                    
              Southern Methodist University will purchase                                    
              DC/low frequency device characterization                                       
              equipment which will be dedicated to support                                   
              research in engineering.  The equipment will be                                
              used to support several research programs                                      
              including:  1) Neural Electronics; 2) Applications of                          
              Scanning Tunneling Microscopy; 3) High Tc                                      
              Superconductors; 4) Low Frequency Noise in                                     
              HgCdTe Infrared Detectors; 5) Gallium Arsenide                                 
              Devices; and 6) An Experimental Study of the                                   
              Effects of Surface Texture on Ultra-Thin Gas                                   
              Bearings.
