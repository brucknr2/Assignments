Abstract    :
              Stability analysis for neural control systems is a difficult and               
              important open research question.  The problem is difficult                    
              because neural control systems are inherently non-linear and may               
              involve large scale plants with unknown parameters and structure.              
              The problem is important because practical application of neural               
              control demands that the closed-loop system operate in a stable                
              manner.  In this project several ideas from different control                  
              system fields are integrated to generate stability arguments for               
              neural control systems.  The concepts of Lyapunov functions from               
              adaptive control systems, performance measure minimization and                 
              dynamic programming from optimal control and the adaptive critic               
              from reinforcement learning are combined to formulate a                        
              methodology for stability and convergence rate analysis for                    
              neural controller.
