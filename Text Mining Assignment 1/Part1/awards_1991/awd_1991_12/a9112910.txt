Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The morphological differentiation of commissural and associational             
              neurons in the rat embryo spinal cord will be studied. Single and              
              double labeling using the lipid soluble dyes, DiI and DiA, will be             
              applied to classify neurons according to origin, migration and                 
              dendritic arborization, as well as to determine which classes are              
              innervated by dorsal root afferents.  In addition to standard                  
              fluorescent methods at the light microscopic level, confocal                   
              microscopy and electron microscopy following photoconversion of the            
              fluorescent dyes to electron dense products also will be used.  In             
              addition, the role of nerve growth factor (NGF) on the                         
              differentiation of specific types of neurons will be assessed                  
              following treatment of embryos in utero with antiserum against NGF.            
              These studies are fundamental to understanding how synaptic                    
              specificity develops in the mammalian spinal cord.
