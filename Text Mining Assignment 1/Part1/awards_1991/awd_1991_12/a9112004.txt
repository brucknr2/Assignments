Abstract    :
              The Department of Electrical and Computer                                      
              Engineering of New Jersey Institute of Technology will                         
              purchase parallel processing hardware (specifically,                           
              adapter boards for use in IBM AT-compatible host                               
              computers with INMOS T800 transputers) and                                     
              associated interfacing peripheral equipment and                                
              software which will be dedicated to the support of                             
              research in engineering.  The equipment will be used to                        
              study several issues in the implementation of real-time                        
              parallel feedback control strategies.                                          
              The primary emphasis will be on the application to                             
              antagonistic control, a new concept for controlling the                        
              position of an object by means of strings or wires in                          
              which the tension is actively controlled.  The                                 
              application not only serves as a useful paradigm for                           
              elucidating the issues in implementation of parallel                           
              processing algorithms, but also has the potential of an                        
              entirely new way of achieving accurate position control.                       
              Other uses for research equipment will include                                 
              reconfigurable control and reliable control software.
