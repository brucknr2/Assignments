Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The gene product of unc-104, a gene in the nematode                            
              Caenorhabditis elegans that codes for a kinesin-like protein,                  
              will be studied.  The unc-104 protein will be tested for                       
              mechanochemical translocation activity and the motor domain of                 
              the protein will be defined by site-directed mutagenesis in "in                
              vitro" motility assays.  The unc-104 gene will be sequenced and                
              the temporal and spatial localization of unc-104 mRNA and protein              
              expression will be determined.  To study the specificity of motor              
              and tail domains of the protein, genetically engineered forms of               
              the gene will be introduced into the nematode by DNA                           
              transformation.  These studies promise to increase our                         
              understanding of the role of axonal transport in synaptogenesis                
              at the neuromuscular junction.
