Abstract    :
              The proposed research will lead to improvements in                             
              deterministic fracture mapping methods by evaluating their                     
              effectiveness. Rock samples containing fractures will be                       
              mapped and internal fracture network projections will be                       
              made using standard industrial methods. The samples will be                    
              sectioned while their structure is recorded at each slice.                     
              The maps will then be compared to the revealed structure.                      
              The ability of the standard mapping techniques to                              
              effectively determine the internal structure will be                           
              evaluated. Improvements to the standard mapping techniques                     
              will be proposed.
