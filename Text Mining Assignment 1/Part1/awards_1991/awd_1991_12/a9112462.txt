Abstract    :
              Doctoral Dissertation Student, Gabrielle Hecht; topic:                         
              "Technological Choice and Cultural Change:  The French Nuclear                 
              Program, 1945-69."                                                             
              Under the guidance of Professor Hughes, Ms. Hecht is exploring the             
              genesis of the French nuclear program from 1945 to 1969.  The study            
              focuses on the design and operation of the gas-graphite reactors               
              which constituted the French nuclear energy program in this time               
              period.  In the first part of the study, Ms. Hecht is tracing the              
              ways in which the political, economic, and technological agendas               
              of engineers, managers, public servants, and politicians became                
              embodied in the design of these reactors.  In the second part she              
              is examining the emergence of nuclear safety regulations from the              
              social, cultural, and technological context of the work practices              
              of reactor operators.  The third and final part explains early                 
              public perceptions of nuclear energy in France by looking at how               
              nuclear plants affected regional lifestyles and economies.  The                
              study's aim is to explore the reciprocal relationships between                 
              technology and society as well as the emergence of different                   
              "nuclear cultures" among politicians, engineers, technicians,                  
              workers and local residents.  It does so by analyzing a combination            
              of interviews, archival documents, and publications.  Its primary              
              significance lies in its exploration of relationships between                  
              national political agendas and technological change through an                 
              analysis of the organization of work, and in its examination of                
              relationships between technological choice and cultural change.
