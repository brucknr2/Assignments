Abstract    :
                   A user mode research program will be carried out in                       
              electromagnetic nuclear physics.  New and much more precise                    
              data on the charge structure of the proton and on the short                    
              distance structure of the deuteron will be obtained.                           
              Polarization studies relating to properties of the nucleon and                 
              of few-body systems will be carried out at the MIT/Bates                       
              electron linac and at CEBAF.  These data will lead to improved                 
              understanding of the deuteron and of structure aspects of more                 
              complex nuclei.  Construction of a polarimeter for approved                    
              Bates experiments on polarization transfer will be carried                     
              out.  Also, development work for the CEBAF high resolution                     
              coincidence spectrometers will be carried out, specifically                    
              work relating to the trigger system and data acquisition                       
              system.  R&D, simulations, data analysis, interpretation, and                  
              other related activities will be carried out at William Mary.
