Abstract    :
              Stratospheric ozone depletion in polar regions is of scientific                
              and public concern because ozone absorbs ultraviolet radiation                 
              from the sun.  UV-radiation causes DNA damage.  Dr. Yayanos                    
              proposes to quantify the effects of increased solar UV-radiation               
              at the sea surface.  He will develop methods to measure the                    
              amount of thymine dimers, one of the main photoproducts formed in              
              DNA, in sea surface microbial communities. In addition, attempts               
              will be made to show that there is a variation in the level of                 
              thymine dimers on a diel basis.  The concentration level of                    
              thymine dimers in the sea surface microbial community may be                   
              useful in developing a global model of ecosystem damage resulting              
              from stratospheric ozone depletion.  Furthermore, if the high                  
              performance liquid chromatograph method or the method based on                 
              DNA processing enzymes works for detecting thymine dimers, then                
              it would allow for the search for thymine dimers buried over                   
              geological time in sediments  and in ice.  The pilot studies                   
              proposed will be conducted on samples collected from southern                  
              California coastal waters.
