              research findings and lessons learned from                                     
              recent damaging earthquakes, and resultant                                     
              changes in mitigation, preparedness,                                           
              response, and reconstruction practice.  This                                   
              workshop will be held in Hawaii, November 13-                                  
              15, 1991.  As the International Decade for                                     
              Natural Disaster Reduction begins, this                                        
              workshop will provide an opportunity for the                                   
              U.S. and Japan to build on earlier                                             
              collaborative research efforts and to                                          
              strengthen existing ties.  It will provide a                                   
              basis for future program planning for                                          
              earthquake hazard reduction research.
