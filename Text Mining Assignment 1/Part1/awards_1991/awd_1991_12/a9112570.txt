Abstract    :
              Inorganic phosphate and ATP are involved in more chemical reactions            
              on the earth's surface than any other compound except water.                   
              Phosphate entry into eukaryotic cells and into their organelles is             
              catalyzed by at least two distinct types of transport system, one,             
              a Na+/P transporter and the other a H+/P transporter.  Past work               
              supported by NSF resulted in the identification of the H+/P                    
              transporter as a 32-35 kDa protein, its purification,                          
              reconstitution, cloning, sequencing, expression in E. coli, and                
              import into isolated mitochondria.  Future Specific Aims during the            
              grant period are 6-fold and will be to.                                        
              %%%                                                                            
              Establish whether the functional form of the H+/Pi transporter                 
              in its native membrane environment is a monomer or a higher ordered            
              oligomer.  Express functionally the full length cDNA of the                    
              H+/Pi transporter and verify its membrane topology.  Introduce                 
              both site directed and random mutations in the functionally                    
              expressed transporter in order to identify candidate amino acids               
              involved in transport. Initiate studies which may prove                        
              valuable in supplying 3-Dimensional structural information about               
              the H+/Pi transporter.  Determine to what extent homologous                    
              H+/Pi transporters are expressed in plant and animal cells. Compare            
              the regulatory events involved in the expression of H+/Pi                      
              transporter Gene(s) in plant and animal cells.
