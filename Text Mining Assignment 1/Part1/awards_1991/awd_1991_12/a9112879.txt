Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              We propose to complete construction and implementation of an                   
              Imaging Fabry-Perot Spectrometer (IFPS) which will be used in long-            
              term studies of emission-line objects with the 8.1-m Perkins                   
              Telescope at Lowell Observatory.  A variety of etalons with                    
              spectral resolution from R = 1200 to R = 20,000 will be used to                
              obtain two-dimensional spectroscopy of active galactic nuclei,                 
              starburst galaxies, irregular galaxies, and galactic emission                  
              nebulate (H II regions, planetaries, and supernova remnants) in                
              order to study the velocity fields and variations in physical                  
              conditions across spatially resolved objects.  A custom-designed               
              optical system enables us to use the IFPS from the near ultraviolet            
              to the far red region of the optical spectrum.  The combination of             
              a high-throughput system, a stable, high quantum efficiency                    
              detector, and significant amounts of observing time will allow                 
              important problems in fundamental astrophysics to be addressed with            
              a moderate-aperture telescope.
