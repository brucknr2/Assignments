Abstract    :
              Carrier confinement to reduced dimensions has recently become                  
              accessible to condensed matter experimentalists due to advances in             
              microfabrication technology.  The ability to create three-                     
              dimensionally confined structures, termed "quantum dots", has                  
              generated intensed interest in the investigation of artificially               
              structured low dimensional systems.  These structures are analogous            
              to semiconductor atoms, with energy level tunable by the confining             
              potentials.  This proposal is aimed at a better understanding of               
              the electronic transport in these systems and proposes a variety of            
              novel structures to elucidate the relevant physics of low                      
              dimensional quantum transport.
