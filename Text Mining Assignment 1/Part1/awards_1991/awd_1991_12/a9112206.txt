Abstract    :
              Equipment will be purchased and dedicated initially to the                     
              development of advanced superplastic materials.  The program will              
              be interdisciplinary in nature, involving collaboration amongst                
              faculty and students in the Departments of Mechanical Engineering,             
              Physics and Aerospace Engineering.  After gaining experience                   
              through this program, the equipment will be utilized for the                   
              development of and fundamental studies on other classes of                     
              materials which can be processed using similar principles.  The                
              major items of equipment requested in this proposal are an                     
              attritor, a glove box, a set of microfine sieves and a shaker and,             
              a blade cutting mill.  The investigators involved already have                 
              equipment for melt spinning, hot isostatic pressing and                        
              superplastic testing.  They also have access to extensive material             
              characterization facilities.  These equipment and facilities will              
              be used along with the requested equipment to develop new                      
              superplastic materials as detailed in the project description of               
              this proposal.
