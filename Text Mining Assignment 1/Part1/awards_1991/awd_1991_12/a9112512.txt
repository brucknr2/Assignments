Abstract    :
              The object of this study is to acquire a resonant column and a                 
              constant rate strain oedometer device with automatic data                      
              acquisition capabilities to assess integrity and performance                   
              of earthen material that has been environmentally impacted. The                
              equipment will be used to measure low strain stiffness and                     
              compressibility of polluted soils; stiffness/compressibility                   
              of stabilized polluted soils; stiffness/shear wave velocity of                 
              stabilized/solidified industrial residues.
