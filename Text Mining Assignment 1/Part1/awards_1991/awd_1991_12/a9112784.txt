Abstract    :
                   Technical writing for statistics and probability journals                 
              demands a special style and use of writing techniques unique to                
              mathematical sciences.  At this mentoring workshop new researchers             
              can acquire these specialized skills from senior researchers who               
              have also served as editors of principal journals in statistics and            
              probabilty.
