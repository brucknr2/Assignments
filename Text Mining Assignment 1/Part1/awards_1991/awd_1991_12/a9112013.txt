Abstract    :
                   The theory that "water-stress" improves the nutritional                   
              quality of plants for insect herbivores and leads to outbreaks                 
              has received much support.  Although studies report improved                   
              performances for insects fed water-stressed foliage others have                
              shown that insects either avoid or grow poorly on water-stressed               
              plant.  It appears that Orthoptera and sapfeeding insects tend to              
              benefit from plant water-stress, but leaf chewers and                          
              skeletonizers do not.                                                          
                   The P.I. Will test the hypothesis and that the effect of                  
              water-stress in plants on herbivorous insects depends on the                   
              feeding mode of the insect.  He will perform preferences and                   
              controlled rearing experiments examine the effects of water-                   
              stress in the host plant on feeding and oviposition preference,                
              growth, survival, and fecundity in ten insect species distributed              
              among three feeding guilds and four insect orders.  Soybeans will              
              be the experiments since the physiology and biochemistry of                    
              soybean under water-stress is well known.                                      
                   These experiments will enhance our knowledge of the                       
              interactions of soybean with several of its insect pests, and                  
              allow the identification of the effects of water-stress in plants              
              on insects herbivores depends on insect feeding mode.  This                    
              information will help explain the complex responses of insects to              
              water-stressed plants.
