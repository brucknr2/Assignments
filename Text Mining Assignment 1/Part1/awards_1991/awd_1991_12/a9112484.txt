Abstract    :
              This NSF Engineering Research Equipment Grant                                  
              will enable the purchase of a Neodymium-YAG                                    
              infrared laser, an infrared TV camera, and an                                  
              infrared scanning Fabry Perot optical spectrum                                 
              analyzer for novel electro-optical modulator research                          
              at Caltech.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              A serious difficulty in extending the operation of                             
              travelling-wave electro-optical modulators into the 100                        
              GHz (3mm) region is caused by dispersion in the                                
              modulator material, crystalline lithium niobate.  The                          
              optical wave travels through the crystal much faster                           
              than the modulation wave; as a consequence, the                                
              modulation process gets out of step at these high                              
              frequencies.  A technique being studied at Caltech                             
              breaks the modulation transmission line into a                                 
              number of short segments, and drives each segment                              
              from its own tiny dipole antenna integrated on the                             
              surface of the crystal.  The antennas are excited by a                         
              plane wave radiated from a waveguide, incident at                              
              just the correct angle to keep the modulating wave in                          
              step with the optical wave on the average.  As a                               
              bonus, using antennas and radiation rather than coax                           
              connectors and bond wires to couple the modulation                             
              to the transmission lines eliminates parasitic electrical                      
              elements that would be very detrimental in the mm-                             
              wave range.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              Modulation frequencies as high as 63 GHz (4.8 m)                               
              have been used with an 18 mm long lithium niobate                              
              modulator with good efficiency.  These initial                                 
              experiments employed red laser light at 633 nm.                                
              Practical fiber optical systems that use such                                  
              modulators for information transmission (telephone,                            
              CATV, radar signals, etc.) all operate at 1320 or 1550                         
              nm, however.  This grant will allow the extension of                           
              this wave-coupled modulator research to those                                  
              wavelengths.
