Abstract    :
              The Department of Electrical and Computer                                      
              Engineering a North Carolina State University will                             
              purchase a low temperature probe station, capable                              
              of reaching temperatures as low as 70 K (Degrees                               
              Kelvin), and low current switching matrix cards                                
              which will be dedicated to support research in                                 
              engineering.  The equipment will be used in                                    
              research projects whose goals are to gain a                                    
              fundamental understanding of the nature of                                     
              electrically active bulk oxide traps in the gate                               
              oxides of insulated gate field transistors (IGFETs).                           
              In particular, this equipment will provide a means                             
              of determining if the charge free regions observed                             
              at the SiO2 interfaces of such IGFETs are defect                               
              free regions or contain defects that can trap                                  
              electron (or holes) but do not retain these trapped                            
              carriers due to tunneling from these sites to the                              
              interface or thermally assisted detrapping.  In                                
              addition, this equipment will allow for more                                   
              accurate measurement of the density and cross                                  
              section of neutral electron and neutral hole traps by                          
              providing temperatures low enough to eliminate the                             
              detrapping which occurs with both of these types of                            
              traps.  It will also be possible to characterize the                           
              detrapping associated with the traps using this                                
              equipment.
