Abstract    :
                   Extension of the period of useful forecasts by dynamical-                 
              numerical models of the atmospheric circulation is the goal of a               
              rapidly growing body of ongoing and proposed research in large                 
              scale dynamic meteorology. Recent success in improving the accuracy            
              and utility of short (0-5 day)-, and medium (5-10 day)-range numer-            
              ical forecasts has stimulated intensified interest in the problems             
              associated with developing models that can exhibit forecast skill              
              in the extended (10 day to seasonal)-range and beyond.  One line of            
              research concerns the set of observed atmospheric flow phenomena               
              with characteristic periods of variation in the extended range, and            
              generally of hemispheric/global spatial scale (in particular, mid-             
              latitude "blocking", teleconnection patterns, and zonal index                  
              cycles of the jet-stream and its associated storm-track regions).              
              The PI's propose to study the processes leading to the onset and               
              evolution of similar features in a suite of simple theoretical                 
              models which have exhibited similar behavior in their prior                    
              research. Understanding these processes in such simple models will             
              help to guide the interpretation of forecast errors in the solu-               
              tions of the more complex quasi-operational models now being used              
              in experimental dynamical extended-range forecasts, and the step-              
              wise elimination of the sources of these errors.
