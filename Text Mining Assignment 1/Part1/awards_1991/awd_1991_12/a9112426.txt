Abstract    :
              The goal of this research is to provide power supply                           
              designers with a more realistic and practical design                           
              methodology that will enable them to meet design                               
              specifications of the present and future applications                          
              in aerospace and industrial concerns.  The design                              
              strategy results in converters with smaller weight                             
              and volume, reduced device stresses with the                                   
              highest possible system efficiency.  These goals are                           
              achieved by solving a multiobjective optimization                              
              formulation that provides the Pareto-optimum                                   
              designs for the diverse and non-commensurable                                  
              objectives of the designer.
