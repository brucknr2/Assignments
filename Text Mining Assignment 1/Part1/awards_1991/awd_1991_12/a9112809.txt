              Dr. Ionel Haiduc of Babes-Bolyai University, Cluj-Napoca,                      
              Romania will visit Dr. Robert Bruce King of the University                     
              of Georgia, Athens, to initiate joint chemical research on                     
              planar selenocarbons and tellurocarbons.  Results are                          
              expected to contribute to the definition of a longer-term                      
              and mutually beneficial cooperative research project in                        
              inorganic chemistry for consideration by the National                          
              Science Foundation or the National Academy of Sciences.
