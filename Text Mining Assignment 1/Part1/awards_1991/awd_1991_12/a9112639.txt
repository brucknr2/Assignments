Abstract    :
              A dye laser system will be purchased to support fundamental                    
              investigations of Diesel combustion and emission formation                     
              processes being conducted in two unique experimental                           
              facilities -an optically accessible, DI Diesel engine and a                    
              high pressure, chemical flow reactor.  An Engine Company, NSF,                 
              and the Department of Energy are sponsoring research on the                    
              evolution of soot and NO within the combustion chamber of a                    
              specially constructed Diesel engine; this research uses laser-                 
              based, planar imaging of soot and NO.  The objective of the                    
              study is to obtain an improved understanding of the processes                  
              so that in-cylinder strategies can be developed to                             
              simultaneously reduce NOx and particulate emissions.  To                       
              complement the engine research on Diesel combustion, a high                    
              pressure, chemical flow reactor is being used to study the                     
              effects of pressure on the chemistry of hydrocarbon auto-                      
              ignition related to Diesel cold starting and knock.  In                        
              addition to the measurement of stable products, important                      
              radical species will be determined by fluorescence or                          
              adsorption techniques.                                                         
                                                                                             
              This research is motivated by the needs of Diesel engine                       
              manufacturers who cannot meet the NOx and particulate                          
              emissions standards set by the Environmental Protection Agency                 
              for 1994 without the use of particulate traps which will                       
              adversely affect engine reliability and fuel economy.
