Abstract    :
              A combined Reactive Ion Etcher (RIE) / Plasma-                                 
              Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition (PE-CVD)                                    
              apparatus will be purchased, for use in research in                            
              high speed electronic and optoelectronic devices.                              
              The equipment will support the research of at least                            
              nine faculty members.  It is critical for at least eight                       
              on-going research projects, including the                                      
              investigation of heterostructure bipolar and field-                            
              effect transistors, guided-wave and multiple                                   
              quantum well modulators, patterned epitaxial                                   
              growth, metallization research and atomic diffusion                            
              studies in III-V semiconductors.  For future                                   
              projects, the equipment will allow investigation of                            
              epitaxial structures and devices scaled to micron                              
              submicron dimensions.  It provides a necessary                                 
              complement to the advanced electron beam                                       
              lithography equipment and epitaxial crystal growth                             
              available at UCSD.
