Abstract    :
              This award provides partial support for the conference "Directions             
              and Implications of Advanced Computing (DIAC-92)" to be held in                
              Berkeley, California on May 2-3, 1992.  The objective of the                   
              conference is to help build an understanding of a wide range of                
              social and ethical concerns relating to computing technology.  The             
              approach is to sponsor an open scientific forum and disseminate the            
              results.  Presenters at the symposium include invited speakers as              
              well as those selected on the basis of submitted papers.  An                   
              interdisciplinary, broadly representative group of persons with                
              expertise and interest in impacts of computing form the selection              
              committee.  Results include a proceedings as well as other                     
              publications in a wide variety of outlets.  The funds from NSF will            
              be used to support some travel, publicity, and printing costs of               
              the proceedings for the conference.                                            
                                                                                             
              The topic of this proposal is of highest priority for Ethics and               
              Values Studies.  The qualifications and track record of the                    
              investigators and organization are excellent.  The project provides            
              an important effort to encourage interdisciplinary communication               
              about important social and ethical concerns associated with new                
              developments in computing.  Results will be useful for a wide range            
              of individuals and groups.  The budget is modest.  The proposal is             
              recommended for support.
