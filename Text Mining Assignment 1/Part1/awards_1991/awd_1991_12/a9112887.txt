Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The feasibility of inducing triploidy in red abalone (Haliotis                 
              rufescens) through temperature shock and chemical treatment was                
              demonstrated in Phase I research.  Triploid abalone should be                  
              reproductively sterile and channel metabolic energy into the                   
              growth of meat and shell at a rate greater than sexually mature                
              diploids. In Phase II, the principal research effort will focus                
              on methods to maximize triploid production. Objectives for Phase               
              II research are: 1) to optimize triploid production methodology                
              by manipulating treatment timing and dosage to maximize triploid               
              induction while minimizing treatment mortalities; and 2) to                    
              observe diploid and triploid embryos to gain insight into the                  
              effects that triploid induction methods have upon early                        
              developmental events involving the activity of maternal                        
              centromeres and microtubule formation.                                         
                                                                                             
              The induction of triploidy in abalone could increase growth rates              
              of farmed abalone thus increasing farm profitability.  And the                 
              development of simplified methods for the induction of triploidy               
              would enable all farmers easy access to this tool.//
