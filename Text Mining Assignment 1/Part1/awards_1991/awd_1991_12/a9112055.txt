Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Ascorbate, a water-soluble vitamin, is suggested to play a role                
              in modulating the synaptic effects of dopamine and glutamate.  To              
              investigate this issue, ascorbate release will be monitored with               
              an electrochemically modified carbon-fiber electrode in the                    
              neostriatum and other forebrain regions in freely moving animals.              
              Various manipulations, including lesions and intracerebral                     
              infusions, will assess the involvement of several extrastriatal                
              systems in neostriatal ascorbate release.  Functional                          
              interactions of ascorbate with dopamine and glutamate will be                  
              examined with single-unit recordings.  Parallel studies will                   
              assess both dopaminergic and glutaminergic mechanisms underlying               
              the behavioral supersensitivity to dopamine agonists, which has                
              been shown to occur during withdrawal from long-term ascorbate                 
              treatment.
