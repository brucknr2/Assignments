Abstract    :
              A gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (GC/MS) with a mass                      
              selective detector is to be purchased with this equipment                      
              grant.  This will compliment and enhance existing analytical                   
              capabilities within the chemical engineering department, with                  
              specific applications to research on the combustion of                         
              chlorinated liquid and solid fuels aimed at gaining an                         
              understanding of the formation and destruction of intermediate                 
              products including dioxins and furans.  The specific                           
              objectives are to acquire kinetic data on PCDD/PCDFs in                        
              spouted-bed and fixed-bed reactors in order to understand                      
              accepted formation mechanisms better; to elucidate the role of                 
              temperature residence time, precursor partial pressure, and                    
              particle size on rates and yields; to model these processes;                   
              and to identify the steps and parameters that require more                     
              intensive study.                                                               
                                                                                             
              The GC/MS will greatly improve the ability to provide                          
              quantitative analyses of many samples.  This in turn will                      
              enhance the likelihood that relationships to probable                          
              precursors can be better understood, and from that knowledge                   
              the role of certain operation and design parameters on                         
              products of incomplete combustion in actual incinerators can                   
              be addressed.
