Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to develop an object-                         
              oriented framework for the construction of comprehensive                       
              and extensible geotechnical engineering software, and to                       
              thereby put realistic non-linear modeling capabilities in                      
              the hands of engineers with an interactive,                                    
              quasi-real-time environment. To this end, object-oriented                      
              concepts will be developed to allow an intuitive approach                      
              to problem solving.
