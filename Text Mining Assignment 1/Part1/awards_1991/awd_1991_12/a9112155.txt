Abstract    :
              The School of Chemical Engineering at Purdue University will                   
              purchase an atomic force microscope, which will be dedicated                   
              to support materials research.  The equipment will be used for                 
              several research projects:  (1) study of the mechanical                        
              properties of a single submicron particle supported on a flat                  
              substrate, (2) study of the formation of ultrathin ceramic                     
              films, and (3) characterization of the structure of metal                      
              clustersa supported on oxide supports.
