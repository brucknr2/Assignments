Abstract    :
              This research is concerned with mesoscopic phenomena in gallium                
              arsenide and metal microstructures, primarily related to                       
              conductance fluctuations, tunneling, and phase coherence.  One-                
              dimensional wires will be fabricated using electron-beam lithograpy            
              techniques followed by ion-beam irradiation that produces a                    
              relatively sharp boundary between insulating and metallic regions.             
              These one-dimensional wires will be used to study quantum chaotic              
              scattering, a new and active field of physics.  One-dimensional                
              wires of beta-tantalum will also be made to provide a cleaner                  
              system for the study of universal conductance fluctuations.  In a              
              third area a Wheatstone Bridge will be constructed of four gallium             
              arsenide arms that will be utilized to detect single photons.  A DX            
              center in the gallium arsenide will absorb a single photon                     
              leading to a conductance fluctuation "step".  This is a novel                  
              optical processing approach that leads to a discrete known change              
              in the configuration of scattering centers.
