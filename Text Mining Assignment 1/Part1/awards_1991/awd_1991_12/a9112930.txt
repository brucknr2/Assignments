Abstract    :
              Thomas         This research is on algorithms and techniques for system-  level
              synthesis of digital electronic systems.  Inputs to the  system are intended to
              be high level specifications in terms of  system behavior.  Research builds on
              two existing design systems;  the system architects workbench, and a
              microcomputer board design  system, called MICON.  Research issues being
              investigated are:  partitioning specifications for appropriate style selection,
               synthesis - including learning and problem solving approaches,  internal
              representation of design information, system level  design representation and
              human interface, and  controlled  iteration with different types of synthesis
              tools (design process  control).  The algorithms are being integrated into a
              prototype  system-level synthesis framework.
