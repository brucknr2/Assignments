Abstract    :
                   Investigations are carried out on two aspects of atom-cavity              
              emission.  One research area will be the resonance fluorescence                
              of a single atom coupled to a degenerate optical resonator mode.               
              Such a system exhibits two resonant peaks, one near the free-                  
              space atomic resonance frequency and a second near the empty-                  
              cavity frequency.  These peaks evolve into the normal mode                     
              splitting when the cavity frequency and the atom frequency                     
              coincide.  A detailed study of this behavior, both on and off                  
              resonance, will provide information on micro-dynamical quantum                 
              processes.  Effects of stimulated emission and absorption will                 
              also be studied.  A second area of study will be the emission of               
              an atom-cavity system in which the atom (or atoms) is prepared in              
              an inverted state.  The gain for such a system can be large, and               
              emission rates and linewidths will be studied to observe the                   
              transition from enhanced spontaneous emission to stimulated                    
              emission ("atom-cavity laser").  Photon statistics will also be                
              studied.
