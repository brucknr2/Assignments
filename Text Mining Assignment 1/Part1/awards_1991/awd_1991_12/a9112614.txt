Abstract    :
              The equipment requested will be used for several projects,                     
              including:  Structure and Dynamics of Antigen-Antibody                         
              Complexes; Applications of Antibody Engineering; Protein                       
              Engineering of Allosteric Antibodies; Protein Separations                      
              Utilizing Temperature Sensitive Microemulsions;                                
              Engineering Protein Crystallization Processes; Mechanisms                      
              of Neurite Outgrowth and Guidance; Development of                              
              Hepatocyte Long Term Culture and Storage Techniques;                           
              Cellular and Developmental Biology in Plant Cell Cultures;                     
              and Immobilized Recombinant Cells.  The wide dynamic range                     
              offered by the combination of the two instruments, and the                     
              simultaneous use of the instruments in certain projects,                       
              will allow for an enhanced understanding of underlying                         
              biochemical and biophysical phenomena.
