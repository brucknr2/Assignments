Abstract    :
                Professors Lindsay and Lombardi are funded by a grant from                   
              the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to study the                       
              resonance Raman spectra of mass-selected metal clusters in rare                
              gas matrices.  Neutral cluster species of Ag, Rh, Bi, Mo, Nb                   
              and others will be interrogated by absorption, excitation,                     
              fluorescence, and resonance Raman spectroscopy.  The resonance                 
              Raman spectra will provide the vibrational frequencies for                     
              structural assignment. The ability to mass-select will allow                   
              the parentage of a set of observed spectra to be established                   
              and will eliminate possible interferences by the spectra of                    
              other clusters.                                                                
              %%%                                                                            
              Clusters of metal atoms will be produced and deposited with                    
              rare gas atoms in very cold samples.  By preselecting clusters                 
              of specific mass, it will be possible to observe the spectra,                  
              make assignments, and deduce the molecular structure                           
              associated with a specific cluster.  The properties of these                   
              groupings of atoms which are between the single atom and the                   
              bulk metal may be important in ultra-miniaturized electronic                   
              circuits, in nanostructures which are materials of molecular                   
              size, and perhaps in quantum dot devices.
