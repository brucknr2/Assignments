Abstract    :
                   An integral component of the multi-agency U.S. Global Change              
              Research Program (Our Changing Planet," Committee on Earth                     
              Sciences, 1991) is understanding and modeling the geospace                     
              environment.  As part of its contribution to the U.S. Global                   
              Change  Research Program, the National Science Foundation's                    
              Division of Atmospheric Sciences has established a new research                
              initiative,  Geospace Environment Modeling (GEM), with the goal                
              of supporting basic research into the dynamical and structural                 
              properties of geospace, leading to the construction of a global                
              geospace model with predictive capability.                                     
                   The subjects of the first GEM campaign are the                            
              magnetospheric boundary, the magnetosheath beyond it, and the                  
              connection from the boundary through the magnetosphere to the                  
              ionosphere.                                                                    
                   This grant is for support to deploy an array of                           
              magnetometers at cusp/cleft latitudes in a joint effort with                   
              Augsburg College.  The purpose of the array is to study                        
              ionospheric waves associated with the magnetospheric cusp and                  
              neighboring regions.  In association with the radar system that                
              will be operating in the same area, this magnetometer array will               
              provide high time resolution, two-dimensional data in the                      
              electrodynamics of cusp convection.
