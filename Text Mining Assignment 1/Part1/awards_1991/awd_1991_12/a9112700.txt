Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              One of the most perplexing questions of game theory is how to                  
              analyze potential deviations from an equilibrium by a coalition of             
              players.  This project will take a "neologistic" approach to the               
              problem, that is, to model negotiating statements explicitly, and              
              to study their credibility.  Based on ideas of others, the approach            
              is so powerful that even in two player games, it forces one in some            
              cases to retreat from equilibrium analysis to a rationalizable                 
              mode.  But in such cases, additional "natural language" assumptions            
              must be formulated, or else neologisms are always impotent (unless             
              one player is artificially silenced).                                          
                                                                                             
              The potential applications to this research are unlimited:                     
              theoretical progress on coalition formation is awaited by                      
              researchers in many applied fields, including industrial                       
              organization, law and economics, finance, and international trade.             
              The project also promises important insight in the understanding               
              of the roles of communication, signalling and renegotiation in                 
              social settings.
