Abstract    :
              A Workshop on Discrete Event Systems (DES) is being                            
              held during the weekend of June 21-23, 1991.  The field                        
              of DES emerged in the early 1980's as an effort to                             
              extend classical system and control theory to discrete-                        
              state event-driven dynamic systems and to solve many                           
              critical technological problems commonly encountered                           
              in areas such as manufacturing, computer systems, and                          
              communication networks.  Although the field has                                
              reached a stage of healthy maturity, it is still young and                     
              multidisciplinary in nature.  The proposal for this                            
              Workshop stems from a broad-based interest to bring                            
              together people from both academia and industry who                            
              are actively involved in DES research.  The main                               
              objectives of the Workshop are:                                                
                                                                                             
              (a)   to consolidate contributions to date and explore                         
                    the field's potential for practical impact on                            
                    existing and future technologies,                                        
                                                                                             
              (b)   to stimulate interaction among DES researchers                           
                    from different disciplines and varying schools of                        
                    thought,                                                                 
                                                                                             
              (c)   to expose students to ongoing activities in the                          
                    DES field and foster their interest,                                     
                                                                                             
              (d)   to identify benchmark problems forming the                               
                    targets for future research directions.                                  
                                                                                             
              The Workshop is to be conducted in an informal but                             
              well-structured setting, emphasizing open discussions of                       
              critical technical issues and tutorial presentations.  It is                   
              planned for approximately 50 people from various                               
              disciplines including systems and control, operations                          
              research, industrial engineering, and computer science.
