Abstract    :
              A state-of-the-art system for steady-state isotopic transient                  
              kinetic analysis (SSITKA) is built from component parts.  The                  
              system will be used to kinetically map heterogeneous catalyst                  
              surfaces under rigorous reaction conditions of temperature and                 
              pressure, to delineate the role of catalyst promoters and                      
              other elements of multicomponent catalyst systems, and to                      
              computational analyze such issues as reabsorption and                          
              diffusion.
