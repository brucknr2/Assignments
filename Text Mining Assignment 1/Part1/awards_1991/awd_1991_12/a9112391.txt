Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Nerve cells communicate with each other by secreting chemical                  
              messengers known as neurotransmitters.  Exocytosis, a form of                  
              secretion, is a cellular process which involves the fusion of                  
              membranes, resulting in the discharge of substances from cells.                
              Though poorly understood, the mechanism of exocytosis is of                    
              fundamental importance for understanding synaptic transmission                 
              and intercellular communication between cells.  The goal of this               
              research project is to ascertain the steps involved in the                     
              regulation of exocytosis that occur in neuronal and paraneuronal               
              cells.  Dr. Holz will examine the role of annexins, a class of                 
              lipoproteins, in the process of exocytosis.  Previous results                  
              suggest that annexins play a significant role in the normal                    
              secretory pathway.  Experiments using cultured chromaffin cells                
              will be used to determine if annexins interact with granule, a                 
              specialized cell product involved in secretion, and to test the                
              possibility that annexins may regulate the binding of granule to               
              the plasma membrane.  Results of these studies are likely to be                
              applicable to the understanding of presynaptic events in synaptic              
              transmission.
