Abstract    :
              This is a proposal to purchase a Mass Spectrometer to support                  
              three investigators in the Respiratory Research Laboratories of                
              the Biomedical Engineering Department.  The equipment accurately               
              and continuously measures the concentration of inspired and                    
              expired gases.  The three investigators study the relationships                
              between lung structure, lung mechanics and gas transport using                 
              mathematical techniques extensively used to characterize                       
              engineering systems.  The research will result in better                       
              understanding of lung function; such understanding should                      
              eventually result in the development of improved diagnostic and                
              therapeutic technologies.
