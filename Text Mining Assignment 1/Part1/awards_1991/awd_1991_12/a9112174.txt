Abstract    :
              The primary objective of this proposal is to study the archaeology             
              and paleoecology of the Broken Mammoth and Mead sites in central               
              Alaska. Preliminary archaeological testing of these sites provided             
              an abundance of artifacts, faunal and other organic materials from             
              the late Pleistocene-Holocene, 11,500-10,500 B.P. This may be the              
              first conclusive evidence that humans and mammoths coexisted in                
              Alaska and could provide the most detailed picture of human                    
              subsistence thus far discovered in northern North America. In                  
              addition, this study will provide information about human                      
              adaptation and climate change in Beringia, the main migration route            
              of humans to the New World.
