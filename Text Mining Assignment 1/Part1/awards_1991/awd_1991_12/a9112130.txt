Abstract    :
              This grant is for equipment to establish a digital VLSI design                 
              laboratory.  The research projects that are making use of the                  
              equipment include:  VLSI architectures for adaptive filters and                
              adders, a high-level design system, and a concurrent                           
              hardware/software specification and design system.
