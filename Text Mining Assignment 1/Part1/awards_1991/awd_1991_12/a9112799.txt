Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Few contemporary issues are as threatening of the domestic order               
              and stability of the United States as that of the race relations.              
              As a consequence, Political Scientists have invested heavily in                
              research on the nature, dynamics and determinants of racial                    
              attitudes in America.  To date, however, virtually all of this                 
              research has focussed on the attitudes of white Americans.  Very               
              little attention has been given to the racial attitudes of blacks.             
              This research replicates a major 1968 survey of racial attitudes               
              in the racially diverse Detroit metropolitan area in order to                  
              develop longitudinal data on the changing racial attitudes of both             
              white and especially black Americans.                                          
                                                                                             
              Specifically, this research will use data on racial attitudes over             
              the past quarter century to test an enhanced theoretical model of              
              black racial attitudes, develop a more comprehensive understanding             
              of black's perceptions of racial discrimination, and examine the               
              nature, extend, and causes of these attitudes over time.                       
              Examination of white racial attitudes in the same community will               
              serve as a valuable point of comparison.                                       
                                                                                             
              When completed this ambitious project should greatly increase our              
              understanding of the nature and direction of race relations in the             
              United States and provide a better foundation with which to address            
              any remaining obstacles to the improvement of these relations.
