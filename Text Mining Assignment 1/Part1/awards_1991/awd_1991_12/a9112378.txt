Abstract    :
              The use of very high pressures to modify reaction                              
              kinetics and thermodynamics is a well known                                    
              concept that has been rarely used in the context of                            
              thin film growth.  In this proposal we request                                 
              partial funding for the acquisition of a high                                  
              pressure reactor system for the synthesis of thin                              
              film oxides at growth pressures as high as 20,000                              
              psi.  This facility will allow us to expand the scope                          
              and enhance current research into high pressure                                
              thin film oxidation synthesis.  Preliminary                                    
              experiments have shown that high pressure                                      
              oxidation processing allows the use of much lower                              
              processing temperatures which minimize                                         
              interactions between substrate materials and thin                              
              film overlayers.  In one project, we have                                      
              demonstrated the utility of this technique for the                             
              passivation of Group IV heterostructure                                        
              semiconductor systems.  It also represents a novel                             
              method for the synthesis of oxide thin films for                               
              optical, electronic, ferroelectric, and                                        
              superconducting applications.
