Abstract    :
              The Departments of Mechanical and Chemical Engineering at Yale                 
              University will purchase an electric spray source and                          
              accessories for studying particles ranging in size from atomic                 
              dimensions to 100m.  The electrospray source will be                          
              optimized to extract high mobility ions and macroions from                     
              electrosprays of volatile liquids.  Applications include a                     
              large range of processes, from spray combustion to mass                        
              spectrometric analysis of large biomolecules.
