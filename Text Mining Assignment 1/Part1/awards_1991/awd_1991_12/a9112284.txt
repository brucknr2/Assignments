Abstract    :
              This Research Equipment Grant (REG) provides funding for the                   
              purchase of a Laser-induced Fluorescence (LIF) thermal imaging                 
                                                                                             
              system.  The Department of Mechanical Engineering at Carnegie                  
              Mellon University will dedicate this system to support general                 
                                                                                             
              thermoscience research.  Near term research topics in which                    
              the proposed system will be utilized include cooling of                        
              turbine components, space shuttle propulsion, thermal control                  
              of computer disk data storage systems, air pollution,                          
              electronic material processing, and fundamental turbulence                     
              transport.
