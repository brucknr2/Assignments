Abstract    :
              Dr. Goldberg is continuing his research toward a biography of                  
              General Leslie R. Groves, Commanding General of the Manhattan                  
              Engineer District.  The fact that no scholarly biography of Groves             
              has been written would be reason enough to justify this project.               
              In almost all treatments of Groves, he appears full blown and                  
              unexplained in September 1942 in the office of OSRD Director                   
              Vannevar Bush.  Dr. Goldberg's study provides a context for                    
              understanding who Leslie R. Groves was, why he was picked to head              
              the atom bomb project and why he was so effective.  In addition,               
              this study is a vehicle for analyzing anew the changing                        
              relationship between the miliary and civilian sectors of the                   
              American scientific and technological research communities during              
              and immediately after World War II.  This grant allows the                     
              completion of the archival research for this project.
