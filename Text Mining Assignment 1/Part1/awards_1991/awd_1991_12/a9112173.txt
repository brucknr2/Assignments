Abstract    :
                   This work in nuclear theory will use perturbative QCD                     
              techniques to study the short distance nature of meson production              
              in nuclei, glueball production and electroproduction of baryons.               
              The results will be relevant for future experiments being planned              
              for CEBAF.
