              Description:  Under this project support is provided for                       
              participation of seven U.S. scientists in the International                    
              Symposium on Fatigue and Fracture in Steel and Concrete                        
              Structures to be held in Madras, India in December 1991.   The                 
              technical sessions will include the  following topics: Fracture                
              Mechanics; Fatigue and Fracture of Steel; Fatigue  and Fracture                
              of Concrete; Crack Growth; Fatigue Behavior   and Testing of                   
              Joints; Fatigue Behavior and Testing of                                        
              Structural Members; Condition Monitoring and Damage                            
              Assessment; Life Prediction; Design; and Reliability.  The                     
              organizing secretary is Dr. A.G. Madhava Rao of the                            
              Structural Engineering Research Centre (SERC), in Madras,                      
              India.  Proceedings including the presented papers and                         
              poster papers is expected to be published.                                     
                                                                                             
              Scope:  This is the first international meeting in the area   of               
              fatigue and fracture in steel and concrete structures to   be                  
              held in India, and is attracting wide response from many                       
              countries.  There are over 110 papers already submitted for                    
              presentation.  The SERC is India's best known research                         
              institute in the field.  It has excellent facilities for                       
              research and for the meeting arrangement.  The proposed                        
              U.S. participants are  eminent scholars in the field.  They                    
              are likely to contribute well to the symposium and to gain                     
              from their participation.  It is also likely that future   joint               
              projects will be identified.  This project fits the   objectives               
              of the US-India Program.
