Abstract    :
              From satellite images to elementary school textbooks, our                      
              everyday life is full of information presented in the form of                  
              images. Since so much information is in non-alphanumeric form, as              
              a natural extension of the ideas in databases, researchers                     
              started exploring the design and implementation of image                       
              databases. The progress in this area requires close interaction                
              among researchers from disparate areas of computer science and                 
              other fields. To bring together active researchers in databases,               
              object-oriented systems, image and signal processing, multi-                   
              media, and other related areas a workshop will be organized. In                
              addition to the researchers in the above and related areas, a few              
              researchers and practitioners interested in applying these                     
              systems in industry, health-care, global change and other areas                
              will be invited. The practitioners will provide input into the                 
              discussion to guarantee that useful systems will be designed by                
              researchers and practitioners working in this emerging area. The               
              participants will be drawn from academic institutions, research                
              centers, Government, and industry.  The report of the workshop                 
              will be submitted to NSF and will be widely publicized.  The                   
              report will identify major research areas that should be                       
              addressed by researchers for designing user-friendly visual                    
              information management systems suitable for a wide range of                    
              application domains.
