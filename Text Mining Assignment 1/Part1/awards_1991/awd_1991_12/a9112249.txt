Abstract    :
              Necessary components will be purchased to construct an ultrasonic              
              resonance spectrometer.  The equipment will be used for several                
              research projects involving the evaluation of the mechanical                   
              properties of materials, particularly the elastic constants.                   
                                                                                             
              The intended use of the apparatus is to measure the resonant                   
              frequencies of free vibration of materials of very small size that             
              have been manufactured or already exist in the shape of a                      
              parallelepiped, a sphere, or a cylinder.  Using numerical                      
              techniques that are currently being developed, approximations to               
              these frequencies are also evaluated using the theory of                       
              elasticity.  By comparing the measured frequencies with the                    
              calculated frequencies and minimizing the difference between these             
              values, optimal estimates can be obtained for the elastic                      
              constants.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              The measurements system will allow a wealth of material studies to             
              be completed and can be used to study any solid: metal, ceramic,               
              semiconductor, polymer, composite, and so on.  Other uses include              
              the effects of temperature and pressure on the elastic constants,              
              general structural vibration studies, and internal friction                    
              measurements.  The system possesses both scientific and practical              
              potentials, and will provide the opportunity to establish a new                
              standard method for measuring material properties.
