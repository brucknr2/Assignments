Abstract    :
              The objective of this work is to                                               
              derive the theoretical and                                                     
              numerical tools necessary for the                                              
              development of computer algorithms                                             
              for image reconstruction from cone-                                            
              beam projections which are                                                     
              computationally efficient and                                                  
              accurate.  In particular four tasks                                            
              will be addressed.  First, rigorous                                            
              proofs of the reconstruction                                                   
              formulas derived formally in the                                               
              preliminary research will be made.                                             
              The rigorous proofs will give more                                             
              credence to these formulas,                                                    
              possibly eliminate any oversights                                              
              made in the formal derivations, and                                            
              will result in a better conceptual                                             
              understanding of the formulas                                                  
              involved.  Developing the rigorous                                             
              proofs will also provide a strong                                              
              background for another task to be
