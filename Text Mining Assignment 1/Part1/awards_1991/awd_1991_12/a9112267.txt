Abstract    :
              Existing computational models of structure-from-motion are based               
              on variations of optical flow or feature point correspondences                 
              within the interior of single objects.  This project investigates              
              a new, boundary-based cue for determining motion and shape.  An                
              approach is outlined for determining that an object is rotating                
              in depth.  Only simple, qualitative computations are required,                 
              avoiding the need to accurately determine how flow patterns are                
              varying over the surface of interest.  Generalizations involving               
              integration of boundary and surface cues will be explored.                     
              Ultimately, the approach will be extended to other types of                    
              motion such as translation of a wide field-of-view cameras.To                  
              support this boundary-based analysis improved methods will be                  
              evaluated for estimating optical flow in the presence of flow                  
              discontinuities.  The proposed algorithm integrates flow/surface               
              analysis with the structure-from-motion determination while                    
              addressing certain deficiencies in previously proposed                         
              techniques.  Results from this study should provide more general               
              reliable, and economical methods for dealing with the important                
              problems involved in analyzing visual motion.
