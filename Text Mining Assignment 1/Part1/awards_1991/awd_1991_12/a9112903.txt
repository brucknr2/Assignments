Abstract    :
                   Computer simulations will be carried out which will                       
              provide models for laboratory experiments designed to measure                  
              the Fokker-Planck coefficients in a fully ionized plasma.                      
              Attention will be focused on the modeling of diffusion                         
              processes and computer codes for plasma simulations will be                    
              used to model various initial conditions.  The modeling will                   
              be extended during later phases of the research to include two                 
              and three dimensional studies.
