Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Until the difficulty and tedium of the experimental method is                  
              reduced, the surface forces apparatus will remain a tool in                    
              the hands of a few dedicated specialists rather than a                         
              mainstay technique in colloid and interface science.  Fifteen                  
              years after its development, researchers continue to measure                   
              the positions, and thereby wavelengths, of the low intensity                   
              interference fringes by eye; a process that takes at least six                 
              months of practice to master, as it must be, if surface                        
              separation is to be determined accurately and precisely to                     
              within one angstrom.  Even then, the resolution of the                         
              measurement is ultimately limited by the physical abilities                    
              and stamina of the researcher.  In this proposal, we request                   
              funds to develop a high perfomance imaging and control system                  
              for the surface apparatus that provides for automation of the                  
              force measurement with resolution greater than currently                       
              possible.  The system will be used in conjunction with our                     
              surface forces apparatus to investigate the structure and                      
              stability of ultrathin organic films.
