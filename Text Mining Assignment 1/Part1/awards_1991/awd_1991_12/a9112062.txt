Abstract    :
              We propose to develop two new operational modes of x-ray                       
              microscopes which will make use of phase contrast for imaging                  
              thick, hydrated biological specimens with 60 nm or better                      
              resolution.  Compared to current to current x-ray microscopes                  
              which use absorption contrast, phase contrast microscopes offer                
              the promise of higher intrinsic contrast at certain wavelengths                
              and thus reduced radiation dose, plus the possibility of improved              
              penetration and depth of field for thick specimens.  A                         
              Holographic Phase Contrast X-ray Microscope will be developed                  
              which will use a photoresist detector to record with high spatial              
              resolution the interference pattern between a reference wave and               
              a wave which has undergone amplitude and phase changes by passage              
              through the specimen; the complex specimen wave will be recovered              
              by numerical hologram reconstruction.  A Differential Phase                    
              Contrast X-ray Microscope will be developed which will use a                   
              Fresnel zone plate to form a focusses x-ray spot through which a               
              sample is scanned, and which will use an optical lever detector                
              to measure refractive index gradients as well as x-ray absorption              
              in the sample.  Operation of these microscopes will be verified                
              by imaging test objects, and then their operation will be                      
              demonstrated using a variety of hydrated and unsectioned                       
              biological specimens.
