Abstract    :
              The research proposed here concerns the properties of two classes              
              of physical systems:  flux-line arrays in type II superconductors              
              and complex classical liquids.  The work on flux-line arrays mainly            
              focuses on equilibrium and dynamical properties of flux-line                   
              liquids, with the object to make contact with experiments.  The                
              work on liquids aims to gain a better understanding of the role of             
              compositional disorder and orientation correlations in governing               
              the structural relaxation in dense fluids.  This will be achieved              
              by studying specific model systems, namely hard sphere mixtures and            
              rod models for nematics.
