Abstract    :
              This proposal for doctoral dissertation research examines the                  
              technology and social organization of Greenlandic whaling, the                 
              interpenetration of cash and subsistence sectors in local                      
              economies, and the impact of dynamic whaling regulatory regimes on             
              Greenlandic hunters.  The International Whaling Commission's                   
              reduction of minke whale harvests has had a considerable impact on             
              Greenlandic communities.  The Greenlandic situation is typical of              
              the conflicts between Inuit communities, and other subsistence-                
              based societies in the Arctic, and the interests of environmental              
              protection organizations and development concerns.  Although                   
              critics have challenged the validity of traditional Inuit whaling              
              and emphasized the emergence of internal markets, the Greenlanders             
              argue for the cultural and socioeconomic significance of whaling               
              and its sustainability.  The present research seeks to understand              
              the articulation and contradiction between Inuit and Euroamerican              
              perspectives about the use of natural resources and sustainable                
              development in the circumpolar north.  The project draws upon                  
              theoretical and methodological approaches derived from political               
              economics and natural resources anthropology.
