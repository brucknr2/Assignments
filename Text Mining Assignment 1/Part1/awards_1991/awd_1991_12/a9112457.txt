Abstract    :
              The project goal is to procure a real time data acquisition and                
              active control system to support several research projects,                    
              including (1) vibration control of flexible structures using                   
              imbedded fiber optic sensors, (2) deployment dynamics of a                     
              flexible spacecraft, (3) multi axis rotational control of                      
              flexible spacecraft, and (4) the effects of damping on the                     
              performance of controlled structures.  The equipment will also                 
              enhance the education of undergraduate and graduate students in                
              aerospace engineering.
