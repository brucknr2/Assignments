Abstract    :
              The Division of Engineering at Brown University will                           
              purchase femtosecond laser equipment under this                                
              NSF Engineering Research Equipment Grant which                                 
              will be dedicated to support research in engineering.                          
              The laser equipment will be used to support several                            
              research projects, including in particular time-resolved                       
              optical spectroscopy of semiconductor nanostructures.                          
              The work includes wide-bandgap semiconductor                                   
              materials which are being developed for                                        
              optoelectronic applications at short visible                                   
              wavelengths as well as heterostructures in which two-                          
              dimensional and lower dimensional electrons are of                             
              high mobility.  The ultrafast optical techniques made                          
              possible by this laser instrumentation will enable the                         
              tracking of electronic excitations in small                                    
              semiconductor structures on a scale of a few nm in                             
              real time.
