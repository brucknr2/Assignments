Abstract    :
              An ion chromatograph is to be purchased with this Research                     
              Equipment Grant to support three different projects in the                     
              Chemistry and Chemical Engineering Departments.  The purpose                   
              of the first project is to identify and quantify the metal                     
              species that exist as a result of thermal degradation of                       
              hazardous waste.  In the second, high performance ion                          
              chromatography will be investigated as an analytical tool for                  
              characterizing cyanide bearing waste.  A third application is                  
              to the evaluation of the concentration and speciation of                       
              metals and other substances such as cyanide in the tailings at                 
              abandoned mining sites, and to assess the leachability of                      
              hazardous chemicals from the site.                                             
                                                                                             
              Heavy metals such as leaf, mercury and arsenic pose a serious                  
              hazard to human health if they become concentrated in drinking                 
              water or the food chain.  An ion chromatograph has the ability                 
              to separate mixtures of cations and anions, free and                           
              complexed, providing a way to characterize the chemical state,                 
              and thus the desirability, of specific heavy metals present in                 
              a waste stream.
