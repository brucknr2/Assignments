Abstract    :
              This is an award to provide support for purchase of                            
              engineering research equipment to permit study of                              
              anaerobic decomposition of municipal solid waste.  The                         
              equipment to be purchased with this support consists of a                      
              refuse shredder and a high-speed liquid chromatograph                          
              system.  This equipment will be used on several research                       
              projects involving management of municipal solid wastes                        
              including studies of the inhibition of solid waste                             
              decomposition in sanitary landfills, techniques to enhance                     
              methane production from refuse, fate of hazardous wastes                       
              in landfills and the biodegradative characteristics of                         
              individual components of municipal solid wastes.                               
                                                                                             
              The proposal leading to this award was submitted in                            
              response to the Program Announcement and Guidelines NSF                        
              90-146, Research Equipment Grant Program.  Results are                         
              expected to provide guidance for engineering design of                         
              alternative processes and systems to manage solid wastes                       
              to placement in landfills.
