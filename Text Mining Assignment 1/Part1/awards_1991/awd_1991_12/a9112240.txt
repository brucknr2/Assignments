Abstract    :
                   This research in theoretical gravitational physics                        
              concerns the problem of quantum gravity and is directed                        
              primarily at the question "is the usual continuum model of                     
              spacetime appropriate in a theory uniting quantum physics and                  
              gravitation and, if not, by what should it be replaced?"                       
                   Several facets of this subject will be investigated by                    
              Dr. Jacobson:                                                                  
                   1)   application of the partial solution of the                           
                        constraint problem in general relativity to the                      
                        standard recipe for quantization of gravity;                         
                   2)   the compatibility of black hole radiation with                       
                        different assumptions about short distance spacetime                 
                        structure;                                                           
                   3)   the problem of defining cutoff quantum field theory                  
                        in time-dependent spacetime geometries;                              
                   4)   constraining relations in causal networks and                        
                        classification of allowed network structures;                        
                   5)   the role of closed timelike curves in 2 + 1                          
                        dimensional quantum gravity;                                         
                   6)   the problem of interpreting the formalism of quantum                 
                        gravity in the absence of an external notion of                      
                        time.
