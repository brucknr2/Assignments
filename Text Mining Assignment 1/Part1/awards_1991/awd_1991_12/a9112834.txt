Abstract    :
                   An integral component of the multi-agency U.S. Global Change              
              Research Program (Our Changing Planet," Committee on Earth                     
              Sciences, 1991) is understanding and modeling the geospace                     
              environment.  As part of its contribution to the U.S. Global                   
              Change  Research Program, the National Science Foundation's                    
              Division of Atmospheric Sciences has established a new research                
              initiative,  Geospace Environment Modeling (GEM), with the goal                
              of supporting basic research into the dynamical and structural                 
              properties of geospace, leading to the construction of a global                
              geospace model with predictive capability.                                     
                   The subjects of the first GEM campaign are the                            
              magnetospheric boundary, the magnetosheath beyond it, and the                  
              connection from the boundary through the magnetosphere to the                  
              ionosphere.  The cusp region is a rich source of ULF waves                     
              spanning the frequency spectrum from near dc to above 1Hz.  This               
              is a grant to study the ULF wave spectrum at cusp stations in                  
              conjugate hemisphere in order to investigate the conjugacy of the              
              cusp at these sites and to identify wave generation mechanisms                 
              associated with the cusp.
