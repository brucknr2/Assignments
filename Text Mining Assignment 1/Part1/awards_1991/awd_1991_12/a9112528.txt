Abstract    :
                   A user mode research program will be carried out in                       
              photonuclear reactions on few-body systems.  The experimental                  
              work will be carried out at the University of Saskatchewan                     
              electron linac and pulse stretcher ring, and will make use of                  
              a large acceptance charged hadron spectrometer and a mono-                     
              energetic beam of gamma rays.  Results will lead to improved                   
              understanding of the structure of light nuclei, and our                        
              ability to predict properties of such systems based on the                     
              latest nucleon-nucleon potentials.  Equipment development,                     
              simulations, data analysis, and interpretation will be carried                 
              out at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University.
