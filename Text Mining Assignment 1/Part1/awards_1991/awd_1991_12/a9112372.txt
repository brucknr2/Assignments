Abstract    :
              The Department of Electrical and Computer                                      
              Engineering at the University of California at San                             
              Diego (UCSD) will purchase a 2200/1s                                           
              turbomolecular pump and its backing pump for the                               
              gas-source molecular-beam-epitaxy (GSMBE)                                      
              system which is dedicated to support research in                               
              engineering.  The expected increase in wafer                                   
              throughput of the GSMBE system, with addition of                               
              a turbomolecular pump, will benefit many research                              
              projects, some of which are listed.  1) Physics and                            
              technologies of pseudomorphic heterostructures                                 
              containing phosphorus.  2) Optoelectronic devices                              
              based on (In,Ga)(As,P)/InP heterostructures. 3)                                
              Multiple quantum well light modulators for optical                             
              computing (GaAs on Si with GaP/GaAsP/GaAs                                      
              intermediate layers). 4) Advanced heterojunction                               
              bipolar transistors with phosphorus-containing                                 
              materials. 5) Growth and characterization of                                   
              InGaP/GaAs heterostructures for field-effect                                   
              transistors. 6) High-temperature (A1,Ga)P/Gap                                  
              heterojunction bipolar transistors.
