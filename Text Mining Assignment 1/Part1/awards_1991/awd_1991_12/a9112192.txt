Abstract    :
              An experimental project is proposed to investigate                             
              laser-assisted layer epitaxy (LALE) for the selective                          
              area deposition of InGaAsP/InP based                                           
              optoelectronic devices.  Demonstration of the                                  
              LALE process for the selective area deposition of                              
              InGaAsP/InP heterstructures could revolutionize                                
              the methods currently used to grow and fabricate                               
              these devices.  Current fabrication techniques for                             
              optoelectronic integrated circuits (OEICs) involve                             
              several epitaxial growth runs and processing                                   
              sequences.  On the other hand, LALE would                                      
              provide a spatially controlled epitaxial process to                            
              grow OEICs in a single growth run.  TO date, no                                
              research has been conducted on LALE in the                                     
              InGaAsP/InP materials system, which is playing an                              
              every increasing role in optical communication and                             
              photonic integrated circuits.  The principal objective                         
              of this project is to demonstrate the LALE of                                  
              InGaAs and InGaAsP in a metalorganic chemical                                  
              vapor deposition system (MOCVD).
