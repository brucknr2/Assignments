Abstract    :
              This proposal requests funding to search for and study fossils of              
              early land animals in North America.  The time intervals to be                 
              studied are the Silurian and Devonian Periods, spanning from about             
              440 million years ago to about 360 million years ago.  The fossils             
              are of arachnids (spiders, etc.), myriapods (centipeds and                     
              millipeds), and insects as well as a few groups of animals that are            
              entirely extinct.  The fossils are preserved as organic remains in             
              sedimentary rocks and are removed by digesting the rocks with                  
              hydrofluoric acid.  The material obtained in this way will aid in              
              understanding the evolution of early life on land, the                         
              relationships within and among the groups named, and how these                 
              early animals functioned.
