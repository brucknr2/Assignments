Abstract    :
              Partial funding is provided for the acquisition of a two-station               
              thin film X-ray diffractometer for the study of synthesized                    
              polycrystalline and epitaxial thin films.  The equipment will be               
              part of a central facility which performs general structural                   
              characterization for a large number of research projects in surface            
              engineering, tribology and micromachining.
