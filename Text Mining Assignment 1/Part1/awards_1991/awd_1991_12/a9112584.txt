Abstract    :
              The PI will study the metabolism of fructose in two species of                 
              plants, known commonly as thistle and dandelion.  These plant store            
              carbohydrate as fructans, and knowledge of the metabolism could be             
              of considerable use in controlling their contamination of range-               
              and cropland.  The research is an extension of the PI's graduate               
              experience and would be of considerable benefit to allow the PI to             
              focus on a project which could funded by the USDA, state Ag funds,             
              and NSF programs.  The planning period is of great merit to further            
              the career plans of the PI.  It is designed to be partly a post-               
              doctoral, and collaborative interaction with scientists who may                
              very favorably impact upon the PI's development.
