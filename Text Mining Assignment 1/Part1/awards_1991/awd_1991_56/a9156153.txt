Abstract    :
              The objective of this proposal is to improve the undergraduate                 
              statistical education of engineers by integrating statistics                   
              into their laboratories and courses.  In this way statistical                  
              thinking and techniques are being reinforced after an                          
              introductory statistics course, with the expectation that in                   
              this way students will retain their statistical skills. The                    
              goal is to create a course that engineering faculty will want                  
              their students to take, and that will prepare the students for                 
              what will be required of them in their labs and courses.
