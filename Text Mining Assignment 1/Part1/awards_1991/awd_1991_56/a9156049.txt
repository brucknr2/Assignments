Abstract    :
              An introductory undergraduate course in biomechanics and                       
              computer graphics is being developed, geared toward enhancing                  
              general computer literacy with regards to human motion                         
              modeling.  A course goal is to encourage students to assume                    
              responsibility for their intellectual development through                      
              active learning and independent investigation.  With both a                    
              lecture and laboratory component, the course emphasizes the                    
              analytical development of kinematic models, the acquisition of                 
              kinematic data with laboratory experiments and the use of                      
              computer graphics techniques for human motion rendering.  An                   
              educational software tool, Biomechanica, is being developed as                 
              a multipurpose dynamic simulation program with a user-friendly                 
              programming interface.   The personal computer is an                           
              inexpensive medium for educating our future engineers,                         
              scientists, and medical practitioners about the physiological                  
              capabilities of the human body.  The use of computer graphics                  
              in biomechanics usually occurs at the graduate level.  This                    
              course and software development effort make these topics                       
              accessible to lower division students.
