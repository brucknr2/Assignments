Abstract    :
              In response to the perceived need to improve the quality of                    
              science instruction and the public's scientific literacy, a                    
              model introductory course sequence is being developed as part                  
              of a new comprehensive undergraduate Program in Environmental                  
              Science and Policy.  An integrated series of "magnet' courses                  
              for undergraduates is being created that consists of freshman                  
              seminars, which will broaden opportunities for the non-major                   
              and major alike, and a new one-semester introductory course                    
              based on case studies, which will provide a more interactive                   
              entry into science.  Graduate and undergraduate students are                   
              participating in the development of both types of courses and                  
              testing their efficacy, and the effort is being evaluated by an                
              outside consultant.  The new comprehensive program will serve                  
              as an important model for the further development of the entire                
              science curriculum, both for the non-major and major.
