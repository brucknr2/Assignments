Abstract    :
              This project focuses substantial resources on a small set of                   
              highly capable first-year students to inspire a greater                        
              fraction of them to pursue research careers in science and                     
              engineering.  Chemistry is the ideal course for this because                   
              most science and engineering majors take it in their first                     
              year; physics and engineering courses begin later.  In 1990-91,                
              we developed an intensive first-year chemistry course for 40 of                
              the very best new students in a class of 5000.  The course                     
              introduces state-of-the-art chemical thought as early and as                   
              often as possible.  The cornerstone of the course is the Spring                
              research project, in which pairs of students engage in hands-on                
              research in the laboratories of chemistry professors.  Student                 
              response to the course was overwhelmingly positive.  Eleven of                 
              the 25 students who participated planned to continue research                  
              projects this Fall.  This project will enhance the research                    
              experience and the laboratories.  This model course may                        
              convince other universities to focus more resources on the very                
              best science and engineering students in the critical first                    
              year.
