Abstract    :
              A two-semester introductory sequence for computer science majors is            
              being developed with equal emphasis on programming, mathematical               
              analysis, and experimentation, along with the supporting                       
              mathematics.  This sequence teaches the three topics concurrently              
              and provides a rigorous foundation so that students can practice               
              programming, analysis and experimentation immediately and continue             
              throughout the curriculum.  The courses concentrate on developing              
              mastery of the three foundations of computer science rather than on            
              surveying various sub-fields of the discipline.
