Abstract    :
              Incorporation of interfaced computers into laboratories                        
              nationwide has been slow because no coherent and easily                        
              adaptable package of experimental procedures exists that shows                 
              educators how to use the new technology successfully.  A                       
              complete laboratory curriculum package will be developed for                   
              general chemistry that uses the MSU interface and computer                     
              hardware and software.  The package will facilitate relevant                   
              and meaningful experimentation by adding a number of new and                   
              improved procedures, including some simulation as an adjunct to                
              lab work, including tutorials in support of laboratory                         
              instruction, and being made adaptable for use in diverse                       
              educational settings from the community college to doctoral                    
              institutions.  Implementation of the curriculum package at the                 
              eight institutions in the project consortium will directly                     
              benefit nearly 13,500 general chemistry students over five                     
              years. Dissemination to the whole country is expected.
