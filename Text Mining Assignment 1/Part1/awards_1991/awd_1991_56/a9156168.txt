Abstract    :
              The primary objectives of this project are to promote students'                
              interest in manufacturing engineering at an early stage in the                 
              engineering curriculum, and to increase the retention rate of                  
              engineering majors.  Two sophomore-level courses in design and                 
              manufacturing are being developed.  These courses provide an                   
              integrated body of knowledge designed around the manufacture of                
              a product.  Once the courses are developed, they will be                       
              implemented in the Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering                    
              Program at Oregon State University.  Additional project                        
              objectives include: a plan to revise junior-senior curriculum                  
              around the fundamental design and manufacturing principles                     
              developed in the two new courses, and dissemination of results                 
              through short courses to community colleges in the Oregon State                
              System of Education.
