Abstract    :
              D-Q University is developing  and testing new strategies,                      
              curricula, teaching modalities, student tutorials, and course                  
              review approaches which will use Native American history and                   
              culture to make accessible and heighten interest in mathematics                
              and computer science. Through the use of culturally-sensitive                  
              content and an inter-disciplinary approach to instruction, D-Q                 
              U will develop instructional materials emphasizing Native                      
              American cultural content for two new classes, develop                         
              curriculum and motivational materials suitable for all schools                 
              with Native American enrollment or an interest in the content                  
              of historical Native American science. Project Connection can                  
              serve as the bridge connecting American Indians to mathematics,                
              research methods, and the environmental sciences. The project                  
              may serve as a model for use with other ethnic or racial                       
              groups.
