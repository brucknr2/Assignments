Abstract    :
              Dynamic visualization materials will be developed to enhance                   
              student comprehension of dynamic molecular processes, and the                  
              interrelationship of macroscopic phenomena and abstract                        
              concepts and models.  The materials also will accelerate                       
              student integration of the various ways chemical phenomena are                 
              represented -- macroscopic, mathematical, graphical, and                       
              molecular. The project focuses on topics that lend themselves                  
              to graphical and animation techniques, the main subjects being                 
              chemical equilibrium, solutions, stoichiometry, single atom and                
              molecule descriptions, and pure substances.  The materials will                
              run on microcomputers.  Included will be lecture tool units for                
              faculty use and lecture amplification and topic tutorial units                 
              for student use.  The materials will be used and evaluated by                  
              faculty and students at other institutions.  These materials                   
              will be especially beneficial for students with poor science                   
              and mathematical backgrounds or those with weak communication                  
              skills.
