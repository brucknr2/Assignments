Abstract    :
              Four faculty of the Willamette University Chemistry Department                 
              have created a core first semester course that stresses the                    
              concepts central to modern chemistry.  They will develop a                     
              case-study approach for the second semester that examines in                   
              detail the material from the first semester by using specific                  
              phenomena to illustrate chemical principles.  The case-studies                 
              will be selected on the basis of student interest and societal                 
              relevance. Students in the present Introductory Chemistry                      
              course and in the new, innovative one will be surveyed to                      
              assess the effectiveness of the new approach.  Although this                   
              case-study approach will be tailored to meet the needs of                      
              students in the Chemistry Program at Willamette University, it                 
              can easily be adapted for effective use in introductory                        
              chemistry courses elsewhere.
