Abstract    :
              Introductory Biology is being revised to make it a more                        
              creative, engaging, and participatory experience for both                      
              potential majors and for non-majors.  The intention is to                      
              strengthen student interest in Biology by designing an exciting                
              and more realistic new course.  The new lab format will involve                
              doing real laboratory experiments and learning real research                   
              skills such as experimental design and data analysis.  The                     
              students work in small groups that use the 'PI system' and                     
              write group lab reports modeled on the writing of a scientific                 
              paper.  Students who take the revised course will have a                       
              clearer grasp of how laboratory science is actually done and                   
              will have first-hand knowledge about such key ideas as                         
              hypothesis creation and testing, data collection and                           
              interpretation, and scientific writing.  This experimental                     
              course is being compared with the current introductory biology                 
              course by a team of evaluators from other institutions.
