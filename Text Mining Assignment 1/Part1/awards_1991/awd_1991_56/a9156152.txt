Abstract    :
              A graphical software environment is to be developed for use as                 
              a teaching tool in an introductory kinematics classroom,                       
              allowing the instructor to do everything on the projected                      
              graphics-screen that is currently done on the blackboard for                   
              planar mechanisms.  Unlike the backboard, the software will                    
              have the intelligence to interpret the drawings in a kinematic                 
              sense, so that the drawing of the linkage will behave as a                     
              linkage.  All constructions based on a linkage will be directly                
              associated with the linkage, even as the linkage moves to its                  
              next position.  Simulation of motion is a valuable component of                
              this tool; the more far-reaching aspect is the ability to                      
              demonstrate every kinematic principle for any plane linkage at                 
              any time.  The kinematically intelligent blackboard will                       
              provide an environment in which all topics and principles can                  
              be integrated, a departure from the typical modular approach to                
              teaching kinematics. A unique sketching method has been                        
              developed which allows practically any planar linkage to be                    
              intuitively sketched on the graphic screen in a matter of                      
              seconds. Eventually, the software environment will be                          
              integrated with audio and visual input to allow the kinematic                  
              sketch to overlay images of actual hardware, such as from a                    
              videotape.
