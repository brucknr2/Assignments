Abstract    :
              A fundamentally new course on electricity and magnetism is                     
              being developed.  The goal of the course is to teach students                  
              a unified approach to reasoning qualitatively about a wide                     
              variety of electrical and magnetic interactions.  The students                 
              then use this approach in the process of solving both                          
              qualitative and quantitative problems. The qualitative work is                 
              based on the physics of the basic Coulomb interaction and of                   
              the atomic structure of matter. This is done initially without                 
              the use of secondary concepts such as electric field, electric                 
              potential, and Kirchhoff's rules. There is a heavy emphasis on                 
              teaching students how to construct rigorous, qualitative                       
              explanations of physical phenomena, including how to construct                 
              and use good diagrams as tools for both reasoning and                          
              explaining. Experimental work is central to the course, but                    
              does not require special laboratory sessions.  Students work                   
              collaboratively in the lecture hall on desktop experiments in                  
              electrostatics and DC circuits, and on the unified analysis of                 
              these experiments, including circuits, in terms of the basic                   
              Coulomb interaction and of the atomic structure of matter. The                 
              fundamental physical understanding that results from this                      
              qualitative work is the foundation for the more traditional and                
              more quantitative material that forms the remainder of the                     
              course.  Instructional materials are being created and refined,                
              and are being used evaluate in detail the effect of instruction                
              on the reasoning and problem-solving processes of students.
