Abstract    :
              Multimedia laboratory software modules for a freshman-level                    
              non-major science course entitled "The Age of Dinosaurs" is                    
              being developed.  This course enrolls several thousand students                
              annually at over 20 U.S. colleges and universities.  The                       
              modules include high resolution, photographic-quality color                    
              images, 3-dimensional models, animations, sound, and text,                     
              coupled together with 'hyperlinks' to afford users easy access                 
              to all levels of remedial, basic, and supplementary                            
              information.  These modules are being published on CD-ROM                      
              suitable for use on both Macintosh and MS/DOS computers.
