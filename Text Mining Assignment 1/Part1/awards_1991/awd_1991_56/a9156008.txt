Abstract    :
              This project develops the first-year courses in computer                       
              science centered around program derivation methodology in the                  
              believe that formal mathematical methods, such as program                      
              derivation methodology, provide part of the solution to the                    
              problem of software reliability.  The derivation methodology                   
              provides techniques for "calculating" programs which probably                  
              satisfy their specifications.  This project will adapt, extend,                
              and improve the methodology so that it is taught effectively to                
              freshmen.  Skills acquired by students in these first-year                     
              courses will make possible a higher level of instruction and                   
              student work in advanced courses.  The new first-year courses                  
              are the foundation for a revised computing curriculum at                       
              Southwestern University demonstrating the feasibility and                      
              desirability of an undergraduate computing curriculum based on                 
              formal mathematical methods.
