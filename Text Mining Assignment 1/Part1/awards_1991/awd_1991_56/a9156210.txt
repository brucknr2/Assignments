Abstract    :
              The overall goal of this project is a radical restructuring of                 
              undergraduate computing education, beginning with a one-year                   
              introductory computing curriculum.  The aim of this pilot                      
              project is to construct a database of two problem case studies                 
              to be used in three quarters, or two semesters, of courses in                  
              the algorithms and programming area.  The case studies                         
              integrate the teaching of theory, abstraction, design,                         
              implementation, and experimentation into a new core curriculum                 
              for undergraduates from a growing community of disciplines.                    
              Each case study is complete in that it contains instruction in                 
              all topics relevant to its problem, as well as exercises and                   
              laboratory manuals to support the implementation and                           
              experimentation components.  The database is integrated with                   
              information processing tools appropriate for supporting ongoing                
              competence tracking, optimization targeting, and module                        
              refinement.  Empirical evaluation plays a key role in the                      
              project, and ongoing effectiveness evaluation is built into the                
              curriculum design.
