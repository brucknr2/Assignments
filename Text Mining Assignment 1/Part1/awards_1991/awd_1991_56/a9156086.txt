Abstract    :
              Mathematics educators, through the NCTM Standards and MAA                      
              Professional Standards for Teachers of Mathematics, call for                   
              more active learning at all levels of mathematics education.                   
              This project is developing a teaching approach for the finite                  
              mathematics course, taken by elementary education and business                 
              majors, which implements the goals of these standards in both                  
              curriculum and instruction. The course materials incorporate                   
              active and collaborative learning techniques, writing, and a                   
              problem-solving approach which emphasizes critical thinking.                   
              The software keep the structure of SEEN, an award-winning                      
              humanities software program, with tutorials that teach                         
              mathematical strategies plus a bulletin board that encourages                  
              peer collaboration.  The SEEN-MATH software is being written so                
              that the tutorial inculcates Polya's problem-solving model with                
              tools such as graphing and calculator capabilities.  In                        
              addition, to train and retrain mathematics teachers, thus                      
              affecting the educational infrastructure, SEEN-MATH is being                   
              used with elementary education and secondary mathematics                       
              education majors, and presented in an in-service workshops for                 
              teachers, allowing them to use the Polya tutorial and also                     
              adapt the software (in its author mode) to their students and                  
              classes as a model of active learning.
