Abstract    :
              Rensselaer is developing a series of cross-disciplinary                        
              activities at the science/computer interface for use in the                    
              basic science courses at Rensselaer and other universities.                    
              These materials will allow the introductory courses in                         
              mathematics, physics, chemistry, computer science, engineering,                
              and earth/environmental science to reinforce one another                       
              through shared topics and activities. The materials will also                  
              have the effect of encouraging the instructors of the                          
              introductory courses to work more closely together than has, in                
              the past, been traditional at most universities. The materials                 
              to be developed will include text materials, computer based                    
              problem-solving materials, simulations, microcomputer based                    
              laboratory activities, and video materials. These materials for                
              topics relating to nonlinear phenomena are being developed as                  
              a first step toward full implementation and as a demonstration                 
              of the feasibility of this approach.                                           
                                                                                             
              The project centers on use of these workstations in university                 
              level freshman and sophomore courses. It rests on a major                      
              university initiative: the 4500 undergraduates have unlimited                  
              access to 500 state-of-the-art scientific workstations. Of                     
              these, over 320 are earmarked for the exclusive use in freshman                
              and sophomore courses. Rensselaer is preparing to educate                      
              students in the basic sciences at the science/computer                         
              interface. The structures of existing courses are being                        
              modified in order to allow students to confront developing                     
              interface technologies. These include nonlinear modeling,                      
              scientific computation, statistics, geometric modeling, and                    
              algorithm issues, each from a multidisciplinary vantage point.                 
              Nonlinear modeling has been selected as the initial project.
