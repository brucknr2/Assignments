Abstract    :
              The members of the Mathematics, Statistics, and Computation                    
              Department at Mount Holyoke College are initiating a four-year                 
              project aimed at creating an entry level mathematics curriculum                
              which will serve all students.  At the end of the four year                    
              project, a curriculum with a variety of attractive entry level                 
              courses and a number of parallel tracks leading to a mathematics               
              minor will be developed.  These minors are being designed to supply            
              a coherent set of intellectual tools which will form a basis for               
              further study, both in mathematics and in other disciplines.  This             
              new curriculum will have much more flexibility in allowing students            
              with weak backgrounds to pursue scientific careers and will,                   
              ultimately, lead to a larger number of students electing to major              
              in mathematics.  It will also better serve students who go on to               
              nontechnical careers.
