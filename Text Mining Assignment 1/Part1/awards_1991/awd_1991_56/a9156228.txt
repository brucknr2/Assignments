Abstract    :
              The CUPLE Consortium has produced a prototype of new                           
              instructional resource for college and university physics                      
              courses.  CUPLE is comprehensive because it draws on innovative                
              developments in classroom, laboratory, lecture demonstration,                  
              computational physics, videodiscs, and computer-based materials                
              that have been developed by outstanding physics educators from                 
              all over the country.  It is unified because it combines these                 
              materials in a delivery system that is based on a hypertext                    
              multimedia environment that presents a consistent user                         
              interface to the students and faculty, eliminating the need for                
              the user to learn the idiosyncrasies of many different systems.                
                                                                                             
              The prototype system includes all of the tools necessary for                   
              the complete system, including data acquisition for                            
              microcomputer-based laboratories (MBL), student problem-solving                
              through program construction (M.U.P.P.E.T. and WinPhys),                       
              integration of video into computer displays (including the                     
              ability to make measurements on screen), spreadsheet physics                   
              materials, and a hypermedia authoring system that pulls all of                 
              these tools together in an environment that allows faculty (or                 
              students) to develop new materials using these tools without                   
              the need to resort to sophisticated programming.  This project                 
              is extending that system to additional content areas, is                       
              enlarging class testing of the system at cooperating                           
              universities, is using the results of class testing and the                    
              ongoing technical beta testing to further refine the materials                 
              and tools.  The project is also developing the browser and                     
              class design tools necessary to allow faculty to design custom                 
              courses.
