Abstract    :
              This project focuses on the development of an undergraduate                    
              course designed to familiarize students, including both science                
              majors and general education students interested in science and                
              the information professions, with the rapidly accumulating body                
              of recorded scientific knowledge, with an emphasis on its                      
              infrastructure, processes for introducing new knowledge,                       
              methods of access, and evaluation.  The first phase of the                     
              project will involve consultation with both research and                       
              teaching faculty at the Univerisity of Illinois in a variety of                
              disciplines, in order to gather data on the sources of                         
              information used by specific research communities and to                       
              establish the range of educational needs in the science and                    
              general education curricula.  The syllabus development stage of                
              the project will include the preparation of a volume of case                   
              materials, creation of laboratory exercises in information                     
              retrieval, and a survey of the relevant literature.  This                      
              course is designed to dispel traditional stereotypes of                        
              information storage, enhance student's appreciation for the                    
              creation and application of scientific knowledge, increase                     
              sensitivity to issues of policy and ethics, and provide                        
              practical experience in locating and accessing a wide variety                  
              of information sources.
