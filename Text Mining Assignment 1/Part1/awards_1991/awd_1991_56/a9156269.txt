Abstract    :
              Introductory biology students, especially those with poor                      
              academic preparation, are often simultaneously overwhelmed and                 
              bored by the amount of information they are expected to                        
              assimilate.  Students' confusion and discontent stem in part                   
              from their inability to perceive the structure underlying the                  
              discipline and in part from their lack of engagement with the                  
              subject matter.  To address these problem a two-semester                       
              introductory sequence for biology majors is being developed,                   
              which has a strong thematic base and a highly visible                          
              scaffolding to assist students in constructing their own                       
              knowledge frameworks.  A major objective is to lay the                         
              foundation for continued education in biology.  In each                        
              laboratory unit being developed a single theme, such as Energy                 
              Input, Uses of Energy, or Information processing, is                           
              investigated at different levels of organization (molecular,                   
              cell, structural, organismal, ecological) and with different                   
              types of organisms.  Each unit includes activities of varying                  
              complexity, structure, and leeway for student inquiry.                         
              Students choose from among the available activities and design                 
              their own experiments, and work cooperatively in small groups.
