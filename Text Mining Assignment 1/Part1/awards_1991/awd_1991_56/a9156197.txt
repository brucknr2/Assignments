Abstract    :
              Ithaca College science faculty are developing laboratory                       
              courses for non-science majors, each of which will emphasize a                 
              theme or topic of wide interest such as the environment or                     
              physiological bases of fitness. Each set of laboratory                         
              experiences will be an integral component in a sequence of                     
              courses for the non-major. In each laboratory course advanced                  
              undergraduate majors will function as "experts" to guide                       
              student teams in their investigations.  Active learning will be                
              increased by requiring students to carry out informal writing                  
              assignments in each lecture-laboratory sequence. Students who                  
              complete the sequences will have limited but genuine hands-on                  
              experimental experience, and confidence sufficient to allow                    
              them to pursue scientific learning at a lay citizen's level.
