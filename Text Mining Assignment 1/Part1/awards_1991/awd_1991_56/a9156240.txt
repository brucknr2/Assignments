Abstract    :
              ComputingThis project encourages more students, especially                     
              minorities, women, and the physically disabled, to enter                       
              careers in computer science and engineering.  The target                       
              audience consists of students enrolled in introductory classes                 
              for non-science majors, future teachers, as well as                            
              introductory courses for computer science and engineering                      
              majors.  The project illustrates the major themes of computer                  
              science and engineering; fosters technological literacy; and                   
              provides hands-on familiarization, exploratory learning and                    
              experimentation with computer applications using an integrated                 
              academic program of interactive, instructional software and                    
              digital video delivery options.  Two modules, Computers and                    
              Television, and Computers and Music, are being designed,                       
              developed, prototyped, and evaluated.  Provisions are being                    
              incorporated into the products so that they may be ported to                   
              various software platforms.  The goal of the products is to                    
              allow students to not only master the most important principles                
              of computer science and engineering, but also discover that                    
              science is exciting, engaging, and interesting and open to                     
              minorities, women, and the physically disabled.
