Abstract    :
              This project will develop a second-year course for engineers                   
              that stresses "teaming" , written and oral communications,                     
              creative and crtitical thinking and responsible design                         
              strategies. The course is a sequel to a first-year design                      
              course that is presently in place. The project will permit                     
              formal training of the faculty in methods of instruction                       
              suitable for courses which will be based on the team concept.                  
              The faculty will participate in seminars conducted by Boeing                   
              Aircraft Company which are used for in-house training.                         
              Materials developed under the aegis of the project will be                     
              tested in current courses and complete materials will be                       
              created to permit the teaching of the course in its entirety in                
              Fall 1993. The project faculty will be assisted in the planning                
              and evaluation by distinguished outside consultants.
