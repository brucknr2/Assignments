Abstract    :
              In Computer Science (CS) education, the term "laboratory" often                
              means a room full of terminals where students go, on their own                 
              time, to work on their programming projects.  This project                     
              seeks to change this definition by developing and disseminating                
              materials for a series of scheduled, structured, and supervised                
              laboratory sessions.  The labs will complement, not replace,                   
              the traditional lecture-and-project paradigm in introductory                   
              survey courses in CS.  The labs will be implemented in a visual                
              programming environment that permits students to focus on                      
              concepts, rather than language syntax.  The software and                       
              related materials will be developed and tested during a one-                   
              year pilot program.  The program will yield data about the                     
              usefulness of laboratories in introductory survey courses in CS                
              and about the utility of visual programming environments for                   
              learning.
