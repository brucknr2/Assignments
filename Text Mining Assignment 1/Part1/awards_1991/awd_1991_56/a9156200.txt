Abstract    :
              To address the need to reform science education in the schools,                
              a new course is being developed for future elementary school                   
              teachers that will internationalize the curriculum and                         
              demonstrate the impact of science on society.  The objectives                  
              of the course are to 1) increase students' knowledge of                        
              environmental and social sciences, especially global issues, 2)                
              increase students' enthusiasm to teach about science by                        
              underscoring its relevance to society and social issues, and 3)                
              enhance the capacity of future elementary teachers to teach                    
              about the environment, global issues and their relationship.                   
              The course in global ecology will be required for all                          
              elementary education majors and will be a prerequisite for                     
              science and social studies methods courses.  It combines                       
              science and social science perspectives and is to be taught                    
              jointly by biology and political science faculty members.  A                   
              special feature of this course will be the development of field                
              experiences at St. Louis institutions with a special interest                  
              in ecological issues, such as the Missouri Botanical Garden,                   
              the St. Louis Zoo and the St. Louis Science Center.  Alternate                 
              exercises are being developed to help teachers adapt the                       
              curriculum to local facilities and conditions.  A                              
              curriculum/implementation guide is being developed that will be                
              presented at a national conference and a local in-service                      
              conference.
