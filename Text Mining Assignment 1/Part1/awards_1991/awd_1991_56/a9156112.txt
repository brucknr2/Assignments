Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to support the development,                   
              evaluation, and export of a new curriculum and supporting                      
              materials focused around the practice of computing, especially                 
              in the first two years.  The thrust of the new curriculum is                   
              based upon a core sequence of closed laboratories.  Lecture                    
              materials and content will be supportive of the laboratories                   
              rather than the other way around.  As a discipline, Computer                   
              Science has seen many dramatic changes in its brief history.                   
              Through new textbooks and an evolving curriculum, the content                  
              of undergraduate Computer Science education has for the most                   
              part kept pace with these changes.  But the pedagogy has hardly                
              changed.  It emphasizes individual skill in writing short                      
              programs in a dead language, from scratch.  This emphasis is                   
              the antithesis of that needed by a contemporary computing                      
              professional.  This project develops a practice-centered                       
              undergraduate Computer Science curriculum, and specifically                    
              develops a collection of laboratory materials that support this                
              approach.  Central to the approach is an increased degree of                   
              rigor in all courses, coupled with the early introduction and                  
              subsequent use of modern software development methods and                      
              tools.The expectation is that this pedagogical shift will have                 
              the highest leverage for improving Computer Science education.
