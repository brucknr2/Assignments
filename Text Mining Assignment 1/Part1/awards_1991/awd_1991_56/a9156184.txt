Abstract    :
              This project addresses the problem of science literacy of the                  
              non-scientist. It will modify the curriculum and laboratory                    
              experiences involving the introductory astronomy course which                  
              is generally taken by nonscience majors as a way of satisfying                 
              a general education science requirement. It involves                           
              development of educational activities using computer                           
              simulations and image processing with commercial software.                     
              These activities include laboratories on naked eye phenomena                   
              involving the Voyager night sky simulation, planetary modeling                 
              involving the SimEarth simulation, and image processing                        
              involving NASA spacecraft planetary images and CCD images                      
              obtained locally. The Indoor Telescope, which is an extensive                  
              simulation of an astronomical research telescope that has been                 
              developed and used for the last eight years will be modified                   
              for more modern computers. Finally, a curriculum will be                       
              developed which will involve highly motivated nonscience majors                
              in simple astronomical research using data obtained both with                  
              on-campus facilities and an Automatic Photoelectric Telescope                  
              located on Mt. Hopkins in southern Arizona. These innovations                  
              which will give nonscience students a greater opportunity to                   
              experience science as it is done have the potential of                         
              increasing the science literacy of these future leaders of                     
              society.
