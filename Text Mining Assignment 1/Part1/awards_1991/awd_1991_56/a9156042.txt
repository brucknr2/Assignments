Abstract    :
              A sophomore quantitative analysis course that includes  organic                
              analysis, mixture analysis, and physical/structural                            
              characterization, as well as current issues such as regulatory                 
              requirements, quality assurance, and information management is                 
              being developed.  A key ingredient to achieve this result is                   
              the organization of analytical concepts according to nuclear                   
              and electronic properties.  Such an approach is broad enough to                
              encompass all modes of modern chemical characterization and to                 
              incorporate the study of complex mixtures and sampling                         
              strategies, and chemical separations.
