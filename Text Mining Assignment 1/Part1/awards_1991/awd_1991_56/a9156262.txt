Abstract    :
              Currently, many implementations of multimedia into a community                 
              college involve using commercially produced laser disc                         
              technology.  The results from this type of implementation have                 
              been excellent (Miles, 1990).  But this community college                      
              environment requires addressing the specific cultural,                         
              vocabulary, and nontechnical background of the students. The                   
              campus is a Community College branch of the New Mexico State                   
              system and serves a population which is 65% women, 24% Native                  
              American, and 26% Hispanic. Satellite programs are held on                     
              nearby reservations where the population is 99% Native                         
              American. The Branch, therefore, will produce its own                          
              interactive video material (Griffith, 1988; McCool, 1984).                     
              Until the recent development of the PC-VCR, the cost for                       
              developing interactive video presentations in-house was                        
              prohibitive.  The general procedure for this institution is to                 
              integrate interactive video systems, in-house production                       
              facilities, and the creative talent of Branch faculty and                      
              students.  Implementation will affect four major areas: the                    
              Computer Literacy course, presentations to public and                          
              reservation schools, the Branch faculties class preparation                    
              work, and the Branch students' assignment preparation.
