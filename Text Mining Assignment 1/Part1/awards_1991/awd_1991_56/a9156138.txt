Abstract    :
              The project engages students in learning through the use of                    
              writing groups, in which small groups of students work together                
              throughout the course to: 1) develop their oral and written                    
              communication skills; 2) incorporate small-group experiences                   
              into large courses; and 3) expand the students' understanding                  
              of the nature and methods of geology. Innovative writing                       
              assignments and associated small group activities supplement                   
              lectures in Physical and Historical Geology courses. The                       
              writing assignments develop observational and critical-thinking                
              skills, introduce students to the practice of geology today,                   
              and foster awareness of the role of geology in society. As                     
              students meet to review each others' papers, they develop their                
              oral and written communication skills, learn to use technical                  
              language precisely, discuss interpretations, and evaluate                      
              arguments. Teaching assistants, trained undergraduate geology                  
              majors, monitor the group work, respond to and evaluate the                    
              short papers and participate in small-group activities.
