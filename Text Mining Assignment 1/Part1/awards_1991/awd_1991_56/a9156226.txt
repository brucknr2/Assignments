Abstract    :
              This project is for the development of a technological literacy                
              course, "The Digital World", to be stored on a CD ROM, for                     
              national distribution.  The course is designed to be completely                
              portable; any faculty member with a Macintosh and a CD drive                   
              will be able to offer it.  In an effort to reach students who                  
              would not normally consider technologically oriented courses,                  
              the course has no prerequisites and will require no advanced                   
              mathematics.                                                                   
              The course will use a hands-on, active approach to learning.                   
              For example, the final project will include student involvement                
              in a project such as designing simple tic-tac-toe-playing chips                
              that compete against each other in a tournament on the last day                
              of class. A prototype version of the course will be taught at                  
              Dartmouth College.  Feedback from students and faculty will be                 
              used to develop a second version, which will then be                           
              distributed on CD ROM.
