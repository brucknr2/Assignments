Abstract    :
              Preliminary research investigating the efficacy of the                         
              pedagogical innovations described in this proposal--ConcepTests                
              coupled with Peer Instruction-has shown very promising results.                
              The technique has two primary goals:                                           
                                                                                             
              1.       to expose students' common misconceptions about                       
                       fundamental principles via the use of ConcepTests, and                
                                                                                             
              2.       to rectify these notions, and promote understanding of                
                       basic concepts, through Peer Instruction. Greater                     
                       understanding, in turn, leads to a greater appreciation of            
                       the material, and is ultimately expected to result in an              
                       increased interest in the sciences.                                   
                                                                                             
              An initial application of this method in introductory physics                  
              classes indicated that the program achieved both of these                      
              objectives.  The initial research is being extended to quantify                
              the results, improve and fine tune the procedures, and                         
              systematize its application so it can be widely applied in                     
              undergraduate science, mathematics, and engineering education.                 
              A parallel application of the method is being conducted at                     
              Lowell University to examine the transferability of the                        
              methods.
