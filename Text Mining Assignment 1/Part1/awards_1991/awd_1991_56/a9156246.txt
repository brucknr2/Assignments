Abstract    :
              The investigators address three major national needs for non-                  
              majors courses oriented to physiology and anatomy: 1) well                     
              designed modules to serve classes based on investigative                       
              laboratories, 2) a means to decrease reliance on experimental                  
              use of vertebrates, and 3) a means to decrease the cost of                     
              laboratory equipment so all students can have some hands-on                    
              experience.  The proposal requests funds to design and                         
              implement a set of microcomputer-based laboratories (MBL) that                 
              will: 1) allow measurement of basic physiologic processes, 2)                  
              facilitate direct interface of the data with microcomputers,                   
              and 3) enable students to easily record, graph and present                     
              results. The MBL modules will cover 3 basic systems; sensory                   
              (how to measure skin temperature, response time and heat flux),                
              effector (how to measure reflex arcs, performance and rates of                 
              fatigue) and cardiopulmonary (measure heart and respiration                    
              rate).  The expected outcomes are: 1) an investigative                         
              laboratory based second semester non-majors biology course, and                
              2) a text describing how to build similar inexpensive equipment                
              so that the MBL can be implemented at other institutions.
