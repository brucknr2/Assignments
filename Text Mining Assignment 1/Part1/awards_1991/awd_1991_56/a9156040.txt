Abstract    :
                The goal of this project is to develop an instructional                      
              module for first-year college, and senior high school, students                
              that uses a stimulating video, subsequent role playing, and                    
              class projects.  The module uses advanced technology to deliver                
              the following messages:  (1) Careers in engineering are                        
              important, well respected, intellectually challenging,                         
              creative, and socially responsible.  (2) Engineering is not                    
              just a "man's" profession.  (3) It is important for everyone to                
              be technologically literate.  An Advisory Board is being formed                
              to review and revise the development of the material.  A script                
              is being developed for the video material, and a team of                       
              university and high school teachers and students is writing                    
              instructional materials.  Plans will be developed to produce                   
              the video material and to test the module in introductory                      
              engineering courses at two universities and in a special course                
              on the Principles of Engineering at selected high schools in                   
              New York State.
