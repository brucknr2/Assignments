Abstract    :
              This project institutes a three-year visiting professorship                    
              program in gender and the sciences--which includes the                         
              biological and physical sciences, mathematics, engineering, and                
              provides semester-long visiting professorships,  faculty-mentee                
              fellowships, monthly faculty development seminars for a                        
              semester in nine science departments, and the development or                   
              revision of 36 introductory science courses affecting close to                 
              4,000 undergraduate students during the initial funding period                 
              and thousands more within the next few years.  The purpose of                  
              this project is to address the increasing shortage in                          
              scientific professionals by reaching, in their early college                   
              years, the "second tier"--defined by Sheila Tobias as that                     
              group of students who, though qualified to do science,                         
              routinely choose another major. The University of Wisconsin                    
              System Women's Studies Consortium focuses on two aspects of                    
              this problem: 1) the underrepresentation of the second tier, in                
              general, and women and minorities, in particular, in scientific                
              and technical fields; and 2) the factors--specifically the                     
              content, pedagogy, and climate--in introductory science courses                
              which discourage the "second tier" from pursuing science                       
              majors.  This project design is founded on the assumption that                 
              incorporation of the new scholarship about gender in the                       
              scientific canon and curriculum will improve the quality of the                
              introductory courses which will, in turn, lead to the                          
              recruitment of more women, minorities, and others in the second                
              tier to scientific education and careers.
