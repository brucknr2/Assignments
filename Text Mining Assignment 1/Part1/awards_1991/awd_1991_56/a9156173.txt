Abstract    :
              "Venture" Courses in Chemistry on Themes of Energy and Life                    
              New first year chemistry courses with laboratory will be                       
              developed for potential chemistry majors.  The first two such                  
              courses will be titled "Energy and the Environment: Chemical                   
              Principles, Systems and Practices," and "Chemistry of Life:                    
              Chemical Principles, Systems, and Practices."  Both courses                    
              will be taught in the Venture format that has been developed at                
              Rochester.  In this format, each chemistry course will be                      
              centered on a general theme and will be coupled with a writing                 
              course and a course from another discipline.  Initial                          
              enrollments will be limited to 40 students.  If successful,                    
              enrollments will be expanded to 100 students.  The general                     
              themes were chosen to motivate beginning students.  The Venture                
              format has successfully improved the ability of students to see                
              course material in a larger context, to make connections                       
              between disciplines, to interact, and to think critically.                     
              This is the first time the concept will be tested with a                       
              quantitative science course that provides a foundation for                     
              majoring in chemistry.***//
