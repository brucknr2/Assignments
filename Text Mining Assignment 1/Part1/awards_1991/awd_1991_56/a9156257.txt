Abstract    :
              This project will develop a new course - along with class notes                
              and related computer exercises - designed to strengthen                        
              freshmen programs in engineering. The course called                            
              Introduction to Engineering Analysis will provide an integrated                
              treatment of vector mechanics, primarily statics, and linear                   
              algebra, with a concurrent emphasis on the use of computer-                    
              based methods for solving problems. Students will learn key                    
              principles of mechanics and linear algebra in one integrated                   
              course.  Students will be presented with a more coherent and                   
              realistic picture of the relevance of linear algebra and                       
              computational methods in the solution of engineering problems.                 
              The project will result in the development of all instructional                
              materials and a trial offering of the course, followed by                      
              evaluations and revisions, and ending with a finished course                   
              and associated notes and exercises, including computer                         
              exercises, which can be disseminated to other institutions                     
              interested in this new approach.
