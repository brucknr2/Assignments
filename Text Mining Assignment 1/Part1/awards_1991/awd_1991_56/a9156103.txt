Abstract    :
              This project develops and tests tutorial software which                        
              demonstrates basic topics of engineering mathematics necessary for             
              entry level engineering courses.  It also provides demonstrations              
              of typical engineering applications.  This tutorial software will              
              help students understand and use these mathematical concepts in                
              their engineering courses.  The software will be developed for                 
              terminals or workstations using X Windows and should be easily                 
              portable to many universities.  The software will be designed for              
              low overhead use with no knowledge of programming languages,                   
              operating systems, or database structures required of the user.                
              The first electrical circuits course will be used to evaluate the              
              effectiveness of the tutorial software and results of the                      
              evaluation will be used to improve the design and content of the               
              system.  The feasibility of using stored video recordings of real              
              experiments for use with computer generated visualizations will be             
              explored.  The structure of the tutorial software will be                      
              documented so that others can add modules to the system.                       
              Distribution of the software will be handled by the Office of                  
              Continuing Education at Santa Clara University and through Sun                 
              Microsystems' Catalyst Education Program.
