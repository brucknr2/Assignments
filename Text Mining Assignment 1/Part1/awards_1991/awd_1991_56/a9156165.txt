              for entry-level courses in colleges and universities.  The                     
              Science As A Way Of Knowing (SAAWOK) series is targeted to                     
              those who teach first-year biology courses in colleges and                     
              universities and is sponsored by the Education Committee of                    
              ASZ.  Goals of SAAWOK are to encourage teachers to: 1)                         
              emphasize the concepts of biology in entry-level courses, 2)                   
              relate how scientific procedures lead to a better understanding                
              of the natural world and to the solution of many important                     
              human problems, and 3) present biology as a relevant human                     
              discipline. The specific aims of this SAAWOK symposium are: 1)                 
              presenting a symposium on a timely topic, Biodiversity, 2)                     
              providing hands-on curricular materials on Biodiversity                        
              including symposium proceedings, overheads and slides, and                     
              essays to the participating teachers, and 3) disseminating                     
              these materials on a worldwide basis. Participants will include                
              ASZ registrants as well as college, university and high school                 
              teachers from the Northwest U.S. and Canada who will be invited                
              to register at a reduced fee.  Materials will be preprinted and                
              distributed at the symposium and the symposium proceedings will                
              be published in the American Zoologist.
