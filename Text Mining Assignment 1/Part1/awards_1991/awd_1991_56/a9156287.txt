Abstract    :
              To address the high attrition rate for women in introductory                   
              biology courses, the biology department at this women's college                
              is developing a theme-based, investigative introductory biology                
              curriculum, whose goals are: (1) to provide a classroom climate                
              that fosters collaboration and self-directed learning, (2) to                  
              teach science in a manner that emphasizes method over content                  
              and stresses connections to other disciplines and societal                     
              issues, and (3) to provide laboratory experiences that model                   
              for students the way in which scientific knowledge is acquired.                
              Two theme-based introductory courses are being developed for                   
              students interested in a biology major, the Biology of Women                   
              and Environmental Interactions.  The course format consists                    
              primarily of small group discussion and computer-based self-                   
              tutorial.  The laboratories consist of a series of mini-                       
              projects in which student research teams formulate hypotheses,                 
              design and execute experiments, and analyze and disseminate                    
              their results.  The proposed curriculum provides a model for                   
              educating women in science and encouraging them to pursue                      
              scientific careers.
