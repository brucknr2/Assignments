Abstract    :
              Coordinated Introductory Courses for Computer Science and                      
              Mathematics Majors                                                             
              This project restructures and coordinates a common core of                     
              introductory courses for computer science and mathematics                      
              majors.  The courses are Mathematical Foundations I and II and                 
              Algorithmic Computation I and II.  The mathematics courses                     
              introduce abstract mathematical concepts from discrete                         
              mathematics, logic, and graph theory, and the computer science                 
              courses apply these concepts to the development of algorithms                  
              that can be implemented on a computer.  The computer science                   
              courses rely on the functional and logical programming                         
              paradigms as a basis for direct application of mathematical                    
              concepts in algorithmic form.  By stressing visualization,                     
              concrete examples, and practical applications in the                           
              laboratory, these courses make abstract concepts accessible to                 
              under-prepared students; New Mexico State University is                        
              recognized by the Department of Education as a Minority                        
              Institution.  All four courses are required by computer science                
              majors, and the mathematics majors are required to take all but                
              the last computer science course, which is optional in their                   
              program.***//
