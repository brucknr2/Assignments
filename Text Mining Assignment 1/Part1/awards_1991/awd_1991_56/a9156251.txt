Abstract    :
              This project advances educational reform in undergraduate                      
              science by taking an interdisciplinary approach in which                       
              students create their own scientific community. The project                    
              plan emphasizes student participation in experimental science                  
              and represents an extension of the principles of discovery-                    
              oriented learning. The model of educational reform includes:                   
              instructor-generated discovery laboratories, student-generated                 
              laboratories, the creation by students of a Natural Science                    
              Database, a student-staffed Center for Science Discovery,                      
              independent research and off-campus explorations. The project                  
              philosophy complements that of the Ohio Mathematics/Science                    
              Discovery Project which deals with K-12 educatiion and which is                
              funded by the NSF under the Statewide Systemic Initiative                      
              program. The project also embodies a detailed plan for                         
              assessment and dissemination.
