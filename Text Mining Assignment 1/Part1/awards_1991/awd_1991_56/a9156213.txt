Abstract    :
              This project addresses the problem of scientific illiteracy by                 
              designing multidisciplinary science courses which cohesively                   
              integrate the study of the physical and life sciences and                      
              emphasize scientific inquiry-- observing, questioning, and                     
              making connections and inferences.  The overall goal is to                     
              produce citizens who are capable of reading about and                          
              understanding contemporary scientific issues.  Building on                     
              prior experience with FIPSE, NEH and projects to devise                        
              learning strategies and design multidisciplinary courses, the                  
              project (1) develops two multidisciplinary laboratory science                  
              courses for non-science students; (2) prepares materials so                    
              that these will be student-centered "active learning" courses;                 
              and (3) prepares faculty to teach these courses. As a result,                  
              after three years, the courses are to be mainstreamed into the                 
              Nassau Community College curriculum, 12 faculty are to be                      
              prepared to teach each course, and the courses and the                         
              materials prepared for them are to serve.
