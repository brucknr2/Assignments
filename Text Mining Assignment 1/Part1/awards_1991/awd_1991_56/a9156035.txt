Abstract    :
              Two pilot courses will be developed that introduce a viable                    
              research component for students in their first semester at                     
              college.  These laboratory-oriented courses will be constructed                
              to heighten interest in science by providing exciting and                      
              rewarding original research experiences in the fields of                       
              physical, analytical, and biological chemistry.  Carefully                     
              designed research experiences were chosen which (1) would be of                
              interest to the scientific community, (2) utilize concepts and                 
              techniques comprehensible to a college freshman, and (3) are                   
              achievable in a limited time. One of the courses, Science                      
              Methodology, will engage the students in identifying and                       
              measuring physical/chemical data for submission to the CRC                     
              Handbook of Chemistry and Physics. In the second course,                       
              Preserving Genomes, students will construct genomic libraries                  
              from a wide variety of organisms, including endangered species,                
              for possible inclusion in the American Type Culture Collection.
