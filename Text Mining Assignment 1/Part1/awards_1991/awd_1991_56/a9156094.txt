Abstract    :
              This proposal seeks funding for a week-long, faculty workshop,                 
              LABSHOP, for 36 participants, to develop laboratory exercises                  
              suitable for introductory, multiple-section biology courses                    
              that promote an active student involvement via a problem-                      
              solving or SAAW0K-type approach.  The problem-solving                          
              instructional approach, best employed in the laboratory                        
              classroom, can provide a more self-directed, investigative,                    
              learning environment that can help solve the science education                 
              problem.  LABSHOP will bring together an interdisciplinary                     
              group of participants to work in teams on selected topics.  The                
              final products of LABSHOP will be a variety of student-ready,                  
              laboratory exercises that employ a                                             
              problem/solving/investigative instructional approach.  To                      
              encourage a continuing dialogue among LABSH0P participants, to                 
              explore new approaches and teaching techniques, to encourage                   
              communication among biologists concerned with the quality of                   
              introductory laboratory instruction, to disseminate the LABSHOP                
              products, and to promote innovation among an even larger,                      
              interdisciplinary group of biologists, a free, computer                        
              bulletin board, BIOLAB, will be established by this project.
