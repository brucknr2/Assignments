Abstract    :
              A field oriented geological science curriculum initiative                      
              rooted in hands-on, discovery-based pedagogical methods has                    
              been designed to attract first-year undergraduate students to                  
              the sciences. The program includes a six-week pre-freshman                     
              geology/environmental science field course for under-prepared                  
              entering students that stresses field research, laboratory and                 
              analytical methods, and development of quantitative skills.                    
              This is followed by a fall semester freshman seminar, entitled                 
              Geology Outdoors.  The principal goals of the curriculum                       
              initiative are (1) to attract more minority students into the                  
              geosciences at an earlier stage, (2) to provide them with an                   
              innovative and exciting course of study in a welcoming and                     
              nurturing atmosphere, and (3) to encourage all students to                     
              consider careers in the geosciences as viable and attractive                   
              options for the future.
