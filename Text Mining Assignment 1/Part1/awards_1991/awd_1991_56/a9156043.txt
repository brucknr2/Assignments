Abstract    :
              To assist students to acquire the basic quantitative problem-                  
              solving skills they need to succeed in science, Howard                         
              Community College, MD, working collaboratively with Cumberland                 
              County College, NJ, and other community colleges, is creating                  
              an interactive multimedia program to teach scientific                          
              computational fundamentals. The program will diagnose and teach                
              at three levels (based on Gagne's cognitive skills hierarchy)                  
              of scientific computational skills--reviewing specific science-                
              related math skills, applying math to specific science-related                 
              tasks and performing scientific problem-solving.The program,                   
              draws upon all the graphic, sound, computer-branching, and                     
              video capabilities of multimedia instruction, will include a                   
              test instrument that will be used to assess students prior                     
              knowledge, devise an individualized learning plan, and evaluate                
              knowledge gained.  The instructional components will be                        
              "generic"--not specific to any one science discipline--but                     
              separate problem sets will be developed for biology, chemistry,                
              and physics thereby customizing the program to each                            
              discipline.The innovative curriculum, including adaptation of                  
              classroom instruction, will be evaluated at the project                        
              colleges, as well as several other two-year colleges serving as                
              independent peer review sites.
