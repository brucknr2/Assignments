Abstract    :
              A cooperative effort among six colleges - Dartmouth, Grinnell,                 
              King, Middlebury, Princeton, and Spelman - is resulting in the                 
              development and teaching of  new introductory mathematics                      
              course called CHANCE. CHANCE treats issues that are reported in                
              the news: statistical problems related to AIDS, the effects of                 
              lowering serum cholesterol on heart attacks, the use of DNA                    
              fingerprinting in the courts, maintaining quality of                           
              manufactured goods in the face of variation, informed patient                  
              decision making, reliability of political polls, and so forth.                 
              Students study the newspaper accounts of these topics, articles                
              in general science journals, such as Chance, Science, Nature,                  
              and Scientific American, and finally the original research                     
              papers. Summary modules, student projects, classroom                           
              experiences, data sets, bibliographies, and other materials are                
              being  disseminated to both college and precollege teachers                    
              through an electronic network.
