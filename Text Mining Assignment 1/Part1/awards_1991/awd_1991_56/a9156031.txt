Abstract    :
              The four senior investigators coordinate the work of a larger                  
              group, currently nineteen, representing at least a dozen                       
              colleges and universities.  During the first year of the                       
              project (1991-92), these nineteen met at a workshop at Colgate                 
              to present modules for teaching parallel computing concepts in                 
              various courses in the undergraduate computer science                          
              curriculum.  These modules are being revised and edited, and                   
              will be distributed for testing in courses in the winter and                   
              spring of 1992.  This award will continue this project from                    
              1992 to 1994.  Early in the summer of 1992, a second workshop                  
              to discuss teaching experiences and work on revising modules                   
              will be held.  The senior investigators will complete revision                 
              and editing of the modules based on the testing experiences.                   
              At the same time, plans for an appropriate channel for                         
              distribution will be formulated.  During 1992-93 and in the                    
              summer of 1993, the senior investigators will complete the                     
              extension of modules to cover different languages and hardware,                
              and fill in gaps of coverage revealed by teaching experiences.                 
              The project will be completed with the publication of the                      
              modules in 1994.
