Abstract    :
              New data-analytic and concepts-based textbooks along with                      
              advances in statistical software, and computer and multimedia                  
              technology now offer the opportunity to rethink the way in                     
              which we teach statistics. Our goal is to combine and augment                  
              these resources to develop a unified curriculum and supporting                 
              materials for teaching statistical concepts and methods. We                    
              will deliver:                                                                  
                                                                                             
                      laboratory manuals designed as a bridge between standard              
                       texts and computer software that will guide students                  
                       through experiments that generate data for analysis;                  
                      video stories that take the student "into the field" to               
                       see how data were collected and to help them understand               
                       the context of the data analysis                                      
                      start-up materials to aid students, especially                        
                       disadvantaged students, use computers for statistics;                 
                      a machine-readable encyclopedia of examples and problems              
                       that will include data, descriptions of experiments, and              
                       computer-based retrieval;                                             
                      a computer CD-ROM archive of edited "bites" from the video            
                       stories and existing video materials keyed to specific                
                       statistical concepts and tied to an instructional                     
                       statistics program; and                                               
                      an experimental test of the effect of early enrollment in             
                       statistics by minority students on their subsequent                   
                       academic performance and attitude towards science and                 
                       mathematics.                                                          
                                                                                             
              When this project is complete, it will represent the first time                
              that such a comprehensive package of multimedia materials will                 
              be used in introductory statistics courses and made available                  
              nationally.
