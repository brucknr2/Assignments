Abstract    :
              A Resource and Environmental Geology course using issues and                   
              problems of contemporary interest as the vehicle to introduce                  
              basic scientific principles.  Class activities involve the                     
              active engagement of students in "thought experiments" and                     
              hands-on exercises in lab and field through the emphasis on the                
              collection, consideration and use of scientific evidence and                   
              principles  in historical, political, economic, and cultural                   
              contexts.  The products of class assignments  require clear                    
              articulation of the problem and proposed solutions via both the                
              written and spoken word.  Collaborative learning is featured.                  
              The goals of this approach are to a) show the connections of                   
              Science to our social institutions, b) promote critical                        
              thinking and communication skills, and c) recruit and mentor                   
              science students, while making science education more                          
              accessible to all students.
