Abstract    :
              A curriculum based in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE)                
              is being developed which allows students to pursue "liberal                    
              engineering" options or to complete a more traditional ECE                     
              curriculum.  The primary liberal engineering option is a new                   
              major within the ECE department which involves only 40 credit                  
              hours similar to those of physics, math, or chemistry majors.                  
              The new major, "Electrical and Information Sciences," is                       
              offered in parallel with the more traditional programs in                      
              Electrical Engineering and Computer Engineering.  The heart of                 
              this program is a set of sophomore courses patterned on the                    
              "Just in Time" concept.  Prototype versions of these courses                   
              are being taught as a pilot program.  If successful, these                     
              courses will replace existing sophomore-level courses for all                  
              ECE undergraduates.
