Abstract    :
              There is a national need to produce capable molecular                          
              biologists as basic researchers, teachers and biotechnologists.                
              More undergraduates--especially minorities--must be suitably                   
              educated and encouraged to continue as biology majors and to                   
              enroll in advanced courses in molecular biology.  To help                      
              accomplish these goals, we propose a number of approaches                      
              designed to increase academic success and interest in freshman                 
              molecular biology; to encourage student entry into the teaching                
              profession; and to enhance the effectiveness of teaching                       
              assistants at SUNY-Binghamton as well as teachers from                         
              secondary schools and other colleges.  To address these needs,                 
              the freshman Cell and Molecular Biology courses is being                       
              reorganized and restructured to use historical and empirical                   
              approaches, to introduce cooperative learning and computer-                    
              constructed concept mapping, and to have laboratory classes                    
              that include more independent, student directed experiments.                   
              A training workshop and training manual focused on                             
              constructivist learning theory and practice is being developed                 
              for teaching assistants.  The effectiveness of the entire                      
              effort is being assessed with the help of an independent                       
              evaluator.
