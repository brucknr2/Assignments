Abstract    :
              This project will develop and extend computer-based education                  
              that enables students to visualize abstract aspects of general                 
              chemistry.  The software addresses a real learning problem,                    
              that of making the transition from two to three-dimensional                    
              representations of objects and models.  Existing physical                      
              models of adequate sophistication are helpful, but they take                   
              laboratory time and space, and do not allow views of interior                  
              details, nor transitions between views.  In problem solving,                   
              therefore, we focus on mathematical/physical intuition instead                 
              of the application of particular algorithms.  We help the                      
              students to make connections between physical reality and                      
              mathematical expressions.  The computer can show both the                      
              exterior of a model and make a seamless transition between                     
              exterior and interior views, including various intermediate                    
              states.  To assure the effectiveness of such simulations, we                   
              use sophisticated graphics, sound, and responsive quasi-tactile                
              interaction to engage the students fully in the learning                       
              experience.  We will first complete a module on bonding, to be                 
              followed by modules on gas laws, crystal structures, and                       
              solids.
