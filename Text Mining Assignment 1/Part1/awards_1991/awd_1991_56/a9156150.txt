Abstract    :
              This project is developing a curriculum and laboratory manual                  
              for a CCD-based imaging astronomy laboratory for first and                     
              second year undergraduate science majors. Students are learning                
              how to plan observations, acquire and correct CCD images, and                  
              perform sophisticated image analysis. The goal of the                          
              laboratory is to allow students to share in the excitement and                 
              challenge of scientific discovery using modern instruments and                 
              procedures, and to avoid the tedium and observational                          
              limitations of traditional techniques. The use of modern low-                  
              cost instruments allows students to concentrate on the                         
              astronomical significance of the observations rather than                      
              mastery of detailed telescope operations and photographic                      
              techniques. Although most of the equipment for the laboratory                  
              was already available, the project provided modest funds for                   
              computer equipment to allow enhanced image analysis and a CD-                  
              ROM system for laboratories using the HST guide star catalog                   
              and Voyager planetary images. The laboratory manual is being                   
              written to accommodate for a variety of CCD/telescope systems                  
              and will be made available for wide distribution when                          
              completed.
