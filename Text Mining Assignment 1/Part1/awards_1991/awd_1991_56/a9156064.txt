Abstract    :
              A text and related lecture materials for a lower division                      
              course in Fourier analysis for students in the mathematical,                   
              physical, and engineering sciences are being prepared and class                
              tested at SIUC and a number of other colleges and universities.                
              This course has become feasible due to the recent development                  
              of FOURIER, a software package that enables students to do                     
              calculations with a stack of `functions' in much the same way                  
              that they would do calculations with a stack of numbers on an                  
              RPN calculator.  Students will use FOURIER to explore classic                  
              and contemporary phenomena commonly analyzed with Fourier                      
              series, Fourier transforms, or the discrete Fourier transform                  
              and thereby come to appreciate the essential roles of                          
              mathematical analysis and computer simulation in modern science                
              and engineering.
