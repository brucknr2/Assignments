Abstract    :
              To bridge the gap between the background and level of college                  
              undergraduates taking introductory level sociology courses and                 
              the rapid advancement of empirically-based sociology, we will                  
              develop a series of curricular materials, including                            
              demonstrations and laboratory exercises for introductory level                 
              undergraduate level courses. We will design a computer based,                  
              data analysis, report generation, and graphical presentation                   
              engine, that will serve as the base for our initiative.  We                    
              will use it to develop a series of interactive curriculum                      
              modules which will convey the findings of recent empirical                     
              social research, through demonstrations, guided exercises and                  
              other experiences.   We will rigorously evaluate the materials,                
              in terms of their ease of adoption by faculty, their                           
              stimulation of interest by students, and their effectiveness in                
              conveying the findings of empirical research to introductory                   
              level students.
