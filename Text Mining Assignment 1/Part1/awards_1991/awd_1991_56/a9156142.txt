Abstract    :
              Sciences CurriculumThis project's strategy is to develop                       
              curricula and a non-traditional approach to teaching and                       
              learning of science/math for students who are: science and math                
              majors, education majors, and general education students. The                  
              goals are to increase retention of majors, prepare capable                     
              teachers and increase the scientific and technical literacy of                 
              citizens. Courses will be offered in a highly visual, user-                    
              friendly, computer-based learning environment CSLA's NeXT                      
              computer lab of 25 color workstations. Language barriers for                   
              the highly diverse , multi-ethnic population of CSLA are less                  
              of a problem in an interactive environment utilizing side-by-                  
              side pictures, animations, videos, sounds, graphs, words and                   
              numbers. Also, techniques, concepts and demonstrations which                   
              are too expensive, dangerous or which do not lend themselves to                
              traditional modes of instruction are taught. Faculty from                      
              Biology, Chemistry, Geology and Physics will modify                            
              introductory courses including Science Orientation, Intro                      
              Biology, Intro Chemistry, Quantitative Analysis, Environmental                 
              Geology, General Physics, and Astronomy. These curricular                      
              changes will involve 100 math, science and engineering                         
              undergraduate majors, 100 education majors, and 150 general                    
              education students annually. This project also seeks to inspire                
              and instruct other faculty about the intuitive, appealing and                  
              quickly mastered electronic desktop techniques. Evaluation will                
              be by external review and through comparison of student                        
              performance using traditional versus electronic desktop                        
              techniques. Results will be disseminated through publication,                  
              professional presentations, and regional workshops.
