Abstract    :
              Two existing core-curriculum, non-science-majors-oriented                      
              classes (approximate total enrollment 400/year; 2 natural                      
              science, 1 social science) will be modified in the following                   
              ways:  small discussion sections focused on "ill-structured                    
              problems" will be incorporated into existing laboratory                        
              periods, lecture styles will be modified to encourage more                     
              student involvement during class, and existing wet laboratories                
              will be modified to include more computer assisted exercises.                  
              These changes are modeled after Perry's theories of "cognitive                 
              development."  Faculty and student teaching assistants assigned                
              to the course will receive prior training (a workshop led by                   
              Dr. Craig E. Nelson of Indiana University, a recognized                        
              authority in the field) in the methods to be used.  Assessment                 
              of student pre and post course critical thinking skills and                    
              attitudes towards education and towards science and scientists                 
              will be by interviews of students and a paper and pencil test                  
              to be selected.  An educational consultant interested in                       
              developing critical thinking skills will conduct the testing                   
              phase of the proposal and will advise concerning appropriate                   
              forums for dissemination.
