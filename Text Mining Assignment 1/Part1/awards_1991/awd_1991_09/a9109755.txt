Abstract    :
              First order theories (and hence databases, knowledge bases, and                
              logic programs) could be inconsistence in many ways.  For                      
              example, during the construction of an expert system, we may                   
              consult many different experts.  Each expert may provide us with               
              a group of rules and facts which are self-consistent.  However,                
              when we coalesce the facts and rules provided by these different               
              experts, inconsistencies may arise.  Thus, a framework for                     
              reasoning about databases that contain inconsistent information                
              is necessary.  This work will study at least three alternative                 
              theoretical frameworks for carrying out such forms of reasoning                
              Such a study includes rigorously characterizing the meaning of                 
              inconsistent theories from a non-classical model-theoretic stad-               
              point.  Fixed-point characterizations of the different logical                 
              consequence relations, together with procedures for computing                  
              answers to such queries also come under the scope of the study.                
              A prototype implementation which serves as an experimental test-               
              bed for evaluating computational aspects of these alternative                  
              semantical frameworks will be developed.
