Abstract    :
              The objective of this research is to devise formal methodologies for           
              the design and analysis of self-stabilizing, distributed systems.  The         
              ability to react to unforeseen external perturbations is a fundamental         
              stability criterion of any intelligent distributed system.  Transient          
              failures affect the global state of a system in an unpredictable               
              manner.  A distributed system is called self-stabilizing when,                 
              regardless of its initial state, the system is guaranteed to recover           
              to a legitimate configuration in a finite number of steps.  In the             
              context of fault-tolerance, the concept of self-stabilization is of            
              fundamental importance.  However, many of the currently known self-            
              stabilizing systems are hand-crafted.  Much work needs to be done in           
              consolidating the design of self-stabilization algorithms and devising         
              formal methodologies, before these principles can be applied to the            
              design of non-trivial systems.  The proposed research will explore             
              methods for the design of non-trivial, self-stabilizing systems on             
              different interconnection topologies and investigate potential                 
              applications in the design of fault-tolerant distributed systems.
