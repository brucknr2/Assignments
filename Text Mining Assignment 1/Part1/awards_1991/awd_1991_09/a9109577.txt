Abstract    :
              Affinity membranes are a promising new bioseparation                           
              technology to overcome the limitations of conventional                         
              gel-bead columns, where performance is limited by                              
              intra-particle diffusion and pressure drop effects.  This                      
              project aims to: i) theoretically and experimentally                           
              determine the role of association kinetics and axial                           
              diffusion in the design and performance of affinity                            
              membranes; ii) recommend new, more optimal designs for                         
              affinity membranes; and iii) explore a new class of                            
              affinity bioseparations based on differences in                                
              association kinetics.
