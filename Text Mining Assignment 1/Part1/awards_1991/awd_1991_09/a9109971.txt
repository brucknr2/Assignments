Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The triennial meeting of the International Political Science                   
              Association is the principal venue for scientists from different               
              nations with common interests in political institutions, processes,            
              and behavior to meet and exchange research ideas.  The                         
              participation of American scientists in these meetings is vital not            
              only to insure that American political science benefits from the               
              latest developments in the discipline world wide but also because              
              American political science has much to offer the world community               
              in exchange.                                                                   
                                                                                             
              This modest grant will help to defray the expenses of 50 American              
              political scientists to participant in the XV World Congress of the            
              International Political Science Association in Buenos Aires, July,             
              1991.  In selecting scientists to participate in the conference,               
              emphasis will be placed on insuring balanced representation of both            
              younger and minority scholars as well as scholars from diverse sub-            
              fields.
