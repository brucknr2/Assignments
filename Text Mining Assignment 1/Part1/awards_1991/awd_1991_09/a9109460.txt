Abstract    :
              The alveoli (air cells) in the lungs are coated with a lining of               
              pulmonary surfactant which is a complex of lipids, proteins and                
              glycolipids.  This surfactant is essential to normal pulmonary                 
              behavior and its disruptions are implicated in abnormal lung                   
              functioning.  Dr. Amador will use a new technique, fluorescence                
              microscopy of model pulmonary surfactants spread upon the surface              
              of water to correlate the physiological effects of various native              
              and replacement surfactant systems with their microscopic phase                
              behavior and the dependence of this behavior upon biochemical                  
              composition.  The goal of this project is to enhance our                       
              understanding of the phase behavior and aggregational properties               
              of surfactant systems.
