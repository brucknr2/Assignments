Abstract    :
                 Mathematical morphology has been becoming an increasingly                   
              important and often-used technique in image processing and                     
              machine vision applications during recent decades.  Nevertheless,              
              the iterations of morphological operations exist a bottleneck in               
              implementation on a pipelined parallel architecture.  The                      
              objectives of this project are to propose a set of new                         
              morphological operators, called back-propagation morphology,                   
              which is different from the traditionally defined morphology for               
              solving time-consuming iteration problems, and to develop its                  
              underlying theorems, algorithms and architectures for various                  
              vision applications.                                                           
                 First-stage experiments show that the back-propagation                      
              morphology has the advantages of deriving a root of a signal                   
              which only requires two scans without numerous iterations and                  
              being suited for parallel architectures.  It is anticipated that               
              the proposed research program will lead to fundamental advances                
              in the theoretical understanding of the new back-propagation                   
              morphological operations.  The algorithms and architectures                    
              developed and the research findings produced by the project will               
              also have substantial utility for industry in advancing machine                
              vision inspection and recognition technologies.
