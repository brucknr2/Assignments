Abstract    :
                   This grant provides support for a research program by a                   
              faculty member of Ball State University to examine the effects                 
              of superdeformation on neutron multiplicity in heavy ion                       
              nuclear reactions.  The research will involve the                              
              participation of undergraduates (RUI) and will use facilities                  
              at Rochester University and other accelerator laboratories.
