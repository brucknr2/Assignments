Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              There are usually several sources of sound that we hear, all                   
              at the same time, yet the auditory system is quite good at                     
              segregating which sound components come from which source.  A                  
              sound source which is localized and identified based on its                    
              acoustic properties has been called an "auditory image" and may                
              depend on several features such as the frequency, intensity, and               
              pattern of its acoustic spectrum.                                              
                                                                                             
              This project investigates the role that coherent amplitude                     
              modulation (AM) may play in the formation and segregation of                   
              auditory images.  Processing of AM is evaluated with                           
              psychophysical detection, discrimination, and masking procedures,              
              to examine both how information on the modulation is extracted,                
              and how this information is combined across frequency regions to               
              aid auditory image formation.  Specific models will be tested                  
              along with computer simulations of subject performance.  The                   
              experiments use novel approaches to important questions of                     
              complex auditory functions, and results from this basic work also              
              are likely to have some impact on automated speech recognition                 
              systems and aids for the hearing impaired.
