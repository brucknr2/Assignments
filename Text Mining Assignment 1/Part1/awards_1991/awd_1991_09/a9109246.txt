Abstract    :
              This is a cross-disciplinary pilot study to                                    
              "reserve engineer" a portion of the                                            
              cardiovascular control system.  The central                                    
              nervous system component of the baroreceptor                                   
              reflex, a control mechanism that attempts to                                   
              keep arterial pressure approximately                                           
              constant, will be studied using intracellular                                  
              recordings.  Emphasis will be on the portion                                   
              of the reflex that alters vagal control of                                     
              heart rate in response to changes in arterial                                  
              pressure.  A computer model of the system                                      
              will be used to develop principles for the                                     
              control of chemical processes.  The                                            
              expectation is that understanding natural                                      
              control mechanisms will aid the development                                    
              of improved algorithms for controlling                                         
              engineering systems.
