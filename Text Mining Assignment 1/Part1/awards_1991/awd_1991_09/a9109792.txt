Abstract    :
                   This project in computer networking concerns controlling the              
              use of processing resources in large communication systems.  With              
              user demands growing in number and complexity, there is a need to              
              develop mechanisms for efficient resource allocation.  The focus               
              is on systems in which the underlying driving parameters vary with             
              time.  The approach addresses two shortcomings in several current              
              approaches to the optimization of resource control:  the                       
              assumptions that certain parameters are governed by known                      
              probability distributions, and that the driving parameters are                 
              stationary or constant with time.  This approach uses stochastic               
              optimization algorithms that execute on-line in a system in which              
              the driving parameters vary with time.  Convergence properties of              
              the algorithms using the relatively new theory of large deviations             
              are studied, and experiments conducted through simulation allow                
              comparison of different algorithms.  It is expected that the                   
              results will contribute to resource control in communication                   
              systems as well as to an increased understanding of time-varying               
              stochastic systems in general.
