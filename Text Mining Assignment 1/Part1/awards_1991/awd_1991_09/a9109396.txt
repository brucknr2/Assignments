Abstract    :
              Dr. Stout will study the interaction of metal ions with natural                
              polyelectrolytes.  With the ultimate aim of characterizing                     
              metal ion-humic acid binding, she will initially examine some                  
              systems that are less complex.  A carboxylate-substituted                      
              polysaccharide, alginic acid, will serve as the first model                    
              polyectrolyte since, it shares many of the properties of humic                 
              acid, but is structurally well-defined.  The mode and extent of                
              Eu3+ metal ion binding to alginic acid will be investigated                    
              using lanthanide luminescence spectroscopy.  As a result of                    
              these studies, Dr. Stout will have a better understanding of                   
              the potential of lanthanide luminescence spectroscopy for use                  
              in subsequent work with humic acids as well as the limitations                 
              of the technique.

              independent Federal research support to develop a competitive                  
              research project.  This project involves the use of ionic                      
              probes that luminesce to gain knowledge about the identity and                 
              nature of the binding site for metals thus revealing                           
              substantial information about the nature of polyelectrolytes                   
              such as humic acid.  This project may have important                           
              consequences in environmental chemistry.
