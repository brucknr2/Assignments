Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will study minimal hypersurfaces               
              in Riemannian manifolds. He will continue to develop and apply                 
              techniques from geometric measure theory and the geometric                     
              calculus of variations to existence problems for minimal                       
              surfaces. In addition the principal investigator will continue to              
              develop numerical methods for constructing minimizers.                         
                   The research supported by this award will attempt to                      
              describe how minimal surfaces lie in curved space. Minimal                     
              surfaces are surfaces which have minimal area for any prescribed               
              boundary curve drawn on the surface. These surfaces frequently                 
              occur in nature because many processes develop according to some               
              minimum energy principle. An important example is the solid-                   
              liquid boundary in a solidification process. Because there are so              
              many important examples of geometric minimization in the physical              
              sciences, a thorough understanding of the theoretical aspects of               
              the process can be expected to have a broad impact on science.
