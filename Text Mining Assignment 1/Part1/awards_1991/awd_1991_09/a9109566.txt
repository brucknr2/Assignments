Abstract    :
              This study examines the impact of computers on job stress and                  
              quality of working life.  The main characteristic of the                       
              conceptual model in this study is that stress effects are                      
              determined by a combination of technology and job                              
              characteristics.  The way work is organized and jobs are                       
              structured plays an important role in the relation between                     
              computer technology and job stress.  The research model is tested              
              with a population of office work (clerical workers and                         
              professionals) using various computer technology from one public               
              service organization.  The research uses multiple data collection              
              methods (questionnaire, interviews and log-in's), multiple                     
              sources of information (employees, supervisors, information                    
              systems personnel), and multiple times of data-collection (2                   
              times separated by one year).  The longitudinal design will allow              
              testing of the time-lagged and cumulative effects of computer                  
              technology on job stress, and the study of "natural" changes in                
              computer technology characteristics.  A four-week diary is                     
              conducted to measure computer technology characteristics and mood              
              states and to examine the relationships between these variables,               
              and job design and other measures of job stress.  This focused                 
              study of the use of computers by office workers in one                         
              organization can increase our theoretical knowledge about the                  
              impact of computer use on job stress and quality of working life.
