Abstract    :
                   The objective of this project is to study the problem of                  
              coordinating the production of a seat of assemblies and of the                 
              components required to produce them when the component production              
              yields and the demand for the assemblies are random.  This problem             
              is one of inter-plant coordination since the components and the                
              assemblies are usually produced in different plants.  The project              
              is motivated by a problem in semiconductor manufacturing where a               
              set of chips (components) is used to produce different thermo-                 
              conductor modules (assemblies).  The problem is formulated as a                
              stochastic program.  The research effort is divided between                    
              approximation schemes that exploit special structures of                       
              decomposition procedure that solves the problems in two stages.                
              An important tool is a new lower bound on the expectation of the               
              minimum of a set of random variables.                                          
                   Proper plant coordination should result in higher expected                
              (utility of) profit and in an increased ability to satisfy demand              
              for the assemblies.  Moreover, it should reduce the burden for the             
              plants producing components by releasing components for production             
              in the right mix.
