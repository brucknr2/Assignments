Abstract    :
              The conductance through a quantum point was                                    
              discovered in 1988 to be a multiple of the quantum                             
              conductance 2e2/h.  This quantum behavior may have                             
              an important impact on the development of future                               
              generation of electronic devices.  The focus of this                           
              project is to study the interaction between far-                               
              infrared photons and electrons in quantum point                                
              contacts.  It is expected that this conductance can be                         
              modulated by a small-amplitude far-infrared                                    
              radiation.  By absorbing photons, the electrons can                            
              raise their energies to above the level of a subband in                        
              the quantum point contact and contribute to                                    
              conduction.  This effect is similar to photon-assisted                         
              tunneling in superconducting tunnel junctions.  The                            
              result of this research may substantially improve our                          
              understanding of the quantum transport phenomena,                              
              and the interaction between electrons and photons in                           
              the quantum transport processes.  If the effect is                             
              verified experimentally, novel long-wavelength                                 
              optoelectronic devices, such as optically controlled                           
              switches and modulators, photon detectors and                                  
              heterodyne mixers, can be constructed.
