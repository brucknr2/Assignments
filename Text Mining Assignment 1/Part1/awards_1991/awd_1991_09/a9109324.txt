Abstract    :
                   In this project the principal investigator will explore the               
              use of new techniques to study what are called "abnormal" cases in             
              optimization and optimal control problems that involve nonregular              
              operators.  These techniques come from functional analysis, and                
              they have been applied successfully to treat abnormal cases                    
              involving the Euler-Lagrange equations and the Pontryagin Maximum              
              Principle.  The principal investigator is concerned specifically               
              with determining the limits of these techniques and with obtaining             
              sharper results than those obtained previously for the derivation              
              of nontrivial optimality conditions for general extremal problems.             
                   The derivation and exploitation of optimality conditions for              
              problems in optimization and optimal control have been one of the              
              major success stories of the decades since World War II.  These                
              results have paved the way for the development of a host of control            
              systems that have improved the quality of life. More recent                    
              advances involving robotic systems can be traced to this work as               
              well.  In this project the principal investigator will examine                 
              optimality conditions in atypical cases where the traditional                  
              theory is inadequate.  To do so requires the use of powerful                   
              methods of abstract functional analysis combined with a thorough               
              knowledge of classical control theory.
