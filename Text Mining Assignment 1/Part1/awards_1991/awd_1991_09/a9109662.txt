Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Serotonin is a brain transmitter substance that functions in a                 
              variety of different behaviors, two of which are sleep and                     
              movement. Measurement of serotonin in specific brain regions                   
              during behavior is made possible by a new technique called                     
              microdialysis. Dr. Auerbach will utilize this technique to study               
              the relationship between serotonin levels and the onset of sleep.              
              If serotonin release causes sleep, increases in this transmitter               
              should be seen at the time of sleep onset. The relationship                    
              between serotonin levels and rhythmic movements of the jaw and                 
              tongue will be studied to test the hypothesis that serotonin                   
              activates the neural structures which control these movements.                 
              This work will contribute to knowledge about the role of brain                 
              transmitters in regulation of behavioral events.
