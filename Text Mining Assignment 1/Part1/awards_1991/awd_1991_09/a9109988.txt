Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This action is part of a coordinated project to document and                   
              maintain special-purpose computer codes which can be used                      
              to study different aspects of the runup of a tsunami (seismic                  
              sea wave) onto a coastline.  It involves a collaboration                       
              between Professor Philip Liu at Cornell University, and                        
              Professors Kobayashi and Grilli at the University of                           
              Delaware.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              Quite a large number of special-purpose computer programs                      
              have been developed as part of student doctoral theses.                        
              Some of these codes were later found to have wider                             
              applicability, and are of interest to other researchers.  At the               
              time that they were developed, the substantial investment in                   
              effort and time needed to document them for general usage                      
              was not made.  There is now a growing recognition of this                      
              need, but there are no agreed-upon standards for such                          
              documentation.  This project is intended as a pilot study for                  
              documenting and maintaining three existing computer                            
              programs.  The objective is to develop guidelines for                          
              documentation and maintenance of such large computer                           
              codes, thereby defining a standard which other code                            
              developers can follow.                                                         
                                                                                             
              This action is for the work by Professor Liu at Cornell.  It                   
              involves a boundary element program which can be used to                       
              calculate the generation, propagation and runup of long                        
              waves onto a beach.
