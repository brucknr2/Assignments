Abstract    :
              This proposal examines the gap between what how well weather                   
              forecasters are expected to use additional information and how                 
              well they actually use it.  The proposal specifically examines how             
              that gap widens as a function of the amount and complexity of new              
              information.  The first study examines the effects on judgemental              
              reliability and validity of automating information acquisition and             
              information processing.  The second study examines the validity and            
              reliability of informatyion acquisition as a function of amount of             
              information.  The third study focusses on the reliability and                  
              validity of information processing.  The fourth study investigates             
              the interaction between information acquisition and information                
              processing as a function of amount of information.  The results of             
              this research will contribute to our understanding of expert                   
              judgement in weather forecasting and other fields.  It should have             
              practical implications for helping experts make the best use of                
              technology that increases the amount of information available to               
              them.
