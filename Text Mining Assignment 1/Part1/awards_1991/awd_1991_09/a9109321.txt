Abstract    :
              This conference will highlight scientific as well as                           
              engineering aspects of enzyme technology.  The program                         
              will include sessions devoted to improved biocatalysts                         
              through genetic engineering, new biomolecules with enzyme-                     
              like properties (for example, catalytic antibodies),                           
              applications of enzymes in synthesis, and biocatalyst and                      
              bioreactor design.
