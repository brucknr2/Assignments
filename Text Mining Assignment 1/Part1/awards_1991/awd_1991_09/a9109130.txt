Abstract    :
                   This project is concerned with research in matrix theory.  The            
              principal investigator will investigate spectral problems and                  
              matrix completion problems.  She will also study matrix completion             
              problems and k-cyclic matrices.                                                
                   A matrix is a rectangular array of objects.  Given two                    
              matrices there is a notion of how to add them and how to multiply              
              them.  This rather general setting turns out to be useful in                   
              describing situations which arise in many areas of science.
