Abstract    :
              This research is on complete fault coverage (at low cost) for                  
              synchronous sequential circuits.  A test generation strategy, which            
              alleviates the limitations of existing test generation procedures              
              is being investigated.  The essence of the approach is in the                  
              multiple time observation assumption, which removes the requirement            
              that a fault be detected by observation of the circuit's response              
              at a single time unit.  A fault model comprised of single and                  
              multiple transition faults, which covers many gate level stuck at              
              faults, is being explored.  Test generation procedures are aimed               
              at medium sized and large circuits, described as interconnections              
              of submachines.  Algorithms for decomposition of such circuits are             
              being investigated.  A comprehensive set of tools is being designed            
              especially for the purpose of achieving complete fault coverage.               
              The tools include: test generation, simulation, extraction and                 
              decomposition procedures.
