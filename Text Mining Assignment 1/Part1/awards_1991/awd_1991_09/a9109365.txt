Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The proposed research focuses on a better understanding of                
              the complex processes that takes place in a glow discharge.                    
              Primarily this involves studying the physical characteristics of               
              the discharge.  Although experimentally the processes have been                
              adapted for device manufacturing, the physics and the chemistry                
              of the processes have been relatively difficult to understand.                 
              This can be attributed to many reasons; Extreme complexities and               
              subtleties in the processes, the effect of spatial and temporal                
              variations of the electric fields, lack of fundamental data as to              
              the nature of electron and ion behavior, and so on.  With the                  
              advent of large and powerful supercomputers, a more precise                    
              numerical analysis of the complex system of equations governing                
              these processes has become feasible.  The problems to be studied               
              can be viewed as governed by a three-dimensional, time dependent,              
              system of equations, a formidable problem.  The application of                 
              the numerical techniques to this class of problems is possible,                
              provided a combination of highly advanced numerical schemes can                
              be achieved.  Such a systematic study of the discharges will help              
              in developing more efficient processes for semiconductor                       
              fabrication.
