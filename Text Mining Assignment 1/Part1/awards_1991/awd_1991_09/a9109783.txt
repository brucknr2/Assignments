Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The major objective of this research is to understand the                      
              molecular, cellular and systems-level mechanisms responsible for               
              the detection and discrimination of odorant mixtures and their                 
              components.  This includes gaining an understanding of the                     
              effects of mixtures interactions on coding in the nervous system               
              as well as the behavioral discrimination of odors and intensity.               
                                                                                             
              Experiments are conducted using the spiny lobster and a set of 7               
              odorant to examine the effects of mixture interactions on nerve                
              cell activity and behavioral responses using conditioning                      
              techniques to examine discrimination of odorant.  These studies                
              will contribute to a better understanding of the events that                   
              underlie the perception of odorant and how a relatively simple                 
              nervous system encodes this sensory information and uses it to                 
              control behavior to chemical substances.
