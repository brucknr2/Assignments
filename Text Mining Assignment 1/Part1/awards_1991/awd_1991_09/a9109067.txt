Abstract    :
                   Research Planning Grants are one-time awards designed to help             
              increase the number of new women investigators participating in NSF            
              research programs, and to facilitate preliminary studies and other             
              activities related to the development of competitive NSF research              
              proposals.                                                                     
                   The project will investigate the extension of reliable                    
              broadcast concepts to partitionable data communication networks.               
              Protocols that can tolerate network partitioning are becoming                  
              increasingly important as more applications are being run across               
              wide-area networks in which failures may cause partitioning.  Even             
              with local area networks, the use of taps and bridges may introduce            
              points of possible failure which can lead to partitioning.  The                
              objective of this project is to determine if the reliable broadcast            
              approach which has proven to be efficient and useful for non-                  
              partitionable local area networks can be adapted to handle                     
              partitioning with a reasonable amount of additional processing and             
              communication overhead.
