Abstract    :
                   Accurate measurements of total photoionization cross                      
              sections, of photoelectron angular distributions and of the                    
              positions and widths of autoionizing resonances near thresholds                
              will be made for excited states of neutral atoms.  Continuously                
              tuned pulsed dye lasers will be used to both excite and ionize                 
              free atoms in an atomic beam.  Absolute photoionization cross                  
              sections will be measured using a fluorescence-reduction                       
              technique.  An angular-selective electron detector/time-of-flight              
              energy analyzer will be used to measure the angular distributions              
              of ejected electrons.
