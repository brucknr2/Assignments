Abstract    :
              The objectives of the proposed research are 1) to develop a                    
              continuum theory of damage with field equations and boundary                   
              conditions based on the gauge principle; ii) to fully implement the            
              theory using symbolic computations and direct interface with a                 
              finite element code; iii) to investigate the interrelation between             
              global instability and local compressive failure based on                      
              bifurcation analysis of the continuum damage theory with connection            
              to fiber microbuckling; iv) conduct compression tests on composite             
              cylinders under combined loading in order to identify the failure              
              micromechanisms and correlate with theoretical predictions.  The               
              proposed research will have an impact on the optimum design of                 
              composite structures loading under combined loading and prone to               
              compressive failure.  It will also improve the modeling of                     
              manufacturing processes for high performance composites by                     
              identifying the micromechanisms of failure.
