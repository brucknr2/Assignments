Abstract    :
                   A promising model to study the neural mechanisms of motor                 
              plasticity is conditioned response learning which is a simple                  
              form of associative learning.  The eye-blink reflex has been                   
              widely adopted for physiologic studies of the mechanisms of                    
              conditioned response learning.  Recently, a significant                        
              advancement in the study of the conditioned eye-blink has been                 
              made.  Using the in vitro brainstem-cerebellum preparation from                
              the turtle, the neural correlates of the conditioned eye-blink                 
              response can be generated entirely in vitro.  Thus the cellular                
              mechanisms underlying this type of motor learning will be more                 
              accessible for study than has previously been achieved using                   
              whole animal preparations.  As an initial step in studying the                 
              mechanisms of acquisition and execution of learned motor                       
              responses in vitro, the goals of Dr. Joyce Keifer are: 1) to                   
              examine sites of convergence of conditioned and unconditioned                  
              afferent inputs using activity-dependent dye uptake and                        
              extracellular recordings; and 2) to assess which of these sites                
              of convergence are essential to the generation of the conditioned              
              response using reversible lesions.  These highly exploratory                   
              studies will provide a significant advance in our understanding                
              of the cellular bases of synaptic integration underlying motor                 
              control learning, which is of global relevance to processes                    
              fundamental to behaviorally adaptive motor control.
