Abstract    :
              Large order eigenproblems arise in a variety of applications.  The             
              long computing times and large storage requirements of these problems          
              motivate development of fast serial and efficient parallel                     
              eigensolvers.  New numerical methods will be investigated for                  
              computing all eigenvalues and eigenvectors of real unsymmetric                 
              tridiagonal matrices that arise in applications and from reduction of          
              general real matrices.  The immediate goal is to provide new methods           
              for the tridiagonal case.  Because current methods for the general             
              eigenproblem can suffer from parallel inefficiency or numerical                
              instability, the larger goal is to develop accurate parallel methods           
              that might ultimately be extended to the general eigenproblem without          
              initial reduction to tridiagonal form.                                         
                                                                                             
              The research derives from methods that have been successful for the            
              symmetric tridiagonal eigenproblem.  The work will begin with a study          
              of parallel methods for computing eigenvectors of an unsymmetric               
              tridiagonal matrix given its computed eigenvalues.  It will continue           
              by developing divide and conquer methods to compute both eigenvalues           
              and eigenvectors of an unsymmetric tridiagonal matrix.  It will                
              conclude with a mechanism for roughly locating the eigenvalues of any          
              tridiagonal matrix.  The latter technique is geared toward                     
              accelerating rootfinding methods for computing eigenvalues.  Serial            
              and parallel algorithms will be designed, implemented, and tested for          
              all approaches.
