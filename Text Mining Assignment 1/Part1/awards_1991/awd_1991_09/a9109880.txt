Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research will examine patterns of coordinations between the               
              arms as people engage in simple (e.g., two arms moving at one                  
              tempo) and complex (e.g., juggling) rhythmic activities. Its                   
              objective is twofold, (1) to identify the dynamical principles by              
              which rhythmic coordinations between the limbs can be both stable              
              and adaptive and (2) to understand how these principles affect                 
              how the person controls, perceives new aspects of, and learns                  
              these coordinations.  Some experiments will manipulate the phase               
              relation between limbs, the frequencies at which they move                     
              together, and the frequencies at which they move alone.  Others                
              will involve skilled juggling under conditions which manipulate                
              variables of the juggled objects and the juggling pattern.  The                
              data will be collected using three-dimensional motion analyzers                
              and addressed using the theory and methods of nonlinear dynamics.              
              The results should provide useful constraints on modeling                      
              coordination and contribute to the understanding of rhythmic                   
              movement disorders.
