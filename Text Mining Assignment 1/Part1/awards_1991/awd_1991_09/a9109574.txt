Abstract    :
              This proposal studies the problem arising when countries disagree              
              over their beliefs about how fast global warming is occurring.  The            
              objective is to understand how this divergence of beliefs affects              
              the kinds of international agreements that are likely to be adopted            
              and to explore formats or mechanisms that might lead to better                 
              international solutions even if no consensus on probabilities                  
              exists.  The study also aims to pinpoint the kinds of agreements               
              that might be possible given the current range of beliefs and                  
              mitigation costs.  The major part of the project is a decision                 
              theory model of international environmental policies when                      
              probability beliefs differ.  We study this in the context of a                 
              particular set of international environmental policies that are                
              likely to be considered.  The second part of the project is a                  
              beginning empirical analysis of the distribution of beliefs and                
              mitigation costs across countries.  Most of these estimates should             
              be available from other sources, and this project hopes to uncover             
              some straightforward empirical relationships among countries'                  
              environmental policies with respect to global warming.
