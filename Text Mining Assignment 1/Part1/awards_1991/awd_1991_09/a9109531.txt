Abstract    :
              This research will investigate the application of data flow testing to         
              integration in order to assist in validating procedure interfaces and          
              procedure interaction for programs written in procedural languages             
              such as Pascal, Modula-2, and Fortran.  This work will include the             
              development of techniques to compute interprocedural definition-use            
              information, techniques to determine whether a particular test case            
              exercises a definition-use pair, and techniques to incrementally               
              update both the interprocedural data flow information and the test             
              coverage information for regression testing.  Issues such as handling          
              reference parameters, global variable, aliases, nested scoping and             
              recursion will be considered.  A prototype system for integration data         
              flow testing will be implemented and used to perform experiments to            
              study the efficiency and effectiveness of interprocedural data flow            
              testing.  The main benefit of the proposed work is that it will                
              provide significant advances over existing integration test data               
              selection techniques for both initial and regression testing.
