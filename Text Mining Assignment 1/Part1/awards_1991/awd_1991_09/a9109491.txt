Abstract    :
                   In this project the principal investigator will study the                 
              SU(2) Yang-Mills-Higgs equations in three-space in the case of a               
              positive coupling constant.  Her goal is to show the existence of              
              non-minimal finite-action critical points of the SU(2) Yang-Mills-             
              Higgs functional in three-space with arbitrary positive coupling               
              constant, thereby extending the work of Taubes for the case of zero            
              coupling constant.  Taubes was able to establish a form of the                 
              Liusternik-Schnirelman min-max theory that applies to the                      
              variational problems in three-space that arise in gauge theory.                
              The principal investigator hopes to establish a similar result that            
              applies in the case of positive coupling constant.                             
              She will collaborate with Taubes and other experts in the course of            
              her research.                                                                  
                   Gauge theory is now one of the fundamental areas in                       
              mathematical physics. It contains a number of deep and important               
              problems that are of interest to mathematicians and physicists.                
              One of these problems involves the properties of finite-action                 
              solutions of certain variational equations that arise in the Yang-             
              Mills theory in three-space.  The principal investigator will focus            
              on an important problem in this area, namely showing the existence             
              of non-minimal finite-action critical points of the Yang-Mills                 
              functional in the case when the coupling constant is positive.
