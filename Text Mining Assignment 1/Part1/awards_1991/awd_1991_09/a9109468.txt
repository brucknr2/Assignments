Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A basic feature of all predator-prey interactions is the trade-                
              off between predator ability to locate prey and prey ability to                
              avoid predators.  Spiders that weave aerial webs and their insect              
              prey are an ideal system for exploring this trade-off.  A web,                 
              the physical manifestation of the foraging mode of a predator,                 
              can be manipulated and the response of the prey can be                         
              quantified.  Moreover, while most studies on predator-prey                     
              interactions focus on the effect of predators on prey                          
              populations, studies on spiders and insects should yield insight               
              into mechanisms of co-evolution.                                               
                                                                                             
              Dr. Craig's research is designed to show how the avoidance                     
              behavior of prey may affect the foraging modes of a predator.                  
              Specifically, she asks (1) if the ability of insects to learn and              
              remember web locations is inhibited by the day-to-day variation                
              in the web decorations spun by a species of tropical spider, (2)               
              if color and design of the decorations are equally important in                
              attracting prey, and (3) if stingless bees that have learned to                
              avoid one type of spider web are able to recognize and avoid webs              
              spun by other spider species that differ in architecture but are               
              spun from silks with similar spectral properties.                              
                                                                                             
              This research will take an initial step in studying the                        
              perceptual capabilities and behaviors of insects that may have                 
              affected the evolution of the aerial-web-weaving foraging mode.                
              The results will be of general interest to investigators studying              
              insect perception, learning, and foraging behavior and to those                
              interested in the evolution of predator-prey interactions.
