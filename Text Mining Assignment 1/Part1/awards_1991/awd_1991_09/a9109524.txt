Abstract    :
              The goal is to measure nuclear-quadrupole-interaction effects in               
              pure metals at temperatures below lmK.  To date, little work has               
              been done below 4K.  The large exchange interaction present in                 
              quadrupolar systems makes the latter good candidates for ultralow-             
              temperature studies of nuclear spin magnetism.  Proposed planning              
              activities comprise an 18-month detailed study of quadrupolar                  
              interactions in a variety of systems.
