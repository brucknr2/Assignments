Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to develop methods for the                    
              verification  of highly complex communications protocol required for           
              current and future network engineering problems.  The problem of               
              protocol verification is computationally complex.  This research               
              focuses on ways to employ scalable parallelism to provide the                  
              necessary computational resources.  Initial research has been                  
              conducted on parallel protocol verification algorithms based on the            
              relational algebra.  The project will expand on the earlier work by            
              applying two level parallelism.  New algorithms will be developed and          
              implemented on an Intel iPSC/2 hypercube.  This project will also              
              investigate the specification and parallel verification of protocols           
              written in Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP).  A prototype              
              system will be developed.
