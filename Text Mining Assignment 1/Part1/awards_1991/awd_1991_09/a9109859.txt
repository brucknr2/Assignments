Abstract    :
              The frequent and conventional use of non-literal language has                  
              been a major stumbling block for natural languages processing                  
              systems since the early machine translator efforts.  Metaphor,                 
              metonymy and indirect speech acts are among the most troublesome               
              phenomena,  Recent computational efforts addressing these                      
              problems have taken an approach that emphasizes the use of                     
              systematic knowledge about non-literal language convention.  This              
              work will construct the MetaBank,: an empirically derived and                  
              theoretically motivated knowledge-base of English metaphorical                 
              conventions.  More generally, this effort can be seen as an                    
              attempt to develop methodologies for empirically capturing                     
              language conventions in usable knowledge-base forms.
