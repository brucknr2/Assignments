Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The proposed research examines the determinants of public school               
              teacher salaries in the state of California.  During the planning              
              period, the study estimates the relationships between wages and                
              characteristics of the teachers, school districts, students, and               
              parents.  Lifetime wage profiles are evaluated with reference to               
              human capital, agency, and median voter theories.  The study tests             
              three hypotheses on union behavior: whether unions decrease the                
              dispersion of wages, whether unions increase labor's share of total            
              costs, and whether unions increase the share of compensation                   
              allocated to fringe benefits.  The research also investigates the              
              adequacy of conventional empirical approaches to wage determination            
              in markets characterized by explicit contracts.                                
                                                                                             
              This research will both increase our understanding of salary                   
              variation under explicit contracts and serve as the basis for a                
              behavioral model of wage and employment determination in a                     
              unionized market.  Such a model will let policy makers predict the             
              union and school district responses to changes in the district's               
              exogenous budget constraint and calculate the effects of an                    
              increase in state educational expenditures on teacher salaries and             
              class size.
