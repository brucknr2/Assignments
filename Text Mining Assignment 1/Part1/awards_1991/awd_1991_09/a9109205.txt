Abstract    :
              This is a Research Planning Grant for Women Scientists and                     
              Engineers.  A research program in determining the relationship                 
              between structural and physical interconnect in IC design is being             
              planned.  Typical area estimates for the structural design of an               
              IC count the number and size of the structural modules, but ignores            
              interconnect, which can use significant chip space.  The approach              
              is to design experiments which explore the relationships between               
              register-transfer (RT) measures and area devoted to interconnects.             
              Experiments are being conducted with designs produced by IC                    
              synthesis tools and statistical evaluation is being used to                    
              determine correlations.  The first experiment is to establish                  
              relationships between the RT design and the physical design                    
              independent of particular cell bindings.  The second experiment is             
              to determine if a relationship exists among RT measures and                    
              interconnect area, and to characterize that relationship.
