Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research will explore the basis for the subjective                        
              experiences associated with memory, question answering, and                    
              evaluation.  The research is guided by a model in which such                   
              experiences depend on an inference about the ease with which                   
              ideas come to mind.                                                            
                                                                                             
              One set of experiments will investigate whether the experience of              
              remembering is based on the ease with which ideas come to mind                 
              during recall attempts.  The particular ideas that come to mind                
              during recall will be manipulated independently of the actual to-              
              be-remembered events, thereby creating memory illusions.  Other                
              experiments will investigate whether the experience of confidence              
              in answers to world knowledge questions and the evaluation of the              
              difficulty of questions is based on the ease with which answers                
              come to mind.  Prior exposure to the right or wrong answers will               
              make those answers come to mind readily in response to the                     
              questions, thereby creating illusions of knowing and                           
              underestimations of question difficulty.  The research will add                
              to our understanding of the factors that create errors of memory               
              and judgment in a variety of domains, including education,                     
              eyewitness testimony, and clinical memory disorders.
