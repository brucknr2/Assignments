Abstract    :
              This is a Research Planning Grant for Women Scientists and                     
              Engineers.  A research program in automating the synthesis of the              
              VHDL language from a very high-level architectural specification               
              is being planned.  The approach is to transition state-of-the-art              
              software synthesis technology to CAD design automation.  A                     
              feasibility study of several high-level architectural specification            
              models, which are implementation independent, is being conducted.              
              Other activities are:  defining a set of VHDL software synthesis               
              operators, developing representations of pure behavioral level                 
              architectural specifications, and performing feasibility tests of              
              these specifications.
