Abstract    :
              Study of recently-erupted lavas from Kiluea volcano in Hawaii                  
              have shown that for individual samples, paleo magnetic directions              
              may deviate from the orientation of the actual magnetic field by               
              as much as several degrees.  This project will study this                      
              discrepancy by: 1) Monitoring the local geomagnetic field while                
              samples cool through the Curie temperature; 2) Laboratory work on              
              stressed and unstressed cooled samples that have been collected                
              specifically for this purpose; 3) Melting and cooling lava under               
              controlled laboratory conditions and measuring the magnetic                    
              field.  The results should benefit a wide spectrum of earth                    
              scientists including volcanologists, paleo magneticists, age                   
              daters, etc.
