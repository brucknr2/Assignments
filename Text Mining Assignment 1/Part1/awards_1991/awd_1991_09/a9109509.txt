Abstract    :
                   The proposed research focuses on building vision systems                  
              with supercomputer capability into fast, small, low-power, analog              
              integrated circuits.  Examples where visual acuity and dexterity               
              would be useful in products include collision sensors for cars,                
              ground speed detectors for anti-skid lock brakes, navigation                   
              systems for mobile robots, perception sensors for micro robots                 
              and image pre-processors for remote sensing instruments.  Current              
              supercomputers are too large, too general and too complex to be                
              cost-effective for such applications.  Vision algorithms will be               
              implemented directly in silicon through analog networks.                       
              Computation performed this way is the ultimate in parallelism, is              
              inherently low power and compiles to a very small package size                 
              because sensors can be integrated directly with computational                  
              networks.  Single chip sensor systems to be useful in the real                 
              world however, must be adaptive and self-calibrating.  Designing               
              adaptive, flexible, smart sensors requires extensive simulation.               
              In fact, for simulations to complete in any reasonable time                    
              frame, computational assets on the order of supercomputer                      
              capability are essential.  The research proposed is to utilize                 
              today's general purpose supercomputers to develop the appropriate              
              algorithms for designing tomorrow's application specific single-               
              chip supercomputers (analog vision chips).  The Connection                     
              Machine, a 64,000 processor supercomputer, will be used for                    
              algorithm simulation and device design of these self-calibrating,              
              adaptive vision chips.                                                         
                   Standard computer vision algorithms bog down even the                     
              fastest computers in the world.  For most vision applications,                 
              commercial supercomputers would not be feasible.  For example, an              
              automobile collision detection system must be small, low-cost,                 
              and consume little power.  For such applications, general-purpose              
              supercomputers would not be satisfactory (even if they were fast               
              enough).  The solution is to utilize special-purpose custom                    
              analog VLSI chips.  These analog chips are fast, low-power, cheap              
              and small.  I have successfully built and tested more than a                   
              dozen different analog VLSI chips during my Ph.D. work at                      
              Caltech.  These chips perform various smoothing, segmentation and              
              interpolation algorithms using input from on-chip photosensors or              
              scanned-in test data.  Recently I am investigating some simple                 
              motion and stereo ideas.
