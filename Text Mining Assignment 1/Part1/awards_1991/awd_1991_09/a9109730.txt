Abstract    :
              This project is supported under the Research in Undergraduate                  
              Institutions Program.  The purpose of this research is to analyze              
              the substitutability of public and private spending in the United              
              States.  This is a very important issue because the degree of                  
              substitutability has major implications for macroeconomic policy.              
              If consumers view public outlays as close substitutes for their own            
              personal expenditures, then increases in government spending could             
              result in commensurate decreases in private spending, nullifying               
              the expansionary impact of the fiscal policy.                                  
                                                                                             
              The project will examine this issue at the disaggregated level.                
              Statistical analyses looking for significant correlations between              
              the different components of government and consumer expenditures               
              will be undertaken.  This will help to determine what underlies                
              the aggregate relationship between public and private spending.                
              The plausibility of the correlations at the disaggregated level                
              should help determine whether any relationship that exists at the              
              aggregate level is reasonable or is the result of spurious                     
              correlation.
