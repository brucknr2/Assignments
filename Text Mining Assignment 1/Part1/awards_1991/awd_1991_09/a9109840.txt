Abstract    :
              The purpose of this research is to determine and analyze how family            
              obligations influence the job mobility of women.  In recent years,             
              it has become recognized that job turnover is an important                     
              criterion for career success.  A certain amount of early career                
              turnover is regarded as beneficial because it can lead to finding              
              a lucrative job, but too much job change may indicate that workers             
              are failing to invest in job-specific skill that enhance their wage            
              growth.  Surprisingly, little is known about the extent to which               
              women change jobs, let alone how their mobility is affected by                 
              fertility decisions.   This research is important because it will              
              shed light on one of the factors that may account for persistent               
              male-female wage differentials.                                                
                                                                                             
              To accomplish the research objectives, data from the National                  
              Longitudinal Surveys of Labor Market Experiences will be analyzed,             
              primarily via the estimation of discrete-time proportional hazard              
              models.  The analysis will reveal how various measures of fertility            
              and past career interruptions influence the job-to-job hazard rate             
              as well as the nonemployment-to nonemployment hazard rate.  In                 
              addition, the characteristics of women's career interruptions will             
              be described, and the personal characteristics of women who                    
              interrupt their careers will be compared to the characteristics of             
              those who work continuously.  Special emphasis will be placed on               
              race and cohort differences in turnover behavior.
