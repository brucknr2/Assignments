Abstract    :
              Although powerful, the transaction model adopted in traditional                
              database systems is found lacking in functionality and                         
              performance when used for applications that involve reactive,                  
              long-lived and collaborative activities.  The following are some               
              of the issues that arise in the context of the extended                        
              transaction models that have been proposed to address this lack:               
              correctness properties of a model vis a vis visibility,                        
              consistency, recovery, and permanence (e.g., traditional                       
              transactions guarantee failure atomicity, serializability, and                 
              permanence.); similarities  and differences between two                        
              transaction models; constraints on using two models in                         
              conjunction; and, mechanisms needed for managing extended                      
              transactions.  These issues motivated the development of ACTA, a               
              comprehensive formalism which characterizes the effects of                     
              transactions on each other and on objects in the database.                     
              ACTA's ability to deal with existing extended transaction models               
              and correctness notions is indicative of its generality.  The                  
              need for extended transactions emerges from the demands of                     
              applications, such as CAD/CAM, software development environments,              
              object-oriented databases, and distributed operating systems. By               
              providing a formal framework in which to capture the properties                
              of extended transactions, and thereby identifying the needed                   
              transaction management mechanisms, this work is producing results              
              that will impact these information-intensive application areas.
