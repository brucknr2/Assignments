Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Movement is the result of coordinated activity in several                 
              areas of the central nervous system.  One of the important relay               
              structures is the thalamic reticular nucleus, which has                        
              connections both other motor thalamic nuclei and with                          
              extrathalamic sites such as the cortex, cerebellum and basal                   
              ganglia.  Drs. Ilinsky and Kultas-Ilinsky will study the                       
              connections of the reticular thalamic nucleus by using methods                 
              for tracing neuronal circuitry.  Neuronal and synaptic                         
              organization will be analyzed at both light and electron                       
              microscopic levels.  The neurochemical characteristics of                      
              transmitter substances in the neurons of the thalamic reticular                
              nucleus will serve as markers to identify the extrinsic and                    
              intrinsic connections of these nerve cells.  These studies are                 
              important because they will increase basic knowledge about motor               
              system control.
