Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Functions of the nerve growth cone will be analyzed at the                     
              molecular level, in particular, processes involved in motility                 
              and plasmalemmal growth.  The proteins associated with three                   
              different membrane subfactions of growth cones, plasmalemmal                   
              precursor vesicles, large dense-core vesicles and the plasmalemma              
              will be analyzed.  To  study membrane-cytoskeletal interactions                
              and their regulation, the cytoskeletal ligand for the proto-                   
              oncogene product, pp60c-src, and a pp60csrc-associated membrane                
              phosphoprotein will be characterized.  These studies promise to                
              provide new insights into the mechanisms that direct nervous                   
              system assembly during development.
