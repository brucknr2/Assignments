Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to develop algorithms that will               
              enable intelligent imaging add vision systems to operate robustly              
              and rapidly with very noisy sensor data.  Current methods perform              
              poorly in this regime due to a lack of well-defined optimality                 
              properties, `brittleness' of the underlying  discrete                          
              representations, and a deluge of processing inconsistencies and                
              noise artifacts.  The improved performance is achieved by a                    
              cooperative solution of low-level signal processing and high-                  
              level object recognition tasks subject to numeric and symbolic                 
              constraints, instead of the classical sequential processing                    
              method.  The overall approach is Bayesian, and is formulated as                
              the minimization of an energy surface.  All the image-processing               
              operations result automatically as by products of a gradient-                  
              based optimization process.  This includes the synergistic                     
              interaction of low and high-level variables, satisfaction of                   
              pattern constraints, and feedback of high-level modelling                      
              information.  From an architectural standpoint, the proposed                   
              method offers a valuable uniform strategy for parallel                         
              computation, which is duly exploited.  This work is expected to                
              fundamentally impact applications that are required to operate                 
              with noisy sensor data in a limited time frame.  Encouraging                   
              preliminary results have been computed on a DAP massively-                     
              parallel processor.
