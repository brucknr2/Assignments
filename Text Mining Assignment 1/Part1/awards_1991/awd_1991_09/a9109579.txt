Abstract    :
              This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic                   
              Program is made to Dr. Marcetta Y. Darensbourg of the Chemistry                
              Department, Texas A&M University, for fundamental work on the                  
              chemistry of transition metal complexes containing both                        
              hydrogen and sulfur-containing ligands.  The goal of the                       
              research is to find direct evidence for some of the individual                 
              steps in S-H, C-S and C-H activation by nickel, iron, and                      
              cobalt.  Specifically Darensbourg plans to investigate the                     
              mechanism of four types of reactions: metal hydrides with                      
              organosulfur reagents; dihydrogen release from hydrido-thiolate                
              complexes of iron and nickel; oxidation-reduction of                           
              sulfur-bound nickel complexes with various ligand environments;                
              and transition metal promoted heterolysis of metal-proximate                   
              C-H bonds.  In the studies of sulfur-bound nickel complexes,                   
              dependence of the oxidation potential and of the oxidative                     
              addition of hydrogen on the presence of sulfur and phosphorus                  
              ligands will be investigated.                                                  
              %%%                                                                            
              The results of these experiments are relevant to the action of                 
              hydrogenase enzymes in methanogenic bacteria and heterogeneous                 
              hydrodesulfurization catalysts, in which reaction mechanisms                   
              involving simultaneous bonding of sulfur and hydrogen have been                
              proposed.
