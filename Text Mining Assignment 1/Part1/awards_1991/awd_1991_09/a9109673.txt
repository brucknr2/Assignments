Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Cardiovascular and respiratory functions are regulated by nerve                
              cells in an area of the brainstem called the nucleus of the                    
              solitary tract. Dr. Barnes' research is aimed at recording activity            
              in this area of the brainstem in order to determine how it                     
              functions. Hypotension and bradycardia can be produced by                      
              application of two neuropeptides, substance P and angiotensin II,              
              into this area. The interactions of these two substances and their             
              effects on autonomic nervous system functioning will be studied.               
              This research will contribute to understanding the role of                     
              neuropeptides in the control cardiovascular and respiratory                    
              functions.
