Abstract    :
              This project is for Phase I of                                                 
              upgrades to the Structural and                                                 
              Geotechnical Research laboratories                                             
              at the University of Washington.                                               
              The total cost is being co-shared by

              The project covers two parallel                                                
              undertakings.  Renovating the

              performance so that it is suitable                                             
              for both structural and geotechnical                                           
              work.  The remainder of the funds                                              
              will provide a set of modular steel                                            
              beams and columns with which to                                                
              construct demountable test rigs for                                            
              use on the tie-down test floor.
