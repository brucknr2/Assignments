Abstract    :
                   The objective of this research is to formulate strategies for             
              resource allocation, control and pricing in communication networks             
              that offer multiple services using shared resources. It is                     
              expected that these problems will become significant as networks               
              continue to integrate diversified services.  The Principal                     
              Investigator is modeling such a multiple service, multiple                     
              resource system, analyzing strategies for managing the system                  
              through control of service requests and pricing of services, and               
              designing a set of algorithms to specify these strategies.  The                
              initial part of the research uses existing theories of Markov                  
              chains; the latter part draws from a richer domain of stochastic               
              processes.  The effort exposes issues and strategies for managing              
              communication networks in particular, and contributes to modeling              
              and analysis of any multiple service, multiple resource system in              
              general.  The research will be evaluated by the information                    
              content of the resulting control and pricing rules and by the                  
              complexity of the resulting algorithms.
