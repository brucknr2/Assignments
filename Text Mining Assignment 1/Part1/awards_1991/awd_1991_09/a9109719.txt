Abstract    :
                 This is a Research Planning Grant to enable Dr. Lowery to                   
              initiate studies aimed at establishing myogenic cells of fish                  
              muscle (satellite cells) in culture.  Such cell cultures should                
              subsequently prove to be invaluable tools for the study of                     
              myogenesis in fish.                                                            
                                                                                             
              It is anticipated that this award will help Dr. Lowery obtain the              
              preliminary results necessary to launch an independent research                
              career.
