Abstract    :
              This  award provides funds to aid in the purchase of optical                   
              microscopy equipment.  The equipment will be located in a                      
              central facility where it will be available to a group of                      
              neuroscientists in the Keck Center for Integrative                             
              Neuroscience.  The scientists are all interested in various                    
              aspects of local circuit analysis of the mammalian central                     
              nervous system (CNS).  The goal of their studies is an                         
              improved understanding of how small groups of neurons                          
              generate behavior.  The instruments requested will be used                     
              for combined anatomical and physiological studies of brain                     
              function that include the use of double or triple labeling                     
              techniques.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              The development of new instrumentation for optical                             
              microscopy and of new methods that permit specific labeling                    
              of certain cells or certain cell constituents has been key                     
              to progress in our understanding of many aspects of cellular                   
              and developmental biology.  Neuroscience has benefited                         
              greatly from these developments, since they permit the rapid                   
              and reliable identification of particular neurons or groups                    
              of neurons in the brain or at other sites that typically                       
              contain many nerve cells or similar morphology.
