Abstract    :
                   Theoretical research in astrophysics will be concerned                    
              with the large scale structure of the universe and with the                    
              nature of the dark matter in the universe.  The astrophysical                  
              production of axions, which could be a dominant component of                   
              the dark matter, will be probed.  The generation of primordial                 
              density fluctuations (which could eventually lead to the                       
              presently-observed large scale structure) by topological                       
              defects such as magnetic monopoles will be studied.  The                       
              possibility that some of the observed large scale structure is                 
              not real but a result of the limitations of observing                          
              techniques will be explored.  These projects are important to                  
              our efforts to understand the large - scale nature of the                      
              universe.
