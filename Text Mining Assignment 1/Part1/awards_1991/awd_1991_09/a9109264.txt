Abstract    :
              This is an Research Opportunities for Women Career Advancement                 
              Award for 12 months duration.  The Principal Investigator will                 
              investigate kinetics of Phase Transformations in Alloys using a                
              realistic microscopic Hamiltonian.  The Hamiltonian is derived from            
              the effective medium theory of chemical binding.  The project is               
              designed to help the principal investigator acquire expertise in               
              the techniques used to studying kinetics of phase transitions and              
              critical phenomena.
