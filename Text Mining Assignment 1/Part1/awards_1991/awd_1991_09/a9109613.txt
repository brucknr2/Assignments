Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This Research Planning Grant award will allow Dr. M. Lynne                     
              McAnelly to work in the laboratory of Dr. Harold Zakon at the                  
              University of Texas at Austin in order to develop her independent              
              research program.  The acquisition of membrane properties of                   
              cells of the electric organ of a weak electric fish will be                    
              studied to determine whether cells switch from membrane                        
              properties characteristic of muscle cells to those of neural                   
              cells.  This award will provide  Dr. McAnelly with training and                
              experience needed to pursue an independent career in                           
              developmental neurophysiology.
