Abstract    :
              This research seeks to establish a preferred interconnection network           
              for massively parallel computers of the future.  Such a network must           
              have modestly increasing hardware requirements as the number of                
              processors increases but also must efficiently support general                 
              patterns of communication.  Hardware cost is equated with physical             
              space under a model accounting for minimum width and spacing rules for         
              wires.  This is in keeping with the common use of area as a cost               
              measure for chips.  Particular attention will be given to ensuring             
              that general-purpose communication capabilities hold up even when              
              interprocessor distances are large and when faults are introduced.             
              This work will employ both mathematical proof and simulation of                
              proposed networks.  The choice of a preferred general-purpose                  
              interconnection network will allow for the development of more                 
              portable and long-lasting parallel algorithms and programs.
