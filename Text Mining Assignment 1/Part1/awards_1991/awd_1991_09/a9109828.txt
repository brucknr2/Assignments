Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This project studies English language acquisition among                   
              Hispanic immigrants and native citizens, relating skill to                     
              various social factors.  It advances such studies partly through               
              use of an actual measure (rather than subjective estimate) of                  
              English skill, and partly through focusing on social factors such              
              as family and friends as facilitators of acquisition.  Other                   
              factors whose impact are measured include amount of schooling,                 
              opportunities to use Spanish outside the home, and several                     
              aspects of culture.  The study advances demographic understanding              
              of how language patterns develop in the U.S.  Results should have              
              application in designing immigration policies and educational                  
              programs.
