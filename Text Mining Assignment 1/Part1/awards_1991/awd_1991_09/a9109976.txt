Abstract    :
                   The project implements an Industry/University/Government                  
              Cooperative Research Program between the United States and the                 
              United Kingdom.  The program will couple the New Jersey Institute              
              of Technology in the US with the Queens University of Belfast in               
              the UK.  The ultimate objective of this joint effort is to couple              
              the Environmental Science and Technology Research Center at Queens             
              University, (established in 1989) with the I/UCRC for Hazardous                
              Waste Management at NJIT.  The joint research program is to study              
              the potential of lignite and lignite derived activated carbons as              
              solid absorbents to provide a support-matrix for treatment of waste            
              water streams using microbiological process to degrade organic                 
              toxic constituents.                                                            
                   Additional support is provided for an evaluation activity in              
              studying the industry/university interaction occurring in both                 
              Centers as well as the interaction between the Centers.                        
                   The British Science and Engineering Research Council has                  
              reviewed and funded the Irish (UK) component of this collaborative             
              effort at approximately $240,000 over a three year period.                     
                   The Program Manager recommends that the New Jersey Institute              
              of Technology be awarded $80,000 for first year of a three-year                
              continuing award.  This project is being coordinated with the                  
              National Science Foundation's Division of International Programs.              
              Also, $8,000 is awarded for the first year of three-year continuing            
              award for an evaluator function.
