Abstract    :
              The planning grant involves a study of low molecular weight                    
              oligomers formed in the electrochemical polymerization of                      
              methylphenyldichlorosilane.  The major focus will be on the                    
              separation and identification of the oligomers which have                      
              degrees of polymerization (DP) of 2, 3 and 4 with particular                   
              emphasis on the diastereomers formed at each stage of the                      
              oligomerization.  This preliminary research will be carried out                
              in two stages: 1.  Optimization of conditions for the                          
              separation of the low molecular weight oligomers on both an                    
              analytical and a preparative scale.  The oligomers will be                     
              obtained from the dehydrodimerization of methylphenylsilane.                   
              The optimum conditions for the separation of low molecular                     
              weight oligomers and their diastereomers by HPLC will be                       
              determined along with the use of flash chromatography for                      
              preparative scale separation of the oligomers.  2. Optimization                
              of conditions for the electrochemical oligomerization of                       
              methylphenyldichlorosilane.  The electrochemical polymerization                
              of methylphenyldichlorosilane will be carried out according to                 
              the method of Dunogues with the exception that the production                  
              of the low molecular weight oligomers will be followed by HPLC                 
              as the reaction proceeds.  The reaction conditions will be                     
              varied in order to maximize the yields of the oligomers with DP                
              = 2, 3 and 4.  Isomers will be separated and characterized.

              Research Planning Grants enable women who have not had prior                   
              independent Federal research support to develop a competitive                  
              research project.  This project involves the electrochemical                   
              polymerization of organochlorosilanes and their subsequent                     
              characterization by chromatography.
