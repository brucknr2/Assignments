Abstract    :
              Admissible heuristics are an important class of heuristics worth               
              discovering:  They guarantee shortest path solutions in search                 
              algorithms such as A* and they guarantee less expensively                      
              produced solutions with a bounded increase in solution path                    
              length in search algorithms such as dynamic weighing.  Several                 
              researchers have described how admissible heuristics can be                    
              generated from abstracted versions of a given problem, ones from               
              which certain details have been removed.  This work aims to                    
              develop a quantitative theory that relates abstractness to the                 
              effectiveness of the resulting heuristics and them empirically                 
              validate that theory.  Such a theory will enable us to predict                 
              how much complexity reduction can be expected from using                       
              abstraction-derived heuristics.  Ultimately, this theory will                  
              result in a better understanding of how effective admissible                   
              heuristics can be automatically discovered.//
