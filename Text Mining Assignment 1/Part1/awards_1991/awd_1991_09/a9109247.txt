Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Understanding the basic mechanisms underlying the perception and               
              control of pain signals originating from the oro-facial region is              
              the aim of Dr. Mokha's research program.  While it is known that               
              the processing of pain signals from the oro-facial region takes                
              place initially in the dorsal horn of the medulla (trigeminal                  
              nucleus caudalis) and is relayed to higher centers of the brain                
              involved in the perception of pain,  Dr. Mokha will delineate the              
              importance of opiates and opiod peptides in modulating pain                    
              transmission.  These opiates and opioid peptides are morphine                  
              like compounds localized in these brain regions.  Moreover, he                 
              will determine the contribution of pathways descending from the                
              hypothalamus to the dorsal horn in modulating pain signals                     
              originating from the oro-facial region.  The new knowledge gained              
              from these type of work will eventually lead to the development                
              of new and better strategies for controlling clinical pain states              
              such as trigeminal neuralgia (tic douloureux), migraine and other              
              debilitating pains associated with spinal cord or peripheral                   
              nerve injuries and other disease processes.  Understanding the                 
              neural mechanisms and neurochemicals that underlie the modulation              
              of pain signals in the dorsal horn should lead to the development              
              of new non-addictive analgesic drugs for the treatment of pain.
