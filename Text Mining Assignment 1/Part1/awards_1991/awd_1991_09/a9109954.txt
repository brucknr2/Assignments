Abstract    :
              In the proposed work key design and                                            
              implementation issues will be addressed which will                             
              make free-space optics a more viable interconnect                              
              alternative at the board interconnection level.  The                           
              major goals of this work are to: a) Develop a layout                           
              and design program which includes relevant optical                             
              and electrical properties of free space optical                                
              interconnects.  b) Combine the alignment                                       
              properties of lithographically formed binary optical                           
              elements with the high spatial frequency recording                             
              capability and single exposure formation properties                            
              of volume gratings.  c) Evaluate methods to reduce                             
              misalignment effects of free space beams                                       
              propagating between boards, and establish a                                    
              minimal set of substrate-mode holographic                                      
              interconnects for distributing signals in the plane of                         
              the board.  d) Develop and evaluate alignment and                              
              packaging techniques for stacked optical systems                               
              with electronic processor elements.  e) Use the                                
              interconnect design model to build a board level                               
              interconnect system which transfers data in parallel                           
              between three boards.  The interconnect locations                              
              on boards will be optimized to reduce latency                                  
              effects.
