Abstract    :
              With this grant in the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry                 
              Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Yang will develop                 
              theoretical and computational methods for computing the                        
              electronic structure of large molecules based on density                       
              functional theory.  He will extend recent progress along the                   
              following two directions: (1) The direct calculation of                        
              electron density without using molecular orbitals will be                      
              undertaken by a newly developed "divide and conquer" algorithm.                
              This method divides the molecule into subsystems and determines                
              the total electron density and energy as the sum of all                        
              subsystem contributions. It is, in addition, well-suited for                   
              parallel computation. Effort will be made to implement the                     
              theory on massively parallel computers, with each processor                    
              handling one subsystem. (2) A more efficient way of                            
              implementing the solution of the  Kohn-Sham density functional                 
              equations will be developed by making use of a local projection                
              method.                                                                        
                                                                                             
              %%%                                                                            
                                                                                             
              The new algorithms which will be developed in this project will                
              enhance the predictive power of density functional theory and                  
              will make possible theoretical studies of complex chemical and                 
              biological phenomena that are otherwise impossible by                          
              conventional methods.
