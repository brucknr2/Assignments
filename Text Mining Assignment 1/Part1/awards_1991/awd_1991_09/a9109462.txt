Abstract    :
              Mobility endonucleases are known to promote gene conversion events             
              in a broad range of organisms including yeast, the T-even                      
              bacteriophages T2, T4 and T6, the acellular slime mold Physarum                
              polycephalum and the green algae Chlamydomonas.  They present a                
              minimum of two new classes of DNA-cleavage proteins based on                   
              analysis of their complex recognition sites and their amino acid               
              sequences.  Their role in intra-species gene conversion events has             
              already been established, while their potential involvement in                 
              horizontal gene transfer and in mitochondrially related fungal                 
              senescence is under investigation.  The objective of this research             
              planning grant is to first establish a working system of genetic               
              and molecular techniques and assays to study the intron-encoded                
              mitochondrial endonucleases in Podospora anserina, and to initiate             
              the proposed study with a specific endonuclease candidate.  These              
              preliminary efforts will provide the basis for additional studies              
              that will 1) address the frequency of mobility endonucleases within            
              the mitochondria of Podospora, 2) characterize selected                        
              endonucleases in regard to their substrate requirements and                    
              specificity, 3) study the expression and regulation of these                   
              proteins and their function in the mitochondria, 4) develop                    
              techniques to look at the possible acquisition of introns and their            
              mobility endonucleases via horizontal transfer, and 5) assess their            
              possible role in senescence- a curious aging process that Podospora            
              exhibit during culture.
