Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              This research concerns allocation in simple private goods                      
              situations such as assignment of transmission capacity in a                    
              computer network.  A strong case can be made that in such problems             
              (i) non manipulability (i.e., dominant strategies) is a very                   
              desirable property, (ii) replacing the requirement of Pareto                   
              efficiency with a fairness criterion is sensible - particularly                
              since efficiency and non manipulability are inconsistent                       
              requirements, and (iii) local serial dictatorship is acceptable                
              provided anonymity holds globally.  It has been shown that the                 
              serial social choice function satisfies these criteria.  This                  
              research is to characterize the class of mechanisms that satisfy               
              these criteria.                                                                
                                                                                             
              This project is the point of departure for a systematic analysis               
              of strategy-proof mechanisms for allocating private goods. It                  
              represents an important and exciting direction in which to increase            
              our knowledge of allocation mechanisms and their performance                   
              characteristics.  Not only does the project promise to contribute              
              to the body of economic theory in a substantial way, it will affect            
              the ways firms and public bodies allocate certain scarce productive            
              resources (such as computer networks).
