Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The mechanisms involved in the growth of axons along specific,                 
              pathways will be studied in the chick hindlimb.  Select sets of                
              neurons will be labeled in ovo with different fluorescent dyes                 
              and then removed from the embryo and studied in culture.  Two                  
              types of sensory neurons, those that innervate skin and muscle,                
              will be studied to determine if these differ in their responses                
              to contact with processes of motoneurons, expression of various                
              cell adhesion molecules and growth toward specific target                      
              tissues.  More generally, these studies promise to elucidate                   
              mechanisms involved in the development of neuronal specificity                 
              and regeneration.
