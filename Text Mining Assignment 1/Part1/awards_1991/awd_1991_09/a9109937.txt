Abstract    :
                   This grant provides partial support for a Columbia                        
              University faculty member as a Career Advancement Award.  A                    
              prototype liquid xenon time projection ionization chamber will                 
              be constructed in order to investigate the potential for such                  
              a device for use in measurements of neutrinoless double B-                     
              decay of 136Xe.
