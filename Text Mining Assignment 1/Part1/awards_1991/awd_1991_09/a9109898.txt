Abstract    :
              Under a Research Initiation Award, a novel birefringence                       
              technique will be explored for characterizing the properties                   
              of polymeric fluids. In particular, more accurate and reliable                 
                                                                                             
              measurements will be obtained for the full stress tensor,                      
              including the second normal stress difference. The technique                   
              will be applied to several phenomena in entangled linear                       
              polymer solutions, such as for example oscillatory shear.                      
              Polymeric fluids, and their characterization, play an                          
              important role in a very broad range of materials processing                   
              techniques. Optimal processing conditions would be predictable                 
                                                                                             
              with greater certainty with better materials characterization.
