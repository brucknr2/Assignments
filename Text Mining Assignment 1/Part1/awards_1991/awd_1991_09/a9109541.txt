Abstract    :
                 This is a Research Planning Grant to enable Dr. Jackson to                  
              initiate studies on the regulation of expression of the key                    
              metabolic enzyme, argininosuccinate synthetase.                                
                                                                                             
              It is anticipated that this award will help Dr. Jackson obtain                 
              preliminary results necessary to launch an independent research                
              career.
