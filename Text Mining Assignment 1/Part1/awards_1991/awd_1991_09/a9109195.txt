Abstract    :
              This research investigates the automated, static analysis of                   
              integrity maintenance rules within an active database                          
              environment.  An integrity maintenance rule is a rule that                     
              attempts to "resatisfy" a constraint by initiating corrective,                 
              state-altering database operations.  Rules that attempt to                     
              maintain conflicting or ill-specified constraints, however, can                
              lead to cyclic and anomalous rule behavior.  This research                     
              addresses the theoretical aspects and implementation details of a              
              system for reasoning about the interaction between integrity                   
              maintenance rules for the purpose of automatically identifying                 
              provably safe, provably inconsistent, and potentially                          
              inconsistent rule behaviors.  The investigation is performed in a              
              deductive, object-oriented framework, using object logics to                   
              provide a well-defined syntax and semantics. The analysis of rule              
              behavior is based on current research on constraint                            
              satisfiability and integrity checking in deductive databases,                  
              using the truth maintenance paradigm to support user interaction               
              in and explanation of the rule analysis process.  The analysis                 
              process includes rules triggered by a set of transaction                       
              operations.  An important contribution of the research is the                  
              framework it provides for the correct execution of integrity                   
              maintenance rules in an active, object-oriented environment and                
              for further refinement of execution models and run-time                        
              monitoring of active database rules, in general.
