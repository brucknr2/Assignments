Abstract    :
              This research includes a collaborative effort between                          
              the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Case                             
              Western Reserve University to continue research on                             
              flat, silicon micromotors.  The research will extend                           
              the studies of pattern definition and final release.                           
              Fabricated motors will be used to study friction and                           
              wear, and to study new materials to reduce friction                            
              and wear.  One goal of the proposed research will be                           
              the development of an improved set of micromotors.                             
              Finally, it is proposed to integrate sensors together                          
              with micromotors to produce a fully actuated, and                              
              possibly closed-loop controlled, micromechanism.
