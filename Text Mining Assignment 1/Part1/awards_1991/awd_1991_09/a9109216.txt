Abstract    :
              The objectives of this proposal are:  1) to develop a                          
              holographic interferometry tomography technique to obtain                      
              high-resolution refractive index data in complex three-                        
              dimensional fields,  2) apply the technique to quantify three-                 
              dimensional natural convective temperature fields in a                         
              differentially-heated cubical enclosure, and  3) evaluate the                  
              experimental results through comparison with independent                       
              temperature measurements and results of a direct numerical                     
              simulation of the three-dimensional flow in the enclosure.                     
              This research will result in the development and verification                  
              of a unique experimental system capable of obtaining three-                    
              dimensional data on length scales similar to those resolved in                 
              current computations.  This data is essential to evaluate,                     
              verify, and improve three-dimensional simulations of complex                   
              flows.  Successful application of the proposed experimental                    
              techniques is also the first step in the development of a                      
              high-resolution three-dimensional, time-dependent measurement                  
              capability.
