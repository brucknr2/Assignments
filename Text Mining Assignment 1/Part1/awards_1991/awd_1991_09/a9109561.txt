Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The main objective of this project is to collect and analyze                   
              primary data to investigate gender differences in the tenure                   
              patterns of academic economists over the last two decades.                     
              Academic success, and the underlying mechanisms through which it               
              is achieved, is significant because of the value of understanding              
              employment in a well-defined labor market which requires immense               
              investments in human capital and is dominated by long-term                     
              contracts.  Employers and employees have heterogeneous                         
              characteristics, thus both engage in search to obtain or continue              
              job-worker matchings.  Given the recent focus of critical public               
              debate on the state of the educational system and its role in                  
              future productivity gains, understanding the role of gender                    
              differences in academic labor markets is of great consequence.                 
                                                                                             
              This project documents differences in the promotion process by                 
              measuring differences in the distribution by gender across: (1)                
              fields of specialization; (2) ranks of employing and degree-                   
              granting academic institutions; and (3) publications patterns (by              
              rank of journal, type of publication, and co-authorship patterns)              
              and, second, analysis of data on mentoring, networking, and                    
              collaborating, all of which are frequently suggested to be                     
              important contributors to academic success.  New data on                       
              interrupted labor supply due to family responsibilities will be                
              collected for women.  The planning period would be used to (1)                 
              determine availability and cost of collecting data to define an                
              appropriate sample; (2) design, test, and evaluate a trial survey              
              instrument for data on interrupted labor supply; and (3) prepare               
              a NSF grant proposal.
