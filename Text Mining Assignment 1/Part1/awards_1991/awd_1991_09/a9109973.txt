Abstract    :
              A scanning tunneling microscope will be designed and constructed               
              for measuring surface displacements in the nanometer range in                  
              multiphase materials.  The results are particularly needed for                 
              improving and guiding mechanics modeling of interfacial fracture               
              in composite materials.  Initially composites of polymer matrix and            
              graphite fibers, as well as adhesive bonding of metals will be                 
              examined, and as the technique is refined the study of the                     
              deformation and fracture behavior of interfaces in ceramics and                
              metal based composites should also be possible.
