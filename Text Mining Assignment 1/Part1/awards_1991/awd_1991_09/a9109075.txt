Abstract    :
              Little is known about sex determination or the genetics of the sex             
              chromosomes of dioecious species of flowering plants. It is                    
              proposed to identify molecular markers on the large X and Y sex                
              chromosomes of Silene alba. Such markers will make it possible to              
              ask genetic questions concerning sex differentiation, evolution,               
              sex chromosome recombination, and dosage compensation in flowering             
              plants; questions which cannot now be asked.                                   
                                                                                             
              Obtaining such markers will have a significant impact in making                
              such inquiries feasible research areas for many scientists.***  //
