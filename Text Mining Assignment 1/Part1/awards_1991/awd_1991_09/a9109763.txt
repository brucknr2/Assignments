Abstract    :
              Prior work indicates that people are often biased toward omissions.            
              This proposal examines this bias.  One hypothesis is that people               
              ignore the consequences of inaction and they compare the                       
              consequences of action to the status quo.  This research also                  
              examines the conditions under which omission bias occurs, its                  
              effect on judgements about public decisions (such as global                    
              warming), its relation to other effects such as the status-quo                 
              effect, the sunk-cost effect and the extra-cost effect;                        
              individual differences in omission bias and related biases, how                
              people might be debiased, i.e., persuaded to ignore the                        
              distinctionh between acts and omissions when it is irrelevant and              
              why they sometimes resist such persuasion.  Questionaires will                 
              be given to students, museum visitors, and citizens who are                    
              particularly concerned about the issues addressed.  The results                
              could inform discussions of public policy concerning a variety of              
              issues, such as environmental risks, valuation of public                       
              goods, vaccinations and withdrawal of life-sustaining medical                  
              treatment.
