Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research is a theoretical study of the gravitational lensing              
              phenomena.  It will investigate the effects of lensing on the                  
              observed luminosity and spatial distribution of quasars and BL                 
              Lacertae objects using an elliptical model for the gravitational               
              lens.  In addition, state-of-the-art image processing techniques               
              will be combined with a new algorithm for the inversion of images              
              formed by a distribution of lensing objects to develop detailed                
              models of the lensing material.
