Abstract    :
              Elastic and inelastic helium scattering from alkali-metal                      
              overlayers on metal substrates will be used as a means of obtaining            
              additional information on their structures and dynamics, and on the            
              effects of defects on their structures and phase transitions.                  
              Results will be used to test current theory and should lead to                 
              better understanding of adsorbate/substrate                                    
              and adsorbate/adsorbate interactions.

              Adsorption phenomena are of great fundamental scientific interest,             
              but are also extremely important technologically e.g. in catalysis;            
              extraction, separation and purification; adhesion; synthesis and               
              processing.
