Abstract    :
                   Research involves the integration of computer-aided design                
              (CAD) methods and computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) for the                   
              production of radial plate and axial barrel cams.  Piecewise                   
              continuous rational polynomials will be investigated as suitable               
              functions for both design and manufacture of cams.  Traditional                
              methods as well as recently developed spline-based design                      
              strategies do not present an integrated, geometrically based system            
              for design and manufacture.                                                    
                   The objectives to be realized during the grant include:                   
              Development of an understanding of the mathematical foundations of             
              rational polynomial functions currently used in the computer aided             
              design environment; investigation of typical control systems used              
              by industrial cam manufacturers and identification of methods for              
              interfacing CAD systems with CAM controllers to achieve high order             
              motion control in the manufacturing phase; and Development of                  
              experience with the design of standard cam motion programs and                 
              contours using rational polynomial curves.
