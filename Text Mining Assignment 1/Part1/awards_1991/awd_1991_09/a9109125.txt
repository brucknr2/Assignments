Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The cytoskeleton, the framework of the cell, is responsible for                
              the shape of neurons.  The neuronal cytoskeleton is important for              
              maintaining the structure and function of mature nerve cells and               
              is involved in making functional contacts between these cells.                 
              This research project addresses events by which the process of                 
              protein phosphorylation may affect the organization and function               
              of the neuronal cytoskeleton.  Experiments utilizing a                         
              combination of in vivo and in vitro protein phosphorylation                    
              analysis techniques such as two-dimensional phosphopeptide                     
              mapping, isolation and sequencing of phosphopeptides and probes                
              of interaction between cytoskeletal proteins will be performed to              
              define the complex role of phosphorylation.  Neuronal                          
              cytoskeletal proteins, fodrin and a newly recognized protein,                  
              HPN-350, characterized by an high number of phosphorylated                     
              groups, will be examined during subunit polymerization, axonal                 
              entry, and incorporation into the axonal cytoskeleton.  Results                
              of this study will provide additional information on neuronal                  
              cytoskeleton dynamics, pertinent to basic neurobiological issues               
              of developmental growth and neuronal plasticity.
