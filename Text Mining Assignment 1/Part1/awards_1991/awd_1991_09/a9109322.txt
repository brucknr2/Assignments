Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project focuses on utilization of                                         
              results of the U.S. Coordinated Program for                                    
              Masonry Building Research (TCCMAR).  This                                      
              final phase of the Coordinated Program,                                        
              originally comprised of twenty-eight                                           
              compatible and coordinated research tasks                                      
              both experimental and analytical, is designed                                  
              to produce:  a consistent technological base                                   
              for reinforced masonry, analytical methods                                     
              capable of treating nonlinear behavior, and                                    
              support limit states design and criteria                                       
              methodology.  The project will address three                                   
              primary objectives in order to achieve the                                     
              final TCCMAR program goal.
