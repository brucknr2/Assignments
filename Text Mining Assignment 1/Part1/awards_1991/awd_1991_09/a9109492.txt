Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              There is an extensive statistics and econometrics literature on                
              statistical tests for structural changes at an unknown time.  The              
              research on these tests reflect their important role in getting                
              accurate, unbiased estimates of economic relationships from time               
              series data.  The contribution of this project comes from                      
              providing a better understanding of the properties of existing                 
              tests for structural change and from developing new tests with                 
              better properties.  These tests are then used to improve                       
              empirical studies in macroeconomics and financial economics.                   
                                                                                             
              This project analyzes the behavior of tests for structural change              
              in a time series context that ultimately allows for series having              
              a general correlation structure and possible nonstationarity,                  
              either of the form of a polynomial time trend or of a stochastic               
              nature induced by the presence of a unit root.  The components of              
              the investigation consist of the following: 1)  Analysis of the                
              finite sample properties of current available tests for                        
              structural change which allow for the presence of serial                       
              correlation, e.g., CUSUM, Chow test, LR test, and others; 2)                   
              Explanation of the finite sample behavior using non-standard                   
              asymptotic distribution theory, e.g., continuous-time asymptotic               
              and small-sigma asymptotic; 3) Development of alternative                      
              statistical procedures that have better finite sample properties;              
              4)  Extensions of currently available procedures to the case                   
              where the time series is characterized by either a deterministic               
              or stochastic trend; 5) Derivation of the asymptotic                           
              distributions and the analysis of the finite sample properties                 
              for tests for structural change with trending; 6)  Empirical                   
              application to issues related to macroeconomic variables with                  
              special emphasis on testing for a change in the trend function of              
              a univariate time series.
