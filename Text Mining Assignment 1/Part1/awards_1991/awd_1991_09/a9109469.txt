Abstract    :
              Current software development environments tend to lie at opposite ends         
              of a spectrum:  at one extreme are specialized application generators;         
              at the other are general purpose programming environments.  The former         
              provide strong support for system development and reuse, but are               
              costly to build and available only for limited domains.  The latter            
              provide weak support, but are generally available and universally              
              applicable.  This research explores a way to automate the production           
              of application-specific environments that lie between these two                
              extremes.                                                                      
              The key idea is that a software framework encapsulating the                    
              commonalities in a family of systems can be incorporated into an               
              existing general purpose programming environment by a process of               
              structured transformation.  Specifically, this project is to develop a         
              system that allows an environment implementor to specialize existing           
              programming environments to handle families of applications.  The              
              system provides a set of formal operators for augmenting a formal              
              description of an environment; as operators are applied, the system            
              semi-automatically builds a set of transformation rules that can be            
              used to translate application-specific programs into those of the              
              original environment.  The output of the system is an application-             
              specific environment together with a program transformer that provides         
              execution semantics for programs written in that environment.
