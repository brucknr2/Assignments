Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              American public policy is remarkably stable and resistent to                   
              change.  Yet over the past forty years, dramatic changes have                  
              occurred in American public policies toward women in particular.               
              This sophisticated empirical study develops and tests a political              
              process theory to account for the political success of the women's             
              movement in the United States.                                                 
                                                                                             
              Specifically, this study uses longitudinal data on women's movement            
              activities, public opinion toward women's issues, and congressional            
              activity to assess the nature and extent of the effect which the               
              women's movement has had on American public policy.  In addition               
              to explaining how the women's movement has shaped the development              
              of public policy, the study should contribute to our understanding             
              of social movements more generally and how they influence the                  
              policy process.
