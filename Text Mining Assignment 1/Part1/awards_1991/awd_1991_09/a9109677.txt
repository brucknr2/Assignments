Abstract    :
              With support from the Organic Dynamics Program, Dr. Jennings                   
              will attempt to provide a mechanistic rationale to account for                 
              the observed course of a highly stereo- and regioselective                     
              platinum-mediated organic transformation and to further explore                
              its potential utility in organic synthesis. In addition, Dr.                   
              Jennings plans to develop new catalytic transformations of                     
              olefinic substrates which will proceed with high degrees of                    
              regio- and stereoselectivity to afford useful products.                        
              %%%                                                                            
              Metal-facilitated organic transformations have evolved into a                  
              significant subdiscipline of organic/organometallic chemistry.                 
              Dr. Jennings will utilize organoplatinum compounds in a unique                 
              manner that is expected to render them useful as catalysts that                
              are capable of promoting synthetically useful cyclopropane                     
              transformations. In addition to adding significantly to our                    
              mechanistic understanding of metal-facilitated organic                         
              transformations, Dr. Jennings' studies are expected to lead to                 
              new methodology that can be used to synthesize interesting                     
              natural products.
