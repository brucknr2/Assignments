Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The role of innvervation in slow and fast muscle-motor unit                    
              formation will be studied in the chick embryo.  Changes in NCAM                
              and N-cadherin, cell surfaces molecules, in the process during                 
              which secondary myotubes partition off from primary myotube                    
              clusters will be investigated.  The functional role of these cell              
              surface molecules will be studied in ovo in the chick and in cell              
              culture using blocking antibodies or enzymatic degradation.                    
              Finally, the roles of myotube cluster formation, synapse                       
              formation and functional innervation will be investigated in a                 
              series of transplantation studies in which small pieces of quail               
              neural tube are transplanted into chick.   These studies are                   
              unique in their approach in that they correlate molecular changes              
              and cell-cell relationships with onset of neural function.
