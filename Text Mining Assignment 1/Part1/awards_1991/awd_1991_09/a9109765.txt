Abstract    :
                   In this project the principal investigator will analyze models            
              of nematic liquid crystals with variable degrees of orientation as             
              a means of studying highly nonlinear material behavior such as the             
              formation of structured domains and patterns.  The approach will               
              consist of an analytical part and an experimental part.  On the                
              analytical side the principal investigator will employ mathematical            
              methods to describe the formation and evolution of banding                     
              structures, singularity lines and disclinations in the solutions of            
              the system of parabolic partial differential equations that governs            
              the behavior of the materials.  On the experimental side the                   
              principal investigator and a graduate student will conduct actual              
              experiments in the Fluid Dynamics Laboratory in the Mathematics                
              Department at Penn State in order to discover some qualitative                 
              features of the coarsening processes of domain structures and the              
              nature of the interaction between singularity lines.                           
                   The project to be carried out by the principal investigator               
              and a graduate student is an exciting interplay between analytical             
              applied mathematics and experimental fluid dynamics.  For the past             
              few years the principal investigator has studied the systems of                
              differential equations that govern the behavior of liquid crystals             
              using mathematical tools.  She plans now to combine this analytical            
              work with experimental studies of the phenomena modelled by the                
              equations.  The research will have relevance to improving the                  
              industrial processing of anisotropic polymeric materials.
