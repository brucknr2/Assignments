Abstract    :
              Failure mechanisms of rubber composites are extremely complex and              
              three dimensional in nature.  This project focuses on the                      
              development of a 3-D finite element model which includes                       
              geometrical and material nonlinearities, anisotropic, and bimodular            
              material behavior for characterizing the interface/interlaminar                
              failures in rubber composites.  Formulations for 3-D tearing energy            
              computations, failure criterion for characterizing different                   
              interface failures and prediction of crack propagation path will               
              be developed.  Emphasis will be placed on the simplicity of the                
              model and accuracy, and the use of computer graphics to represent              
              the interface failure mechanisms for better understanding of rubber            
              composite structures.  The finite element results obtained will be             
              validated using benchmark problems and available experimental data.
