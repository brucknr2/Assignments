Abstract    :
              Remote Plasma Assisted Materials Processing                                    
              (RPAMP) is a method whereby etchings and                                       
              depositions may be performed with the substrate                                
              located out of the plasma zone.  This enables                                  
              processing to be performed without significant                                 
              damage by ion bombardment and with highly                                      
              selective chemical reaction pathways.  Selectivity in                          
              RPAMP results from the ability to initiate a selected                          
              subset of reactions compared to conventional plasma                            
              processing.  In this project we propose to continue                            
              studies of the electron kinetics and chemistry of                              
              processing plasmas with emphasis on electron                                   
              transport and selective chemistries in remote plasma                           
              devices.  A new algorithm called Combination                                   
              Kinetics is introduced for simultaneously obtaining                            
              electron energy distributions and excited state                                
              densities in multiple dimensions.
