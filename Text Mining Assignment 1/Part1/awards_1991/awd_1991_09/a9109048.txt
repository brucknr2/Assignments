Abstract    :
                   There have been many recent results in the p-adic theory of               
              modular forms, with emphasis on p-adic periods and p-adic analogues            
              of the conjecture of Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer.  The workshop                  
              supported by this grant will high-light the L-invariant, which                 
              appears as a factor of the leading Taylor coefficient of the p-adic            
              L-function of a 'split multiplicative' newform.  At least five                 
              independent interpretations of this invariant have been proposed in            
              recent years.  By bringing researchers together to discuss the                 
              underlying ideas, the workshop will contribute to a deeper                     
              understanding of the interdependence between p-adic Hodge theory,              
              analogues of the conjecture of Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer, p-adic               
              uniformization theory, p-adic differential equations, and                      
              deformations of Galois representations.                                        
                   The workshop will be held at Boston University in August,                 
              1991, and will bring together the leading researchers in this area             
              from the United States and abroad.  It will have a profound effect             
              on the graduate students and recent Ph.D.s who attend.  The results            
              of the workshop will be published in a conference proceedings.
