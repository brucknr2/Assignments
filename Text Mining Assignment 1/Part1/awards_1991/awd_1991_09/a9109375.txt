Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Appropriate development and maintenance of the connections                     
              and metabolism of neurons are necessary requisites to all                      
              functions of the nervous system, including the processes of                    
              learning and memory and other cognitive abilities.  Knowledge of               
              the substances that regulate these processes in mature neurons                 
              and during development is limited.  However, two classes that                  
              have been implicated in the development, survival, and                         
              regeneration of neurons in cerebral cortex, the brain region                   
              involved cognitive functions, are the steroid hormone, estradiol,              
              and the locally-synthesized growth- and survival-promoting                     
              protein, nerve growth factor (NGF).  Indeed, Dr. Toran-Allerand                
              has demonstrated that neurons of cerebral cortex contain                       
              receptors for both estrogen and NGF.  She will now investigate in              
              parallel the developmental history of the co-expressed estrogen                
              and NGF receptor systems in vivo and analyze the cellular and                  
              molecular consequences of estrogen/NGF interactions in vitro.                  
              The results of this work will provide insights into those factors              
              that may be of importance to the development of brain regions                  
              which underlie cognitive functions.  Moreover, the basic                       
              information gained from this work may ultimately provide a                     
              biological rationale for clinical investigations into possible                 
              therapeutic approaches involving both estrogen and NGF in                      
              Alzheimer's disease and related disorders of cognition.
