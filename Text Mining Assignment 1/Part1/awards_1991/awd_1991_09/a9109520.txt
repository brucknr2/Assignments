Abstract    :
              In recent years, the need for developing techniques and                        
              methodologies for the design, representation and manipulation of               
              transactions or behaviors has become clear.  This research                     
              focuses on the study and development of theoretical foundations                
              for object-based database manipulation languages.  Several                     
              fundamental problems concerning dynamic constraints and update                 
              transactions in the context of semantic and object-based models                
              are investigated.  One aspect is the formal analysis of object                 
              behaviors under a behavior modeling construct used to compose                  
              andstructure transactions in projects TAXIS, INSYDE, DAIDA, etc.               
              The initial study is based on a simple object-oriented data model              
              including class hierarchies, attributes ranging over printable                 
              values, and methods.  Another topic is the study of behavior                   
              modeling primitives as new kinds of dynamic constraint and also                
              compare them with other kinds of dynamic constraint.  More                     
              general database models (e.g., to allow attributes ranging over                
              classes) are also considered.  The investigations into these                   
              problems yield a better understanding of these modeling                        
              constructs and insights into the impact of Object Identifiers on               
              database manipulation languages.
