Abstract    :
                   The objective of the proposed work is to acquire the data                 
              needed to determine field sites for tests of a conceptual model                
              that describes the geomorphic processes active on a floodplain                 
              during inundation.  To determine the study reaches for field                   
              reaches for field investigations, from June 10 December 1991, the              
              literature on hydrologic, sediment transport, geologic, geomorphic,            
              and vegetative characteristics of domestic and foreign alluvial                
              rivers will be compiled.  Data regarding the hydrologic and                    
              sediment transport characteristics of rivers during overbank                   
              flooding and the relation between floodplain topography and the                
              depths of inundating flows will be especially sought.
