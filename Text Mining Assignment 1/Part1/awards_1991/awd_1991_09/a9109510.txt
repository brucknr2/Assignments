Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Axonal elongation and directional growth are affected by both                  
              stimulatory and inhibitory factors.  Previous work has shown that              
              axonal contact with inhibitory factors results in collapse of the              
              growth cone.  To further study mechanisms involved in the action               
              of inhibitory factors, an in vitro bioassay consisting of                      
              gradients of inhibitory activity contained in agarose gel will be              
              established and characterized.  This bioassay will be used with                
              chick dorsal root ganglion neurons to determine whether                        
              inhibitory factors that cause growth cone collapse also have                   
              effects on directional growth of axons.  In addition, the effects              
              of growth cone collapse on specific components of the                          
              cytoskeleton labeled with antibodies will be studied using time-               
              lapse video microscopy and transmission electron microscopy.                   
              These studies are fundamental to identifying molecules involved                
              in axonal guidance.
