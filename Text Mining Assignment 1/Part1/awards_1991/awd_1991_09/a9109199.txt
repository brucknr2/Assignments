Abstract    :
                   Professor Jochnowitz proposes to investigate p-adic                       
              properties of modular forms of half integral weight and the                    
              Shimura correspondence between forms of half integral weight and               
              integral weight.  She hopes to apply the results of these                      
              investigations to elliptic curves and class numbers of quadratic               
              fields.                                                                        
                   This project falls into the general area of arithmetic                    
              geometry -a subject that blends two of the oldest areas of                     
              mathematics: number theory and geometry.  This combination has                 
              proved extraordinarily fruitful - having recently solved problems              
              that withstood generations.  Among its many consequences are new               
              error correcting codes.  Such codes are essential for both modern              
              computers (hard disks) and compact disks.
