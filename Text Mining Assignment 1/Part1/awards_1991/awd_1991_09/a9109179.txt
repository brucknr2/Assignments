Abstract    :
              Many pesticides are chiral--that is, their chemical structures                 
              exist as a pair of "hand" enantiomers.  Generally, only one of                 
              the pair of enantiomers exhibits the desired biological activity.              
              Despite mounting evidence that critical pesticides should be                   
              developed and marketed as single enantiomers, more than 90% of                 
              the synthetic chiral pesticides are marketed as racemic mixtures,              
              which contain both enantiomers.  The principal reason is because               
              of the high cost and technical difficulty of preparing the                     
              enantiomerically pure chiral intermediates needed to prepare the               
              chiral pesticide.                                                              
                                                                                             
              The goal of this program is to develop a simple, cost-                         
              effective process to prepare enantiomerically pure (s)-m-                      
              phenoxybenzaldehyde cyanohydrin, an important chiral intermediate              
              used in the synthesis of pyrethroid insecticides--a commercially               
              important class of highly effective insecticides.  In Phase I, we              
              demonstrated the technical and economic feasibility of our                     
              approach, which is based on dual-membranes enzyme-reactor                      
              process.  In this Phase II program, we plan to characterize and                
              optimize the process and, through construction and operation of a              
              bench-scale unit, generate the data necessary to commercialize                 
              the process with our probable Phase III sponsor, a major                       
              manufacturer of m-phenoxybenzaldehyde cyanohydrin.
