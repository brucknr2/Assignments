Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a Career Advancement Award for a young woman theorist, an              
              expert on the interface of particle physics and cosmology.  She                
              will study models for the origin of large scale structure in the               
              universe, and compare them with the observed statistics of galaxy              
              clustering.  She will also attempt to put constraints on some of               
              the characteristics if the phrase transitions believed to have                 
              occurred in the early universe by studying the properties of the               
              neutron star equation of state as suggested by observations of                 
              rapid pulsars.
