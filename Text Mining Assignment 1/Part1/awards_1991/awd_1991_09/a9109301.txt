Abstract    :
              Professor John Ross is supported by a grant from the                           
              Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to perform                     
              experimental and theoretical studies on irreversible processes                 
              which are characteristic of nonlinear systems. Ross will pursue                
              both theoretical and experimental research in the general area                 
              of nonlinear chemical systems.  Research will be performed in                  
              four major areas: 1) Thermodynamic and stochastic analyses of                  
              irreversible processes; 2) Chemical structures and chemical                    
              waves on membranes; 3) Theoretical and experimental formulation                
              of chemical computing elements (a chemical Turing machine); and                
              4) Use of delay measurements in the classification of                          
              oscillatory chemical reactions.

              This research will provide important physical and chemical                     
              insights regarding oscillating chemical reactions, chemical                    
              waves on membrance, and irreversible transport processes such                  
              as mass diffusion, thermal conduction and viscous flow.
