Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This planning grant is intended to assist in preparing a                       
              major research proposal for future submitting to NSF.  The                     
              planning activity comprises (1) a literature search, (2)                       
              investigation of the robustness properties of linear                           
              quadratic regulator (LQR) systems, (3) preliminary analysis                    
              of LQR control laws, (4) identification of nonlinear system                    
              stability, (5) documentation of preliminary results, and                       
              (6) development of a research proposal.
