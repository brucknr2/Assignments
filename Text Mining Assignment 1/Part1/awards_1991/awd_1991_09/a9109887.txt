Abstract    :
              This is a Research Initiation Award dealing with                               
              implementation of a power system dynamic security                              
              index.  The index is the mean first passage time                               
              (MFPT) required for a system to reach dynamic                                  
              security limits when affected by a contingency.  The                           
              project will include a study of the relationship between                       
              MFPT and the contingency selection problem.
