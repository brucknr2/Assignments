Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The human visual system uses a variety of cues to do the                  
              common but often not easy task of identifying groups of visual                 
              targets into perceptual categories.  Visual attributes include                 
              such features as color, orientation, luminance, spatial                        
              frequency, and so on.  Two widely studied properties of visual                 
              targets are texture and motion.                                                
                   This project will investigate some of the interactions                    
              between features of texture and motion perception, how those                   
              interactions may be important for perceptual grouping, and how                 
              the resulting data may improve existing neurophysiologically                   
              plausible computational models for texture segregation.  A novel               
              class of stimuli with multiple attributes has been developed for               
              these tests.  Data from the proposed experiments are likely to                 
              have an impact not only on visual neuroscience, but on image                   
              processing, machine vision and pattern recognition, and                        
              scientific visualization.
