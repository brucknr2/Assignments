Abstract    :
                 This is a Career Advancement Award to support Dr. Benyajati's               
              attempts to establish primary cell cultures of reptilian renal                 
              epithelium.  Successful establishment of such a cell culture system            
              would be a major step forward in the study of reptilian kidney                 
              physiology.  Dr. Benyajati's longer-term goal is to use these                  
              cultures to study the regulation of taurine uptake and secretion               
              in snake kidney.                                                               
                                                                                             
              If successful, the establishment of snake kidney cell cultures are             
              anticipated to significantly enhance Dr. Benyajati's career.
