Abstract    :
              The weighted graph mapping problem is motivated by the problem of              
              assigning program modules to processors in parallel architectures.             
              The formulation of the weighted graph mapping problem has not only led         
              to a novel approach to assigning modules, but has also suggested new           
              and challenging graph-theoretic problems.                                      
              The main objectives of this Research Planning Grant proposal are to            
              develop a good understanding of the proposed research problems, to             
              establish a competitive research project, and to prepare a grant               
              proposal to NSF.//
