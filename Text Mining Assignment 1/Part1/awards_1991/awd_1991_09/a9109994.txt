Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              In response to discussions with the Assistant to the President                 
              for Science and Technology, a request from the Environmental                   
              Protection Agency (EPA), interest in both Houses of Congress, and              
              interest in the research community, the Commission on Life                     
              Sciences (CLS) proposes to organize and lead a multi-commission                
              National Research Council (NRC) assessment of the status of                    
              environmental research in the United States, including current                 
              research activities, needs, funding and trends.  The study would               
              examine ways to improve federal programs and funding for                       
              environmental research and training, including various proposals               
              to establish National Institutes for the Environment and other                 
              ways to improve the science base in environmental protection and               
              resource management.  Total estimated costs for this 15-month                  
              study are $650,000, of which the National Science Foundation is                
              asked to contribute $50,000.  Remaining funds are being requested              
              from the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of the                
              Interior, the Department of Energy, the Department of Defense,                 
              and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.  An                   
              award for this important planning study is recommended.
