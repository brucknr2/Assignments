Abstract    :
                   In molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations, the                    
              energy of a many-body system must be computed repeatedly for                   
              millions of configurations.  It is therefore essential to use                  
              theories and algorithms that allow for fast calculations.  In                  
              quantum chemistry, the extended Huckel method is one of the most               
              economic theoretical approaches for calculating energies.                      
              Although simple, this method gives sufficiently accurate results               
              in appropriately selected applications.  A combination of                      
              molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations with the extended               
              Huckel method should therefore be useful in studying dynamic                   
              phenomena near surfaces and in the solid state.  The proposed                  
              research will study the reconstruction of the Si(111) ( 3 x  3)                
              R30 -B surface structure using the extended Huckel method and                  
              Monte Carlo simulation.                                                        
                   Density functional theory is ideal for extended systems and               
              large molecules.  Although computationally intensive, it tends to              
              give excellent results especially for free-electron systems.                   
              Central in this theory is that the ground state energy is a                    
              unique functional of the electron density.  There is no need for               
              any iteration in density functional calculations.  The second                  
              focus of the research will be to continue explorations of the                  
              combination of density functional theory and computer simulation               
              to study dynamic processes in condensed phase systems.
