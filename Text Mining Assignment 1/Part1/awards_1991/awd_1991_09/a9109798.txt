Abstract    :
              Economies of scale achieved through mass production of a limited               
              number of products has been the cornerstone of successful                      
              manufacturing throughout this century.  For most industries, this              
              strategy is rapidly becoming obsolete as the competitive emphasis              
              shifts to producing an enormous variety of products at costs                   
              approaching the efficiency of mass production.  This trend to                  
              variety competition is driven by many factors.  This proposal                  
              describes a program of research to develop models and algorithms               
              for designing the products in a product line and for designing and             
              managing the production process in an environment of high product              
              variety.  The first component of our research is concerned with                
              developing detailed sequencing models and algorithms appropriate               
              for managing the mixed-model transfer lines that will soon become              
              the dominant production process for automobiles.  The second                   
              component is developing strategic planning models and algorithms               
              that integrate product planning, technology choice and design of               
              production lines.
