Abstract    :
              A unique experimental apparatus will be constructed, capable of                
              preparing, by vapor deposition, thin-film alloys from 4K up to                 
              1100K and permitting measurement of thermodynamic and transport                
              properties of these samples in situ from 1k to 1100K.                          
                                                                                             
                                          %%%                                                
                                                                                             
              Many of the more interesting magnetic-alloy materials are both                 
              highly reactive in air and, too, only available in thin-film form.             
              With the proposed apparatus, it will become possible to measure                
              thermal properties of such materials and furnish a test of current             
              theory.
