Abstract    :
                   This project is concerned with the study of a unique basis                
              for the complex valued class functions defined on the Carter                   
              classes of a finite solvable group that behave the same way as                 
              the irreducible Brauer characters do in a p-solvable group.  The               
              principal investigator will address a similar question for System              
              Normalizers.                                                                   
                   This research is in the general area of the representation                
              theory of finite groups.  One of the main applications of group                
              representation theory.
