Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A series of projects involving novel and topical materials                     
              including the new high temperature superconductors, heavy Fermion              
              materials (including the exotic heavy fermion superconductors),                
              and the transition metals and their compounds is proposed.                     
              Specifically, a new speculative model proposed to explain the                  
              anomalous superconductivity which occurs in the high temperature               
              superconductors and some heavy fermion materials and the effect                
              of magnetic/kondo impurities on disorder-induced weak                          
              localization will be parameterized, tested, and used to calculate              
              the phase diagrams of transition metals from first principles.                 
              The basic problem is to accurately calculate various physical                  
              properties of these materials.  However, the electronic                        
              correlations in these materials make this difficult.  To overcome              
              these problems novel combinations of established techniques like               
              quantum Monte Carlo, the local density approximation, and self-                
              consistent perturbation theories, as well as generating new                    
              techniques will be used.  These techniques are computationally                 
              intense, and implementation is only now possible due to recent                 
              advances in computer technology.
