Abstract    :
                   Selective lesions limited to neuroanatomically discrete                   
              areas within the hippocampal formation and sensitive behavioral                
              testing procedures, will be used by Dr. Leonard Jarrard to study               
              the involvement of these different areas in learning and memory.               
              His previous research demonstrated the feasibility of selectively              
              lesioning these areas with neurotoxins and his behavioral                      
              research has indicated important functional differences.  The                  
              proposed research centers around the following areas: 1) the                   
              utilization of spatial and intramaze cue information, 2) object                
              recognition memory, and 3) the role of hippocampal formation                   
              structures in elementary learning processes.  The proposed                     
              experiments will add to our understanding of structure-function                
              relations within the hippocampal formation, will help clarify the              
              rather confusing literature on the effects of hippocampal lesions              
              on learning and memory, and will provide information relevant to               
              recent theorizing and modeling in the learning and memory field.
