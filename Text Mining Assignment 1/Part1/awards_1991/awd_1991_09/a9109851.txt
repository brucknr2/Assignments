Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A crucial step in the sense of smell is that where odorous                     
              compounds first bind to the ciliary membranes of the receptor                  
              cells in the nose.  Biochemical research has revealed many of the              
              steps in this transduction, by which the binding of a molecule is              
              converted into a nerve signal carried to the brain.  However it                
              is not yet clear exactly where and how the important binding                   
              proteins are localized in the membrane, nor when during                        
              development these proteins become incorporated to function                     
              properly.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              This project uses a variety of biochemical tagging techniques                  
              along with electron microscopy to reveal where and when during                 
              development several important classes of olfactory transduction                
              proteins are expressed in the ciliary membranes.  These results                
              will be correlated with the developmental timing of known                      
              electrophysiological and other cellular changes, to test                       
              predictions about the relation of membrane structures to                       
              function.  The findings will have an impact on chemosensory                    
              research, and on general neuroscience because of the similarity                
              of olfactory binding processes to cell-cell communication.
