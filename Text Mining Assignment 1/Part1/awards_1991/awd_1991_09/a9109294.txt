Abstract    :
              This award provides funds to aid in the equipment of a common                  
              equipment facility for in the Department of Biochemical and                    
              Biophysical Sciences at the University of Houston.  Research                   
              programs of the faculty include a variety of topics in                         
              biochemistry and in cell and molecular biology.  The equipment to              
              be acquired include items needed for growth and isolation of                   
              cells, for analysis and preparation of highly purified proteins,               
              and for long-term storage of cells and proteins.  Each of the                  
              items to be purchased will benefit the research programs of most               
              of the participating faculty.
