Abstract    :
              The goal of the proposed research is the elucidation of the                    
              mechanism of the enzyme pyruvate phosphate dikinase at the                     
              molecular level.  This is to be achieved through the x-ray                     
              crystallographic determination of the structures of the native                 
              enzyme, of mutant enzymes and of enzyme-inhibitor complexes.
