Abstract    :
              Farvardin         The basic idea of this research is to develop a class of 
              suboptimal vector quantizers in which the codebook is derived, in  a simple
              manner, from another highly structured codebook,  therefore, eliminating the
              need to store the codebook and hence  allowing the design of very large
              codebooks. For memoryless  sources, the codebook of the Structured Vector
              Quantization (SVQ)  is selected as a well-defined subset of the Cartesian
              product of  the codebook of a specific entropy-coded scalar quantizer.  Since 
              the SVQ codebook is a part of a highly structured codebook, the  memory
              requirements, the complexity, and the needed training data  are reduced
              significantly, hence, allowing the possibility of  designing SVQs with large
              codebooks.         The research plan entails the design, analysis and 
              simulation of SVQs, along with a meaningful comparison of their  merits with
              respect to other known quantization schemes.  Based  on the results of this
              research, the application and performance  of SVQs in more practical situations
              representative of real-world  problems will be studied.
