Abstract    :
                   This project is concerned with two problems in the theory of              
              modular forms.  The principal investigator will study bounding the             
              norm of the Poincare theta operator.  She will also study modular              
              integrals with rational period functions using a cohomological                 
              approach.                                                                      
                   Modular forms arose out of non-Euclidean geometry in the                  
              middle of the nineteenth century.  Both mathematicians and                     
              physicists have thus long realized that many objects of fundamental            
              importance are non- Euclidean in their basic nature.  This field is            
              principally concerned with questions about the whole numbers.                  
              However, in its use of geometry and analysis, it retains connection            
              to its historical roots and thus to problems in areas as diverse as            
              gauge theory in theoretical physics and coding theory in                       
              information theory.
