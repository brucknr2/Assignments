Abstract    :
                   This project continues studies in near-integrable systems                 
              along two main lines: physical applications, and the development               
              of solution methods based on the algebraic structure of the                    
              equations.  Applications focus on problems related to nonlinear                
              optics.  Along the second line attention is concentrated on                    
              solving the initial value problem for dispersionless Lax                       
              equations, such as the dispersionless KP equation.                             
                   Integrable systems of partial differential equations often                
              have solutions whose properties can be exactly established.  This              
              is quite unlike the usual case for nonlinear partial differential              
              equations.  What is important here is that often the properties                
              remain when the system is perturbed.  Thus one can tell a great                
              deal about otherwise intractable problems.  Such problems arise                
              in nonlinear optics (for example, in the design of long-distance               
              communication networks using fiber optics), in the motion of                   
              waves in nonlinear acoustic media, and in flows around thin                    
              wings.
