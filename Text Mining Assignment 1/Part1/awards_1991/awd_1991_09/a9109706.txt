Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Neural plasticity is an important process of change that occurs                
              in the central nervous system.  An interdisciplinary meeting,                  
              under the auspices of the Gordon Research Conferences, has been                
              planned to assemble neuroscience investigators who share a common              
              interest in neural plasticity.  The central theme of this                      
              conference will be the modification of the structure, chemistry                
              and function of the nervous system.  Emphasis will be placed upon              
              the need to examine plasticity at different levels, including the              
              molecular, cellular and systems levels.  In addition, the                      
              integration of computational approaches in studying neural                     
              plasticity will be discussed.  This meeting will provide                       
              investigators with the opportunity to share ideas and                          
              experimental techniques in this area of study.
