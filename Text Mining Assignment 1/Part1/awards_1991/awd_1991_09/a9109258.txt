Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The proposed planning activities will investigate fundamental                  
              questions concerning the energetic strategies utilized during                  
              early development of bathyal crabs.  Specific questions to be                  
              addressed include: 1). what are the contributions of different                 
              lipid classes, protein, and carbohydrate toward nutritional                    
              requirements during embryonic development of the deep-sea red                  
              crab Chaceon quinquedens; and 2). what are the contributions of                
              maternal nutritional history and depth (or temperature) of                     
              occurrence to the patterns of yolk utilization in red crab                     
              embryos.  My preliminary work demonstrates that this species                   
              exhibits two different patterns of yolk composition and                        
              utilization during embryogenesis.  This proposed planning                      
              activities are designed to determine the factors responsible                   
              for the observed variation and will be used as the basis for a                 
              more detailed comparative study on embryonic nutritional                       
              flexibility in two species of bathyal crabs, red crab and                      
              golden crab C. fenneri, which have different geographic and                    
              bathymetric distributions.
