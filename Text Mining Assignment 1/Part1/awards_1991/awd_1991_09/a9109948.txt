Abstract    :
              In response to chemical gradients, bacteria are able to                        
              direct their motion toward conditions favorable to their                       
              survival.  The objectives of this project are: to                              
              quantitatively characterize this phenomenon, known as                          
              bacterial chemotaxis, within natural systems; to develop                       
              predictive capabilities through mathematical modeling; and                     
              to exploit chemotactic behavior technologically.  By                           
              manipulating their chemotactic response through genetic                        
              engineering or adaptation, the migration of bacterial                          
              populations toward contaminated zones can be enhanced.
