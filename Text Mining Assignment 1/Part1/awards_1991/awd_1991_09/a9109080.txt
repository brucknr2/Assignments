Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This request is for the purchase of a SQUID magnetometer capable of            
              providing standard magnetic measurements over a wide range of                  
              temperature, from 2 to 800 Kelvins.  The SQUID magnetometer is                 
              needed in fundamental studies of problems in materials science and             
              engineering, solid state chemistry, and condensed matter physics.              
              Studies which will make use of the magnetometer include:                       
              investigations of the critical cross-over energies and redox                   
              energies in mixed-metal oxides; magnetic interaction in covalent               
              systems such as chalcogenides and pnictides, crystal chemistry and             
              properties of metal oxides; permanent magnet alloys, and solid                 
              freeform fabrication; powder and gas-phase laser processing and                
              nanometer powder processing.  An available magnetometer will allow             
              the training of graduate and undergraduate students in a technique             
              important for materials synthesis, characterization, and                       
              processing.  This magnetometer will be housed in the Center for                
              Materials Science and Engineering, used primarily by six faculty               
              members and four other members of the center.  Maintenance and                 
              operation will be provided by the PI and CO-PI through their                   
              current and pending NSF support.  The instrument willl be shared by            
              the PI/CO-PI (70% use) with three other groups (30% use).  About 22            
              grad students, 7 post-docs, and 4 undergraduate students will have             
              access to this instrument.
