Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The goal of Dr. Clemens' research is to understand connections                 
              between the brain and the spinal cord of nerve cells that are                  
              involved in the control of reproductive behavior. Specific tracer              
              substances will be used to define such pathways at both the light              
              and electron microscopic levels. The neurochemical characteristics             
              of the pathways and the effects of hormonal manipulations on the               
              nerve cells will also be studied. Knowledge about this neural                  
              system under normal conditions is a prerequisite to understanding              
              changes that can occur when the system is dysfunctional such as may            
              happen with aging. This research will contribute to basic                      
              understanding of the role of the nervous system in reproductive                
              function.
