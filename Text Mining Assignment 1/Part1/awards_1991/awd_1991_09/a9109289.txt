Abstract    :
              Although powerful tools for numerical, statistical, and symbolic               
              computation are readily available, there has not emerged a                     
              comprehensive and widely used environment for combinatorial computing          
              of comparable influence.  The goal of this project is to meet this             
              need.                                                                          
                                                                                             
              The system Combinatorica was developed as a combinatorial computing            
              environment, comprising over 230 functions for manipulating graphs and         
              other combinatorial objects such as permutations, partitions, and              
              Young tableaux.  Combinatorica has already been applied to research in         
              algorithms, biology, graph theory, number theory and engineering, as           
              well as education.  However, it is but a prototype for the ultimate            
              combinatorial computing environment.                                           
                                                                                             
              Three significant research issures will be addressed which are                 
              fundamental to the development of future combinatorial computing               
              environments.  First, a method will be investigated to effectively             
              compute NP-complete graph invariants through graph recognition and             
              inversion, by identifying special classes graphs for which there exist         
              efficient algorithms.  Second, efficient combinatorial search                  
              techniques will be developed for sub-graph isomorphism, graph minors,          
              and graph homeomorphism - fundamental primitives which have not been           
              implemented in full generality in any existing combinatorial computing         
              environment.  Finally, graph algorithms will be developed for                  
              applicative or write-once machines, which experience shows to be a             
              more accurate computational model for term-rewriting systems than              
              random access machines.                                                        
                                                                                             
              These algorithms will form the heart of the proposed next version of           
              Combinatorica to be written in C++ and X-windows and comprising both a         
              workbench and library for combinatorial computing.
