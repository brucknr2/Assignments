Abstract    :
              This research will plan, build and evaluate a computer-supported               
              cooperative problem solving environment that teaches people how                
              to solve problems by working together.  The environment is based               
              on a communication competency model that assumes that a group's                
              effectiveness depends upon the performance of communication                    
              competencies (or skills) that aid groups in solving problems.                  
              The model provides a preliminary categorization of the various                 
              communicative competencies that, in turn, can be represented in a              
              computer-supported cooperative work environment through online                 
              tools designed to support related communication functions.                     
              Several precursors of this system have been developed by the                   
              principal investigator and were designed to teach effective                    
              problem solving skills, assess mission success, and support                    
              computer-supported cooperative problem solving for an information              
              retrieval task.  This work extends that research by developing a               
              special computer-supported interface that can be used to                       
              investigate how to teach people to use communication competencies              
              in order to solve problems more effectively.
