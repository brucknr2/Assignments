Abstract    :
              The objective of this research is to investigate the stress-                   
              strain-strength behavior of relatively weak cohesive                           
              foundation soils during stage construction of embankments.                     
              Anisotropically consolidated direct simple shear tests will                    
              be performed on soil samples under stress conditions                           
              representative of those acting during stage construction.                      
              Different soil types reflecting plasticity and mineralogy,                     
              overconsolidation ratio and consolidation stress ratio will                    
              be investigated. Using experimental results and field                          
              verification, final recommendations will be made for improved                  
              design of staged constructed embankments.
