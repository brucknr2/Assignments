Abstract    :
              This investigation will convene an interdisciplinary working group             
              of experts to analyze international regimes for managing regional              
              environmental resources.  The group would focus on the comparative             
              study of three cases:  the Great Lakes, the Baltic, and the                    
              Mediterranean.  The project would consider 1)  the role of                     
              scientific and other "epistemic" communities in regime-formation;              
              2)  the significance of ethical principles of stewardship;  3)                 
              the extent of the obligation to protect environmental public goods;            
              4)  the difficulties of overcoming pluralism; and 5)  the relation             
              between interantional regimes and international orders.  The                   
              working group would meet twice to plan and discuss papers which,               
              after critical review and revision, would serve as the basis of a              
              unified anthology.  The principal investigator would also write and            
              publish articules examining principles and practices of regime-                
              formation among nations sharing a regional biological commons.                 
                                                                                             
              The topic of this proposal is of high priority for Ethics and                  
              Values Studies and Human Dimensions of Global Change.  The                     
              qualifications and track record of the investigator and proposed               
              members of the working group are excellent.  The project provides              
              an important test for theories about the development of                        
              international regimes for the provision of public goods.  Results              
              will be useful for a wide range of individuals and groups.  The                
              proposal is recommended for support.
