Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Exocytosis, a regulatory mechanism of eukaryotic cells, is a                   
              cellular process by which internal membrane-bound vesicles fuse                
              with the plasma membrane to release substances into the external               
              medium.  It is hypothesized that the process of secretion occurs               
              by exocytosis.  The objective of this Research Planning Grant for              
              Women Scientists and Engineers, is to test the hypothesis by                   
              taking a physiological approach to study the role of post-                     
              translational modification in vesicle release.  Dr. Jay will                   
              employ electrophysiological techniques, specifically whole cell                
              patch clamping, to measure cell capacitance in two neuronal                    
              systems, PC12 cells and synaptosomes.  The effects on exocytosis               
              should be accompanied by a change in capacitance.  Results from                
              this research will provide additional information on this                      
              mechanism of neuronal secretion.
