Abstract    :
              Transcription of the HO gene in the yeast S. cerevisiae is subject             
              to three separate types of control.  Transcription is repressed in             
              diploids, (a/d repression); it is activated in haploids, but only              
              those which have undergone cell division (mother cells).  Finally,             
              activation of HO transcription is restricted to the late GI phase              
              of the cell cycle (cell cycle control).  UAS elements in distinct              
              upstream regulatory regions (URS) mediate mother/daughter control              
              (URSI) and cell cycle control (URS2).  These UAS elements can act              
              automonously to activate HO transcription when they are physically             
              separated from each other.  However, within the context of the HO              
              promoter, neither UAS is sufficient to activate transcription.                 
              Deletions which remove URSI from the HO promoter prevent HO                    
              transcription.  In addition, mutations in either of two regulatory             
              proteins which specifically mediate transcription from the UAS in              
              URS2 also eliminate HO transcription.  Such results imply the                  
              existence of an additional negative control region within the                  
              intact promoter whose action is only overcome when both URSI and               
              URS2 are active.  The experiments in this research planning grant              
              are designed to genetically identify and characterize the sites                
              and trans-acting factors involved in this negative control.
