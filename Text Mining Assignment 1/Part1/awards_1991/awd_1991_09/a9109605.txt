Abstract    :
                 This is a Career Advancement Award to support Dr. Malinowska's              
              proposed attempt to clone the gastric apical membrane chloride                 
              channel protein.  This is the channel which plays a major role in              
              the secretion of hydrochloric acid into the stomach by the parietal            
              cell.  Dr. Malinowska has a long-standing interest in the                      
              biochemistry and biophysics of parietal cell chloride secretion.               
              In order to clone the channel, Dr. Malinowska will have to acquire             
              new skills and expertise.                                                      
                                                                                             
              It is anticipated that the successful cloning of the parietal cell             
              chloride channel will lead to important new insights into the                  
              function and regulation of the channel, and will significantly                 
              enhance Dr. Malinowska's career.
