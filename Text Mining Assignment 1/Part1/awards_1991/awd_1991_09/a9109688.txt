Abstract    :
              Points in scene, when illuminated, reflect light not only in                   
              the direction of the sensor but also between themselves.  These                
              interreflections can appreciably alter the appearance of the                   
              scene.  Existing vision sensors and algorithms do not account for              
              the effects of interreflections and hence often produce erroneous              
              results.  An initial investigation studied the effects of                      
              interreflections on shape information recovered by shape-from-                 
              intensity methods (e.g. photometric stereo).  It was discovered                
              that, for Lambertian surfaces, the erroneous (pseudo) shape                    
              recovered in the presence of interreflections is unique and can                
              be mathematically related to the actual shape.  An algorithm has               
              been developed that uses a physical interreflection model to                   
              recover the actual shape of the surface from the psuedo shape.                 
              The research will be extended in the following directions.                     
              (1) The analysis of non-Lambertian (e.g. specular)                             
              interreflections.  This entails the development of mathematical                
              models for non-Lambertian interreflections as well as their                    
              application to the problem of recovering accurate shape in the                 
              presence of interreflections.  (2) The detection and correction                
              of errors produced by existing vision sensors (spot scanners,                  
              light stripe range finders, stereo systems) as a result of                     
              interreflections.  For each sensor, a sensor model is used to                  
              obtain physical constraints that aid the analysis of                           
              interreflections.  All analytical results will be verified by                  
              laboratory experiments.  This research should achieve (a)                      
              fundamental advances in the analysis of interreflections and (b)               
              substantial improvements in vision sensing technology.
