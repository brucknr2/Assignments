Abstract    :
              This effort by the Center for Policy Research of the National                  
              Governors Association (NGA) will provide technical assistance to               
              states seeking to implement the recommendations contained in the               
              NGA studies, Increasing the Supply of Women and Minority Engineers:            
              An Agenda for State Action.  Specifically, NGA will select five                
              states to receive small matching grants to be used in implementing             
              one or more of the recommendations in the report.  NGA will provide            
              technical assistance and support to these states, monitor their                
              progress, and disseminate information on policies and programs they            
              implement.  The project will be completed over an 18 month period.
