Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                                         ABSTRACT                                            
                                                                                             
                                                                                            
              This project continues and elaborates research begun under NSF                 
              grants BNS 8812552 and BNS 9009232 from September, 1988, through               
              August, 1991.  The research conducted during that period looks at              
              the role of urbanization in language change.  In addition to                   
              providing substantive conclusions about urbanization and language              
              change and the "divergence hypothesis," that work develops                     
              innovative techniques for gathering and linking synchronic and                 
              diachronic data and explores several analytical techniques, such               
              as cluster analysis and ARCINFO computer mapping, that are new to              
              linguistics.  The new work builds on those techniques, on                      
              spectrographic study, and on diffusion models developed in                     
              cultural geography to expand the analysis begun in earlier phases              
              and to apply the results to some fundamental questions about                   
              language change and the role of social context in variation and                
              change.  Specifically, the work addresses these questions.                     
              First, do grammatical changes originate and spread in ways                     
              similar to phonological ones?  Second, are there some general                  
              principles of linguistic diffusion that account for the spread of              
              changes?  Third, how do linguistic changes originate?  Do they                 
              arise through language contact alone, or can they be internally                
              motivated?  Fourth, what is the relationship between internally                
              (i.e., linguistically) motivated changes (which most of the ones               
              we have studied seem to be) and the social factors that seem to                
              trigger their spread?  Finally, is there an overall direction to               
              language change in vernacular dialects?
