Abstract    :
                   This research is to devise and evaluate solutions for the                 
              automation and integration of mold and die finishing. A                        
              comprehensive system, where a multi-axis Computer Numeric Control              
              (CNC) Machining Center is to be used to perform all the operations             
              from rough milling to final grinding and polishing of molds and                
              dies, is to be developed. This is based on an unified system of                
              tool path planning and generation from an initial data base of bi-             
              cubic surface patch description. This approach will aim to provide             
              a means to automatically generate final grinding, polishing and in-            
              process surface roughness inspection toolpaths, directly from a                
              three dimensional surface or solid computer model thus avoiding the            
              need to build a physical model.                                                
                   Many industrial products are manufactured by processes that               
              utilize dies and molds. These are currently manufactured by manual             
              techniques that are time consuming, labor intensive and expensive.             
              This research will attempt to automate this process thus improving             
              the productivity and competitive ability of the manufacturing                  
              sector.
