Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Recursive methods are now in wide use in macroeconomics and                    
              capital theory because they permit researchers to rigorously                   
              derive useful and in some cases profound insights into economic                
              dynamics.  Most such applications depend critically on the                     
              assumption that all agents can be represented by the same                      
              representative agent.  The representative agent assumption                     
              precludes the use of these models to study issues involving                    
              distribution, private information or both.  The present project                
              develops a new, recursive method for constructing efficient                    
              allocations in an interesting class of heterogeneous agent                     
              models.  The models will be extended to aggregate uncertainty and              
              to decentralized planning.                                                     
                                                                                             
              This project develops a theory of the dynamics of the income                   
              distribution in a market economy.  Its central technical idea is               
              a new Bellman equation for constructing and characterizing                     
              efficient allocations in economies with differently situated                   
              households and private information.  This equation is used to                  
              study income distribution, asset pricing and optimal taxation.
