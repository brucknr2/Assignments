Abstract    :
              This project is awarded under the program:  Career                             
              Advancement Awards for Women Scientists and Engineers.  The                    
              Principal Investigator will travel to the Tree Ring Research                   
              Laboratory at the University of Arizona (Tucson) to be                         
              trained in the latest analysis techniques that can be                          
              applied to fossil material.  The paleoclimate information                      
              that is obtained from this analysis will be correlated with                    
              data from sedimentological and floristic work high southern                    
              latitudes during the Triassic and Permian.  This work will                     
              facilitate a comparison of paleoclimate models which are                       
              based primarily on physical data with data from plant                          
              biology and growth.
