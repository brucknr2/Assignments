Abstract    :
              This interagency agreement between the National Science                        
              Foundation (NSF) and the Department of State (DOS) supports                    
              the NSF/Europe office.  Operating funds for salaries,                          
              benefits, housing, educational allowances, etc., are provided                  
              by DOS and subsequently reimbursed to DOS by NSF.  The                         
              NSF/Europe office serves as an important link between the                      
              American and European scientific communities through the                       
              dissemination of technical information, the development of ad                  
              hoc reports, and interaction with international organizations                  
              (NATO, OECD, UNESCO, the European Science Foundation, etc.).                   
              This office provides an excellent opportunity for U.S.                         
              scientists to keep abreast of changes and advances in European                 
              science and technology activities and the status of European                   
              science.  NSF/Europe facilitates the Foundation's ability to                   
              access and maintain liaison with European centers of excellence                
              and to target the activities conducted under the bilateral                     
              programs of the Division of International Programs.
