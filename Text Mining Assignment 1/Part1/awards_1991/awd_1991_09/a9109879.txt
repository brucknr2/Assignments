Abstract    :
              Dr. Greenbaum proposes to study the environment-specific                       
              photodynamic activity of a group of synthetic metalloporphyrins                
              used as heme oxygenase inhibitors.  Absorption of light by some                
              of these porphyrins in aerobic environments results in generation              
              of singlet oxygen, which may cause irreversible modification of                
              target biological molecules.  The photoreacitivity of a                        
              particular compound depends upon the central metal atom, ring                  
              substituents, and the environment in which the porphyrin is                    
              localized.  By use of various biochemical and spectroscopic                    
              techniques, the importance of electrostatic interactions in                    
              porphyrin-porphyrin, porphyrin-protein, and porphyrin-membrane                 
              associations and specific mechanisms of porphyrin-mediated damage              
              to the various targets in these model systems will be studied.
