Abstract    :
                   Filament winding is an efficient method for manufacturing                 
              large, high-performance composite shells and structures.  The                  
              research will investigate the use of infrared heating to                       
              continuously-cure filament-wound composite structures as they are              
              being wound onto a mandrel or preform.  Fundamental to proving the             
              viability of this novel process is understanding the radiative heat            
              transfer upon the winding's surface and its affect upon the resin's            
              cure kinetics, optical characteristics, and mechanical properties.             
              To this end, these characteristics will be measured and a thermo-              
              mechanical model will be developed to describe the concurrent                  
              winding-curing process.  "Proof-of-Principle" experiments will be              
              conducted using pilot-scale infrared oven with thermal imaging                 
              equipment with a bench-scale filament-winder.                                  
                   Comparisons will be made as to the efficiency of continuous               
              curing versus batch curing.  In the event that manufacturers are               
              interested in commercializing this technology, process procedures              
              and design guidelines will be developed.
