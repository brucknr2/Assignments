Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              These experiments will examine why some foods stimulate                        
              overeating (hyperphagia).  This research is based on the finding               
              that the addition of an artificial sweetener (saccharin) to high-              
              moisture foods stimulates long-term energy intake of laboratory                
              rats.  Pre-exposing rats to either the unflavored food or                      
              saccharin in water blocks the ability of saccharin to increase                 
              energy intake; this is called the pre-exposure effect.                         
                                                                                             
              In all experiments, rats will either be pre-exposed or not pre-                
              exposed to flavors and then fed test diets for several weeks.                  
              Test diets will contain either no added flavor, saccharin,                     
              monosodium glutamate, citric acid, or vanilla.  Experiments                    
              involving saccharin will determine whether or not rats learn                   
              relationships between the flavor of saccharin and subsequent                   
              absorption of food energy, whether or not experience with                      
              saccharin in food influences subsequent preference for saccharin,              
              and whether or not the pre-exposure effect persists over time.                 
                                                                                             
              The information obtained from these experiments should improve                 
              our understanding of how chemosensory stimuli influence energy                 
              intake and growth.  This, in turn, will be useful for developing               
              treatments that increase or decrease energy intake by humans and               
              domestic animals, as well as assist those developing improved                  
              foods and beverages.
