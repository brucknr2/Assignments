Abstract    :
                   In this project the principal investigator will initiate                  
              preliminary work to determine the feasibility of extending one-                
              dimensional techniques to investigate the rates of convergence of              
              two-dimensional Fourier series and more general eigenfunction                  
              expansions of Sturm-Liouville type.  In particular, she will                   
              consider rates of convergence and the asymptotic behavior of                   
              partial sums of functions of bounded variation and functions whose             
              derivatives have bounded variation.                                            
                   Problems involving eigenfunction expansions arise in a host of            
              areas of applied mathematics and engineering.  There are two basic             
              questions that need to be answered.  The first involves the rate of            
              convergence of the expansion and the second involves the asymptotic            
              behavior of the partial sums as the number of terms increases to               
              infinity.  The principal investigator plans on answering these                 
              questions for series expansions in two dimensions by extending                 
              techniques that have worked for series in one dimension.
