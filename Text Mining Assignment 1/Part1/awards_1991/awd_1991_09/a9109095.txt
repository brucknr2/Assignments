Abstract    :
                   In this project the principal investigator will study                     
              systematically the zeros of orthogonal Laurent polynomials (L-                 
              polynomials) related to strongly positive-definite moment                      
              functionals.  This study will parallel the study of the zeros of               
              classical orthogonal polynomials.  In particular, the principal                
              investigator will look at the separation properties of the zeros               
              and establish the connection between the zeros and the spectrum of             
              a natural representative of the polynomials.  She will also study              
              the relationship between the zeros and the true interval of                    
              orthogonality of the L-polynomials.                                            
                   The theory of classical orthogonal polynomials is rich in                 
              mathematical content and in applications' value to a host of                   
              problems in approximation theory, numerical analysis and                       
              differential equations.  In this the project the principal                     
              investigator will attempt to construct an analogous theory for a               
              class of generalized orthogonal polynomials called Laurent                     
              polynomials.  In particular, she will study the properties of the              
              zeros of such polynomials, in order to broaden the mathematical                
              theory of these objects and to explore exciting applications of                
              Laurent polynomials in approximation theory.//
