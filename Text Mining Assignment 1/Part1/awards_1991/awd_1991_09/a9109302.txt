Abstract    :
              This grant will provide for the initiation of a new National                   
              Research Council (NRC) activity, a Board on Engineering Education.             
              The Board will be one of the major units of the NRC with oversight             
              jointly provided by the Commission on Engineering and Technical                
              Systems and the Office of Scientific and Engineering Personnel.                
              The primary purpose of the Board will be to provide a continuing               
              capability to assess the environment for engineering education in              
              the United States and to develop strategies for shaping and                    
              implementing national engineering education policies at all levels.            
              The Board will serve as an institutional focus at the national                 
              level that can coordinate, monitor, and advocate action for the                
              advancement of engineering education.
