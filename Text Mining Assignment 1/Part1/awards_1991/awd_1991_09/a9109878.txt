              This research describes the various Gif-type systems which                     
              oxidize selectively saturated hydrocarbons to ketones by                       
              non-radical mechanisms.  Modifications will enable the                         
              selective synthesis of secondary phenylthio-, phenylseleno-,                   
              chloro- and bromo-derivatives of saturated hydrocarbons and of                 
              secondary polysulfides.  In a variation of the GoAggII system                  
              (pyridine - acetic acid - ferric chloride + hydrogen peroxide),                
              a system (GoAggIII) has been developed that oxidizes (30%                      
              conversion) saturated hydrocarbons to ketones nearly                           
              quantitatively.  Two intermediates in this system have been                    
              characterised which will be studied by physical techniques and                 
              by selective trapping. The former are dynamic C-13 NMR, 0-17                   
              NMR, ESCA spectroscopy, Mossbauer spectroscopy and resonance                   
              Raman spectroscopy.                                                            
                                                                                             
              The Organic Synthesis Program is supporting a continuation of                  
              the studies of the complex oxidation system developed by Dr.                   
              Barton to selectively functionalize saturated hydrocarbons.                    
              The chemistry has parallels in the reactions that are catalyzed                
              by the enzyme methane monooxygenase.  This work should lead to                 
              a system that can perform this important reaction in a                         
              synthetically useful manner.
