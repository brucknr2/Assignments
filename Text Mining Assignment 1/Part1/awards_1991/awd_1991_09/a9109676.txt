Abstract    :
              The technique of X-ray crystallography will be used to study the               
              three dimensional structure of hemocyanin, the oxygen transport                
              protein found in arthropods and molluscs.  The invertebrate                    
              hemocyanins are particularly interesting because the oxygen binding            
              site consists of two copper ions ligated directly by protein side              
              chains.  The exact nature and geometry of these metal sites are                
              still in question.  The major goal of the proposed research is to              
              obtain diffraction data, determine and refine the oxygenated                   
              structure of a subunit of hemocyanin in order to understand how the            
              oxygen molecule binds to the binuclear cooper site.
