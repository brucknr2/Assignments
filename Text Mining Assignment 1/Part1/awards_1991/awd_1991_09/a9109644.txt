Abstract    :
              This proposal describes a program of research to examine some of               
              the factors likely to affect the diagnostic problem-solving                    
              performance of work teams that run multi-operator systems,  It                 
              is concerned most specifically with those situations in which teams            
              are confronted with sudden, critical system malfunctions.  The                 
              proposed research is founded on a conceptual framework that                    
              delineates the informational bases of coordinated team problem-                
              solving.  That framework emphasizes the importance of --- and                  
              structural barriers to --- discussing diagnostic information                   
              that initially may be available to only some team members.  Five               
              controlled laboratories experiments are proposed to examine the                
              impact of several situational factors likely to affect the way in              
              which teams use the information at their disposal when diagnosing              
              critical system malfunctions.
