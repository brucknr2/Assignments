Abstract    :
              The objectives of the proposed research are to design and                      
              verify a technique for modeling dynamic consolidation using                    
              a centrifuge, and to investigate the densification pattern                     
              resulting from single and multiple impacts in dry, granular                    
              soils. The research is expected to generate significant                        
              insight into the phenomenon of dynamic consolidation, and                      
              provide specific information to practicing engineers involved                  
              in design of dynamic consolidation oriented work.
