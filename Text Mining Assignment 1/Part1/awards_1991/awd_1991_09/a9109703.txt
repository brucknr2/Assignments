Abstract    :
              This project is to continue the development of implantable force               
              transducers to measure the load on tendons for up to three weeks.              
              The experimental work will be supplemented by a mathematical                   
              model to account for the interactions between the transducer and               
              the tissue; the model should be helpful in the calibration of the              
              transducers.  The work, if successful, will aid the understanding              
              of the long term behavior of tendons, and may lead to the more                 
              scientific design of tissue substitutes.
