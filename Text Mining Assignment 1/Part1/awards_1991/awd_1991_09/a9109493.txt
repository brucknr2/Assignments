Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This action is to help defray the costs of American scientists                 
              who are attending an international meeting.  The meeting is the                
              13th Interamerican Congress which will bring together North                    
              American and South American behavioral and social scientists for               
              the purpose of interacting in meaningful scientific dialogue.                  
              The meeting makes opportunities for these scientists to share                  
              their research experiences as well as a chance to initiate                     
              collaborations among and between scientists of diverse nations.
