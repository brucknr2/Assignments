Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              The proposed research is to continue and to expand computer                    
              simulations of new phenomena in strongly perturbed quantum systems.            
              Program codes to obtain time-dependent quantum mechanical wave                 
              functions for one-electron atoms and negative ions in very intense             
              and short-pulse radiative environments have been developed.  These             
              wave functions have led to new predictions and satisfactory semi-              
              quantitative comparisons with experiments carried out in the last few          
              years.  The concept of these wave functions will be extended to two-           
              electron systems in high-intensity laser fields.  These calculations           
              will be the first exact quantum calculations of that type which fully          
              counts for all interactions (electron-atom, electron-field and                 
              electron-electron) for a quantum system.  They will provide a novel            
              opportunity for systematic tests of the range of validity of                   
              approximations involved in traditional multi-electron radiation                
              theories.//
