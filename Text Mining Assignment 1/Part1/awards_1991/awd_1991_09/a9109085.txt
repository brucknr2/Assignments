Abstract    :
                This research will analyze earthquake data collected on                      
              portable seismometers during the APT89 experiment along a line                 
              from the Wyoming craton to the Western Superior Province of the                
              Canadian Shield (Western Ontario).  Shear-wave splitting will be               
              used to investigate anisotropy, travel times of body waves will                
              be mapped, and phase interaction with boundaries such as the Moho              
              and core-mantle interface will be used to map lateral variations.              
              Spanning two major geologic boundaries, the experiment was                     
              designed to study the seismological properties of the crust,                   
              upper mantle and core-mantle boundary along the traverse.
