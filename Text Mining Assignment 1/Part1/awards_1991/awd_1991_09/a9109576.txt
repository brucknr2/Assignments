Abstract    :
              The objectives of this project are: i) preparation of                          
              good optical quality single crystal films of specific                          
              conjugated polymers, ii) preparation of special                                
              channel waveguide structures such as directional                               
              coupler, Mach-Zehnder interferometer and Febry-                                
              Perot etalon etc. from the single crystal films and                            
              iii) study nonlinear optical effects in these special                          
              structures using time and wavelength resolved                                  
              measurements.  Specific conjugated polymers such                               
              as polydiacetylenes are known to have extremely                                
              large nonlinear refractive indices along with low                              
              absorption coefficients in their off-resonant                                  
              domains.
