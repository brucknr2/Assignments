Abstract    :
              The present proposal is a request to the NSF to assist in                      
              equipping research facilities for the evolutionary biology                     
              program at Yale University.  The six principal investigators on                
              this proposal represent a diversity of research programs yet with              
              common research strategies that make it very effective to share                
              common facilities.  The overall theme of the research is to                    
              understand evolutionary mechanisms as they apply to molecular                  
              cellular, and developmental system.  The major pieces of                       
              equipment to be purchased are an oligonucleotide synthesizer for               
              synthesis of primers for DNA sequencing, an automated DNA                      
              sequencer, a computerized analytic system for acquisition and                  
              analysis of molecular data, especially DNA sequence data, a                    
              microscopic video computer system to allow analysis of still and               
              motion images, and centrifuges and a scintillation counter.  In                
              addition to solely research purposes, the new facilities will                  
              serve as training for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows,              
              as well as visiting scientists, in the most modern approaches to               
              evolutionary questions.
