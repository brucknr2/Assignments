Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The long range goal of this research is to compare                             
              astrocyte-neuron interactions in the adult mammalian brain.  A                 
              long held theory concerning one of the roles of astrocytes is                  
              that they support neuronal structure and function.  One way in                 
              which this might be accomplished is by altering their morphology               
              to influence the chemical and physical communication between                   
              neurons by modulating dendritic arbors, synaptic contacts, and                 
              neuronal subgroupings.  Proposed experiments will use a model                  
              system in the brain where activity-related structural                          
              reorganization of astrocytes and neurons has already been shown                
              to occur in the hypothalamic supraoptic nucleus (SON).  The                    
              studies proposed in this application are to test the following                 
              hypotheses:  that SON astrocytes undergo 3-dimensional shape                   
              changes as a result of neuronal function; that SON astrocytes                  
              receive neurochemical signals from neurons that induce shape                   
              changes; that SON astrocytes send neurochemical signals to                     
              neurons to influence their shape at the appropriate times; and                 
              that newly proliferated astrocytes contribute to the                           
              3-dimensional restructuring of the SON.  Several methods that                  
              will include light and electron microscopy, fura-2 imaging (a                  
              measure of intracellular ionic calcium concentrate) of primary                 
              astrocyte cultures, autoradiography and immunohistochemistry will              
              be used to define the nature of astrocyte-neuron configurations                
              and the conditions affecting changes in their morphological                    
              relationships.  These studies are important because although they              
              address basic mechanistic questions, they will lead towards                    
              understanding how the adult brain adapts to experience, and                    
              eventually may lead to an understanding of mechanisms of recovery              
              from brain and spinal cord injuries, as well as degenerative                   
              brain diseases.
