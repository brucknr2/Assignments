Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              How is a preschooler's emotional expression socialized?  This                  
              research will investigate individual differences in pre-school                 
              children's expression and understanding of emotions.  Studies                  
              will explore parental socialization of emotions in 3 1/2 year old              
              children.  The planning grant will provide an opportunity to                   
              improve the methodology and test the feasibility of various                    
              measures of modeling, coaching, and contingency.  After the                    
              planning grant activity has been completed, there will be a                    
              follow-on proposal for a longitudinal, comprehensive test of a                 
              model predicting how socialization about emotions affects the                  
              young child's understanding and expression of emotions.
