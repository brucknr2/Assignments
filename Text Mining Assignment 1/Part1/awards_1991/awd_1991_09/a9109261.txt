Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This support is for a highly successful training course in                     
              developmental and cellular neuroscience, which is given in                     
              alternate years at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods                   
              Hole, Massachusetts.  Students are trained by a team of active                 
              expert research scientists with modern neuroscience technology                 
              and techniques in an intensive environment, using the simple                   
              model system of an invertebrate preparation.  This course                      
              provides an unusually thorough introduction to basic concepts and              
              laboratory approaches to cellular neurobiology, and many of its                
              past students have gone on to strong careers as independent                    
              investigators in all fields of neuroscience.
