Abstract    :
              Dr. Cordero is undertaking a new interpretation of the theory and              
              conceptual problems of quantum mechanics (QM).  His study                      
              emphasizes the role played by credible low-level theories as guides            
              and constraints in the revision of standard QM.  The project                   
              concentrates on the following elements:  1)  The claim that                    
              standard QM is incomplete and needs to be revised rather than                  
              reinterpreted.  2) Problems with approaches that do not modify the             
              time-dependent part of QM.                                                     
              theory as a major step forward, its critique and prospects.  4)                
              Concepts of explanation deployed in the advancement of QM.  5)                 
              Partial theories of spontaneous state reduction induced from the               
              practices of scientists working on specific problems.   6) The use             
              of such theories as a source for non-ad-hoc revisions of QM.  7)               
              Incorporation of partial theories in a generalization of the GRW               
              theory.  8)  The paradoxes generated by collapse variants and their            
              prospects of resolution.  9) Measurement theory within stochastic              
              revisions of QM.  10)  The concepts of 'system,' 'dynamical                    
              property,' 'possibility,' 'actuality,' and 'causal efficacy' in a              
              coherent stochastic single-case QM.
