Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The goal of this project is to understand how nerve cells in              
              the spinal cord produce locomotion. The studies will be conducted              
              using a lower vertebrate as a model system. The spinal cord of                 
              all vertebrate animals is composed of the same types of nerve                  
              cells which are organized in a similar manner, but the spinal                  
              cord of lower vertebrate has fewer cells and simpler behavior;                 
              thus, the decreased complexity makes it a good model system.                   
              These studies will investigate how intersegmental coordination is              
              produced; that would be analogous to studying in humans how the                
              neurons controlling flexion and extension of the hip are                       
              coordinated with the neurons controlling flexion and extension of              
              the knee and ankle. The principle investigator, Dr. Karen                      
              Sigvardt, will work in collaboration with mathematicians to                    
              develop a mathematical framework for the results of the studies                
              which will utilize both physiological and anatomical techniques.               
              This work will contribute to knowledge about the way in which the              
              spinal cord controls coordinated movements.
