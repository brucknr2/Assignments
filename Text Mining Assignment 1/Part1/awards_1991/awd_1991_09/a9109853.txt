              SUCCEED has two primary goals: to improve the quality and relevance            
              of their degree programs; and to impact broadly engineering                    
              education in the 21st-century.  In pursuing these goals, they will             
              increase student retention, engineering enrollments and numbers of             
              SUCCEED graduates, while recruiting, retaining, and graduating more            
              women, minority, and handicapped student engineers.                            
                                                                                             
              SUCCEED's curriculum restructuring plan focuses on: integration of             
              all subjects with engineering design and practice; elimination of              
              course and infrastructure barriers to curriculum innovation; and               
              consideration of engineering as a process and a system.  SUCCEED's             
              management plan focuses on: instilling personal traits of                      
              innovation, teamwork, and leadership; and stimulating                          
              organizational traits leading to quality products, customer                    
              service, and an on-going product improvement process.  SUCCEED will            
              be organized as an experimental Engineering Education Management               
              System (EEMS) comprised of four distributed, multi-institutional               
              centers which will promote inter- and intra-institutional                      
              collaborations and establish an environment for exploring                      
              engineering education.  The four distributed centers are:  1)                  
              Center for Curriculum Development (University of Florida); 2)                  
              Center for Human Resource Development (Georgia Institute of                    
              Technology); 3) Center for Engineering Design and Processes (North             
              Carolina State University); and 4) Center for Information and                  
              Technology (Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University).              
                                                                                             
              SUCCEED will achieve: an evaluation of a new engineering curriculum            
              blueprint called Curriculum-21; an increase in the total numbers               
              of female and minority students by 50% coalition-wide; an increase             
              in student retention by 50% and in four-year graduation rates by               
              a proportionate amount; an improvement in the number of students               
              pursuing graduate degrees; the promotion of math and science                   
              education in K-12; the promotion of basic technology literacy for              
              non-engineering graduates; and an improvement in the alternative               
              entry interface with community colleges and 2 and 4-year                       
              institutions.  In addition, SUCCEED will determine the                         
              prerequisites and guidelines for integrating principles and                    
              practices of Total Quality Management into the engineering                     
              curriculum, engineering management, and engineering processes.
