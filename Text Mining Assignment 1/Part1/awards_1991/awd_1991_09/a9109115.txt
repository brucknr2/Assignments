Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project is supported under the Research                                   
              Initiation Awards (RIA) Program, FY 91.  The                                   
              objective of this research is to perform a 3-                                  
              D study of reinforced concrete (R/C)                                           
              structures on the adverse effects of                                           
              nonproportional deformations on the inelastic                                  
              response of R/C members.  A finite element                                     
              model which includes an assemblage of                                          
              inelastic solid elements to model the                                          
              concrete and elastic-plastic bar elements                                      
              representing the reinforcing steel will be                                     
              used to study the complex interaction between                                  
              the axial and lateral deformations.                                            
                                                                                             
              As a case study, the response of ICS Building                                  
              during the Imperial Valley Earthquake of Oct.                                  
              15, 1979 will be evaluated.  Further                                           
              parametric study at the elements level will                                    
              be also performed to advance the knowledge                                     
              and to satisfy the need for detailed                                           
              information on the force-displacement                                          
              response of R/C columns under uncoupled                                        
              fluctuation of axial and lateral loads.  The                                   
              results of this project are expected to                                        
              improve the understanding of the cyclic                                        
              behavior of R/C structures and members, and                                    
              to impact the seismic design practices of R/C                                  
              structures.
