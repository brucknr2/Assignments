Abstract    :
              This is an ROW/Planning Grant.  In recent years, work in speech                
              act theory has yielded results of practical interest,                          
              particularly for the design of user interfaces, intelligent                    
              systems, and programming languages.  Techniques have been                      
              developed for general reasoning about actions, and for inference               
              of intentions from typewritten dialogue.  This project adds                    
              intonation to the model's language cues.  A parametric study of                
              spoken language use will be conducted, to support the                          
              hypothesisthat computing intentions is improved by exploiting                  
              acoustic parameters (particularly the fundamental frequency                    
              contours) of utterances.  Speakers' reports of their own                       
              intentions, and hearers' judgements of intent will be used, to                 
              determine the roleof intonation relative to linguistic structure               
              and contextual cues.  The work will attempt to develop a calculus              
              relating international features and speech act types, and fold it              
              into the existing speech act recognition system.  Acoustic cues                
              may provide new insight into the dynamic nature of action and                  
              communication.
