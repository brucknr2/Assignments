Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                                         ABSTRACT                                            
                                                                                             
                                                                                            
              The purpose of this project is to prepare as complete                          
              documentation as possible of the Kiowa language, a Native                      
              American language that is not far from extinction.  This                       
              documentation will take the form of a collection of texts and a                
              dictionary, which will accompany the published grammar of Kiowa.               
              The texts, which will be translated, linguistically analyzed, and              
              annotated for grammatical and cultural points of interest, range               
              from personal anecdotes to traditional legends and native                      
              language written correspondence.  Including both written and                   
              spoken material, they provide rich exemplification of connected                
              Kiowa discourse.  The dictionary, based on field work and                      
              published sources, will enable researchers interested in                       
              historical work on Kiowa-Tanoan as well as those exploring                     
              synchronic questions of phonology and lexical structure to                     
              examine data from a little known but typologically interesting                 
              Native American language.
