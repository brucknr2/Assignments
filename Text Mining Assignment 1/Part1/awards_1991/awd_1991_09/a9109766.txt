                                         ABSTRACT                                            
                                                                                            
              This project studies one subsystem of human language, inflection               
              (the ability to derive walked from walk or wives from wife).  The              
              phenomenon is to be studied in intensive detail from a variety of              
              disciplines, aiming at a unified theory and database of how the                
              system works computationally, how it is learned, how it varies                 
              represented in the brain.  A key hypothesis is that regular                    
              inflection (walk-walks) is computed by a very general mental rule              
              ("add -ed") whereas irregular inflection (come-came) involves                  
              memorization of two separate words in an associative memory,                   
              allowing limited generalization only to similar-sounding words.                
              This hypothesis, which bears on current study of connectionist                 
              and symbol-processing models of cognition, predicts that regular               
              and irregular inflection should dissociate in a variety of ways.               
              The project include tests of how speakers of English and other                 
              languages apply inflectional patterns to existing and new words,               
              experiments where subjects produce and recognize inflected forms               
              in real time, crosslinguistic surveys of universals and variation              
              in inflectional systems, and model construction.
