Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project studies and compares three alternative methods of                 
              measuring willingness-to-accept to find acceptable solutions to the            
              problem of siting hazardous waste facilities.  They are the                    
              contingency valuation survey, laboratory experimental method, and              
              the structured focus group or public value forum.  Each method has             
              advantages and disadvantages.  The focus of the investigation will             
              be to compare the effectiveness of these three alternatives in                 
              obtaining willingness-to-accept measures, so that an acceptable                
              solution to the hazardous waste facility siting problem may become             
              evident.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              Information from this investigation will be useful in wording                  
              questions used in community referenda that determine the acceptance            
              or rejection of a hazardous waste facility.  Such referenda can                
              include a compensation package which is used to make more                      
              attractive the siting of an hazardous waste facility in a                      
              community.  Additionally, such information will be useful in                   
              investigating the ethical and equity implications of certain                   
              socioeconomic factors such as education and income in willingness-             
              to-accept responses.
