Abstract    :
              Past research by this investigator established a new method for                
              analyzing outdoor scenes.  Thermal and visual imagery was                      
              combined to extract internal object properties that serve as                   
              physically meaningful features for region labeling.  This new                  
              research presents an improved formulation of the energy exchange               
              model used for this purpose.  The energy exchange model is                     
              formulated as a linear regression model.  Statistically robust                 
              techniques will be used to extract reliable estimates of internal              
              object properties such as thermal capacitance.  These techniques               
              allow reliable estimates in spite of almost 50% of the data being              
              arbitrarily corrupted due to misregistration of images and                     
              segmentation errors.  Statistically robust techniques have been                
              shown to be beneficial in many important computer vision problems              
              such as pose estimation, straight-line extraction, computation of              
              image structure, and surface fitting.  The proposed research will              
              explore statistical robust approaches to another important                     
              problem, i.e., sensor fusion.  The computational characteristics               
              of the robust algorithms will be explored for the chosen sensor                
              fusion task.  The new formulation also allows iterative                        
              refinement of surface parameters (such as thermal emissivity)                  
              which were assumed known in the previous formulation of the                    
              model.  The new approach thus improves the accuracy of the                     
              internal property value estimates and also provides new                        
              information regarding surface parameter values.  The method thus               
              provides a greater number of stable features for object                        
              classification.
