Abstract    :
              This award will assist the University of Wisconsin purchase                    
              several pieces of shared equipment for a group of nine                         
              investigators who are involved in basic plant biology research.                
              The research to be pursued with the equipment includes; (1)                    
              molecular evolution, (2) starch metabolism, (3) molecular biology              
              of plant detoxification mechanism, (4) salt transport, (5) purine              
              metabolism in plants, (6) nitrogen fixation, (7) cereal endosperm              
              development, and (8) the molecular mechanisms of protein turnover              
              in plants.  Plant materials used by these researchers vary from                
              the model organism, Arabidopsis, to soybean, oats, Brassica and                
              alfalfa.  The equipment to be purchased includes plant growth                  
              chambers, an oligonucleotide synthesizer, spectrophotometer, and               
              centrifuges.  These shared pieces of equipment will greatly                    
              facilitate advances of plant biology research at the University                
              of Wisconsin, and will increase already active interactions among              
              plant scientists in several departments.
