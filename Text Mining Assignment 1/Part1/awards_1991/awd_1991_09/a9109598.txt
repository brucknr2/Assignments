Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The avian song control system provides a model for many aspects                
              of neural integration, plasticity, and learning.  Songbirds learn              
              their songs by imitating external models, and the major brain                  
              nuclei involved in vocal behavior have been identified.  Dr.                   
              David Vicario will employ physiological, anatomical, and                       
              behavioral techniques to study the development, organization and               
              operational principles of this system, conceived of as a circuit               
              assembled from cellular components.  The main experimental theme               
              will be the initiation of learned vocalizations and their                      
              assembly out of respiratory and syringeal components.  The                     
              results of this work will help elucidate how learned and                       
              unlearned elements are combined to produce a complex behavior and              
              how they are represented in the brain.
