Abstract    :
              The overall approach of the proposed work is to                                
              fundamentally understand the mechanisms of cell damage in                      
              contrast to the phenomenological/correlation type of                           
              approach which has been historically used to address this                      
              problem.  The proposed approach requires the                                   
              identification of the processes responsible for cell                           
              damage through initial visualization studies.  Theoretical                     
              and correlational studies are then to be carried out in                        
              actual bioreactor operations to confirm that these                             
              mechanisms account for the observed cell damage.  Once                         
              these mechanisms are confirmed, computer simulations of                        
              the hydrodynamic events, such as bubble rupture, will be                       
              used to determine the actual "strength" or "sensitivity"                       
              of cells to hydrodynamic forces.
