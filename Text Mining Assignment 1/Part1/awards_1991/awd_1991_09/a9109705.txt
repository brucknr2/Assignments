Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The focus of Dr. Keshner's work is to determine the relationship               
              between neck muscle activation patterns and changes at the                     
              intervertebral joints. During performance of slow, sinusoidal                  
              tracking movements of the head, muscle electromyographic recordings            
              will be made simultaneously with fluoroscopic images of vertebral              
              motion. Recordings from eight neck muscles and fluoroscopic images             
              of seven cervical vertebrae will be stored on-line for later                   
              analysis. Correlational measures will be performed to explore the              
              force-velocity relationships between individual neck muscles and               
              the cervical intervertebral joints. Intra- and inter-subject                   
              variability will also be examined to determine whether variabililty            
              in the motor system produces variations in the joint displacement              
              patterns. This work will contribute to basic knowledge about how               
              motor programs are organized with respect to the anatomical                    
              constraints of the motor system.
