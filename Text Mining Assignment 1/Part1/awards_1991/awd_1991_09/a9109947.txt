Abstract    :
              This project addresses the control of multiple interconnected                  
              mechanical systems.  Such systems have applications ranging from               
              robots in factories to spacecraft with multiple appendages.  The               
              research objective is the development of an efficient                          
              computational algorithm for minimum time control synthesis  of                 
              such systems, and the feedback implementation of such systems.                 
              Current approaches to controlling this class of system suffer                  
              from time consuming computational difficulties in convergence to               
              the optimal solution.  This project attempts to refine the                     
              current method and increase the algorithmic efficiency.  The                   
              research comprises four steps, including (1) development of an                 
              efficient computational algorithm for open loop minimum time                   
              control synthesis using continuation methods and bifurcation                   
              theory, (2) development of closed loop implementation schemes for              
              executing the resulting minimal time trajectory, (3) validation                
              of these methods by both simulation and experimentation, and (4)               
              exploration of the possibility of generalization to flexible body              
              systems  and problems with state constraints.
