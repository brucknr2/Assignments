Abstract    :
              Reliable information about the in-place early-age strength of                  
              concrete can be used to improve the safety and economy of concrete             
              construction.  For example, reliable measurements of in-place                  
              concrete strength can be used to determine when adequate strength              
              has been obtained to allow removal of shoring, transfer of                     
              prestressing, application of post-tensioning, and termination of               
              curing.  In-place strength information allows each of these                    
              operations to proceed safely and at the earliest possible time,                
              leading to more economical construction. The objective of the                  
              proposed research is to continue development of a new test method,             
              the impact-echo method, for measuring in-place early age concrete              
              strength.  In this study, the impact-echo method will be                       
              established between P-wave velocity and concrete strength.  This               
              correlation relationship will be established using cylindrical                 
              concrete specimens is applicable to plate-like concrete structural             
              elements such as slabs and walls.  This work represents an                     
              advancement towards the development of a standardized test for                 
              measuring the in-place strength of concrete using the impact-echo              
              method.
