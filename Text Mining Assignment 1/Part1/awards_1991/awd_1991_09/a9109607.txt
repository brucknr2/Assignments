Abstract    :
              This project focuses on the transition period between leaving                  
              school and obtaining one's first full-time job.  It is generally               
              observed that the difficulty in obtaining the first job increases              
              the longer one is without a job, and that the wage received on the             
              first deceases as well with the length of the search period.  In               
              addition, groups which have shorter transition periods also tend               
              to have higher wages.  These observations are not easily reconciled            
              within standard economic models of job search.  It has been shown              
              that a bargaining model in which the value of the firm-worker                  
              pairing is split according to each party's value of continuing to              
              search can potentially explain these empirical regularities.  The              
              purpose of this research is to estimate rigorously such a                      
              bargaining model using data on the length of the transition period             
              and wages for individuals from different race-schooling groups.                
              This research is important because estimation will not only provide            
              explanations for the data, but also will enable one to analyze the             
              impact of alternative intervention policies such as minimum wages              
              and unemployment compensation on the school-to-work transition.
