Abstract    :
                   Significant advances in the design and miniaturization of                 
              nanostructutes can be made with the aid of computer simulation,                
              especially in light of recent developments in parallel algorithms              
              and computer architectures.  The most widely used nanostructures               
              are epitaxially grown semiconducting devices, however embedded                 
              microclusters in porous materials also show considerable                       
              technological potential.                                                       
                   By means of computer simulation, the behavior of nanoscale                
              devices and embedded microclusters in zeolites will be studied.                
              The embedding materials will include group IV and binary I-VII,                
              II-VI and III-V materials.  Molecular dynamics, dynamical                      
              simulated annealing, quantum molecular dynamics, and variational               
              Monte Carlo methods will be used to investigate the properties                 
              and processes in nanostructures.  In addition, new simulation                  
              techniques such as simulated evolution, genetic algorithms, and                
              variational molecular dynamics will be developed to study these                
              quantum confined systems.                                                      
                   The proposed simulation work will exploit the inherent                    
              parallelism by performing them on SIMD (single instruction                     
              multiple data) or MIMD (multiple instruction multiple data)                    
              machines.
