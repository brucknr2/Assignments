Abstract    :
              Scientists and engineers routinely use physical arguments and                  
              graphical representations to organize their thoughts and as parts of           
              the process of solving otherwise verbally presented problems.  The             
              goal of this project is to investigate a computational theory and to           
              develop a system that captures some aspects of this style of                   
              reasoning.  The system, consisting of a suite of computer programs,            
              will have three novel features: (1) Given a set of nonlinear partial           
              differential equations, it will use "back-of-the-envelope"                     
              calculations to determine the appropriate scaling, and automatically           
              simplifies the equations by means of classical singular perturbation           
              techniques, (2) In exploring the physics of the simplified mode, it            
              will combine numerical methods with symbolic results, and (3) To               
              analyze the qualitative behavior of the simplified model, it will use          
              a graphical method based on an analytical approximation criterion for          
              predicting the onset of global chaotic behavior.  The power of the             
              approach will be demonstrated by applying it to a difficult problem in         
              hydrodynamics for which our computer programs help derive previously           
              unknown publishable results.  Successful completion of the project             
              will provide computer programs that are significant not only as a              
              useful problem solving assistant for scientists, but also as an                
              application of Artificial Intelligence techniques to a new and                 
              challenging domain.
