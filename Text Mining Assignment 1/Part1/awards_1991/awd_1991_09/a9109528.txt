Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  An exchange network is comprised of people or other units such            
              as organizations interconnected in a group.  The participants are              
              occupants of positions in the network, and the connections between             
              any two participants or collectively in the group as a whole may               
              be exclusive or inclusive.  Inclusion occurs when two or more                  
              exchanges must be completed for a benefit to be realized from                  
              any of the exchanges.  This condition is in contrast to exclusion              
              which occurs when only one exchange must be completed for a benefit            
              to be realized.  Having to make many exchanges is seen as weakening            
              power or control.  The aim of this research is to examine inclusion            
              as a basis for power in exchange networks.  A series of experiments            
              investigates a variety of networks in order to quantitatively                  
              determine the joint effect of inclusion and exclusion and tests a              
              theory that predicts that the effect of inclusion increases with               
              the number of exchanges but is completely eliminated when exclusion            
              is also present.                                                               
                                                                                             
                   The study of the condition of exclusion has dominated research            
              on exchange networks.  This project will contribute to the                     
              understanding of power relations in exchange networks by                       
              systematically investigating the condition of inclusion.
