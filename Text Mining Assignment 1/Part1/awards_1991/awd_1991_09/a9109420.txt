Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal is designed to further our understanding of unusual              
              contractions in two types of invertebrate muscles.  The thick                  
              filaments of Limulus muscle shorten, by end-fragmentation, in order            
              to accommodate to the shortest in situ sarcomere length.  Molluscan            
              smooth adductors and Mytilus ABRM exhibit tonic contractions:                  
              catch, characterized by maintenance of the active state with no                
              energy use.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              These studies will determine the interactions between core                     
              paramyosin and cortical myosin molecules of these thick filaments              
              and define the changes in these interactions during the unusual                
              contractions of these muscles.  Monoclonal antibodies to the                   
              proteins will be used as probes.  Electron microscopy of:  protein             
              molecules, synthetic protein aggregates, cores and intact filaments            
              will be used to analyze structural changes.  Biochemical assays of             
              protein interactions will define the molecular state characteristic            
              of catch, and the presence of catch in skinned molluscan muscles               
              will be monitored, physiologically.//
