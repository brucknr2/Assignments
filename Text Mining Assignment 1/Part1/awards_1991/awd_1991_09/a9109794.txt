Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Gateway Coalition proposes to open new "gateways" for learning             
              by altering engineering education from a focus on course content               
              to the development of human resources and the broader experience               
              in which individual curriculum parts are connected and integrated.             
              The scope of the program includes four major parts: curriculum                 
              structure, human potential development, instructional technology               
              and methodology, and evaluation measures.  Gateway efforts will                
              broaden, expand and enrich emerging innovations with new issues and            
              a pervasive framework.  The intellectual threads will weave                    
              together: 1) the introduction of engineering and its functional                
              core "up-front," 2) a unified and connected supportive knowledge               
              "as needed," 3) the integrative aspects of the engineering process,            
              and 4) instructional technologies.  Representing a diversity of                
              institutional cultures imbedded in regions of significant                      
              underrepresented minorities population, the Coalition will impact              
              engineering education through structure, content, and                          
              interinstitutional linkages.  The program will emphasize engaging              
              students in engineering from the day they matriculate; making the              
              study of engineering more attractive, exciting and fulfilling;                 
              developing students as emerging professional leaders with the                  
              knowledge base and capability for lifelong learning; increasing the            
              the numbers of women, underrepresented minorities and the disabled             
              participating in engineering; and drawing engineering faculty to               
              a dedicated investment in the teaching of undergraduate students.
