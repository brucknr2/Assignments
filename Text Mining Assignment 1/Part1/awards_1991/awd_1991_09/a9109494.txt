Abstract    :
                    This research will study the movement to abolish the death               
              penalty in the United States.  The award is made to an investigator            
              at an undergraduate institution (RUI award).  The project will                 
              trace the activities of selected anti-death penalty movement                   
              organizations from 1972 to the present.  The study will examine how            
              the organizations' ability to mobilize and recruit members depend              
              on their organizational infrastructure, on the resources they are              
              able to marshall, and on the political climate.  The investigator              
              will examine organizational records, and perform interviews with               
              members active in the organizations.                                           
                    This research will make an important contribution to the                 
              study of social movements.  It will also provide important insights            
              into the organizational strategies and dilemmas the anti-death                 
              penalty organizations have developed in response to widespread                 
              hostility to their cause and difficulties in maintaining the                   
              commitment of their members.
