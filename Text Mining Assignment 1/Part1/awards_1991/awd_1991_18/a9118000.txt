Abstract    :
                   Cretaceous (Campanian) depositional sequences in the Mesaverde            
              escarpment of the southern Big Horn Basin (Wyoming) appear to have             
              been deposited at 100,000 year intervals.  Studies of several                  
              sections suggest that despite their high frequency nature, the                 
              sequences contain elements of sequence architecture, including                 
              transgressive surfaces (ravinements), flooding surfaces, thin                  
              onlapping (transgressive) deposits, and downlapping (regressive)               
              deposits. This hypothesis will be investigated by 1) collecting                
              field data, 2) constraining numerical simulations against the field            
              data, and 3) returning to the field to check model predictions                 
              against the field evidence.  In step 1, strata thicknesses and                 
              grain sizes in these sequences will be measured along a series of              
              30 meter sections along shore-normal and shore-parallel transects.             
              In step 2, the data will be used to modify and extend existing                 
              numerical models for facies and sequence formation.  Existing                  
              techniques for 1-D forward modeling of stratal successions will be             
              extended.  Depositional systems (lithofacies assemblages) will be              
              simulated in 2 dimensions by "chaining" 1-D synthetic stratigraphic            
              columns.  Cyclic sedimentation ("parasequence stacking") will be               
              simulated by varying basin parameters such as water depth and                  
              sedimentation rate.  In step 3, predictions of the models will be              
              compared against further field studies.
