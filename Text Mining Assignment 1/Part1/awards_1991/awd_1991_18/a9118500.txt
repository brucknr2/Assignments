Abstract    :
              This project is to analyze gamma ray and x-ray data which were                 
              obtained on a long duration balloon flight from McMurdo, Antarctica            
              in December 1990.  The data include gamma rays produced by a solar             
              flare, background radiation (mostly from aurora) and possibly gamma            
              rays from the supernova, SN1987.  The flight was longer than any               
              prior high altitude flight for a large (approximately 1500 Kg)                 
              payload.  It lasted for 9 days and circumnavigated the south pole.             
                                                                                             
              The balloon flight was jointly supported by NSF's Division of Polar            
              Programs and NASA's Suborbital Program.
