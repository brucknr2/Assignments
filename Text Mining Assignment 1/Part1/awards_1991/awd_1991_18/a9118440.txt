Abstract    :
              Pangrle         This research is focused on two problems of high level 
              synthesis, control and datapath synthesis, and how the tradeoffs  between the
              two affect layout and performance of VLSI designs.   First is  finding
              control/datapath tradeoffs based on high-level  transformations performed on
              the control/data flow graph.  Second  is incorporation of layout considerations
              into the generation of  the datapath connectivity.  A new data path generation
              scheme  that aims at producing datapaths with better performance and  layout
              characteristics is being developed.  This research is  being performed within
              the basic framework of the Keystone System  which automatically synthesizes and
              simulates all of the datapath  components, the control logic, and the routing.
