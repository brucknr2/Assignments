Abstract    :
                This research is to determine the kinematics of relative motion              
              within deforming Central and East Asia using a new method.  By                 
              fitting a polynomial function to observed, average blocks of                   
              strain rate, the analysis can determine both relative velocities               
              and rotations within specified reference frames.  Strain rates                 
              are determined from a moment tensor summation of large                         
              earthquakes in this century, and from Quaternary slip rates on                 
              major faults.  This method allows scientists to directly relate                
              the often complicated styles of faulting over broad regions of                 
              continental deformation to the relative motion of the plates.                  
              Importantly, it also allows the investigation of the  role the                 
              faults are playing in accommodating that relative motion.  This                
              research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard                      
              Reduction Program.
