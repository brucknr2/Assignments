Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project supports research conducted by Dr. Rozeanne Steckler,             
              a research scientist, at the San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC)             
              Advances in electronic structure software and in computer hardware             
              have made the calculations of energetics of experimentally                     
              interesting chemical systems a reality.  Dr. Steckler will work on             
              the development of a software program called CADRATE, which will               
              be an integration of CADPAC3 and POLYRATE4. THis effort will also              
              include the development of a better user interface to POLYRATE.                
              THe results of this project will further enable chemists of all                
              disciples to use the power of the supercomputer to model chemical              
              reactions being studied in the laboratory.
