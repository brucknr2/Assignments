Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The primary objective of this project is to determine the                 
              thermal history of the Newark Basin via fission-track and 40Ar/39Ar            
              analysis of sediment core from the Newark Basin Scientific Drilling            
              Project and surface samples together with some geophysical modeling            
              of the basin evolution.  The principal investigators will undertake            
              about 75 fission-track analyses consisting of both surface and                 
              subsurface samples.  The vertical sections provided by the wells               
              will provide geothermal gradient restraints and data from the                  
              intermediate age rift sediments whose outcrop distribution is poor.            
                                                                                             
              The surface samples will densify the regional age distribution and             
              detail the recharge zone for hydrothermal circulation identified               
              along the border fault by their earlier work.  In addition to the              
              fission-track analyses, approximately a dozen samples will be                  
              subjected to 40Ar/39Ar analysis.  These samples will include Newark            
              Basin clastics (surface and subsurface), granophyres from the                  
              Palisades Sill, and basement rocks adjacent to the Newark Basin.               
              These will provide a higher-temperature framework with which to                
              evaluate the fission-track data.                                               
                                                                                             
                   In order to decipher the fission-track data, the principal                
              investigators will numerically model the apatite age and track                 
              length distributions to invert for the temperature history of each             
              sample.  These estimates of the cooling history will be combined               
              to determine the low temperature thermal evolution of the Newark               
              Basin.  The zircon and sphene fission-track ages will help to                  
              constrain the higher temperature thermal history.
