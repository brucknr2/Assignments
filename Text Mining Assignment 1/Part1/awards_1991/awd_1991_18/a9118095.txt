Abstract    :
                   This award will provide for half the funds needed to acquire              
              an X-ray diffractometer. The additional funding to make this                   
              acquisition possible has been committed by the University. The                 
              modern automated diffractometer requested will replace old,unsafe              
              instrumentation. The equipment will aid research programs of twelve            
              faculty members and their students. It will also be used in the                
              teaching of undergraduate and graduate courses in                              
              mineralogy,petrology,and geochemistry.
