Abstract    :
              The aim of the proposal is to isolate and characterize the                     
              inhibitor(s) of tuna skeletal adenylate kinase (AK) found in                   
              mammalian normal sera.  Sera from cat, goat, guinea pig, and human             
              have been tested and each is able to inhibit tuna skeletal muscle              
              AK.  AK from skeletal muscle of terrestial mammals is not                      
              inhibited. Isolation of the inhibitor will permit characterization             
              of its interaction with AKs.  This information will permit further             
              research on possible endogenous regulators which may suggest                   
              approaches to design of AK inhibitors.  Future research will                   
              involve conformation and binding studies on purified tuna AK and               
              isolated serum inhibitor.  The potential role of this inhibitor as             
              an endogenous AK regulator will be assessed.
