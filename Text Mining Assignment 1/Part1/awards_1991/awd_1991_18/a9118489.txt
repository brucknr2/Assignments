Abstract    :
              This award supports two marine geological cruises to the fjords                
              and continental shelf of southern Chile.  Research will                        
              concentrate on the collection and analysis of single channel                   
              seismic reflection data, 3.5 KHz profiler data, and piston cores.              
              This work will examine fundamental questions concerning the                    
              dynamics of the Patagonian ice sheet during the late Wisconsin                 
              glaciation and how it responded to changing marine and                         
              terrestrial climate during the last glacial/interglacial                       
              transition.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              This project represents an extension of current investigations                 
              into the marine geology of the Antarctic Peninsula to include                  
              glacial marine environments from a wider latitudinal range.  In                
              order to enhance the applicability of litho-and                                
              seismo-stratigraphic studies to a broader range of Quaternary                  
              science, this research will be conducted in cooperation with                   
              other researchers investigating marine and terrestrial                         
              paleoclimate.   Down core changes in micro-flora (diatoms) and                 
              micro-fauna will be examined in conjunction with geochemical and               
              isotopic analyses.  Palynological studies of some cores will be                
              undertaken in an attempt to refine our misunderstanding of the                 
              relationship between terrestrial and marine paleoclimates.  The                
              project will also be undertaken in cooperation with Chilean                    
              researchers who are interested in the sedimentary and tectonic                 
              history of the region.  By extending the marine studies of the                 
              Antarctic Peninsula to Patagonia, and by broadening their scope                
              to include land-sea correlations, valuable insight will be gained              
              into spatial and temporal changes on climate along a broad range               
              of latitudes.
