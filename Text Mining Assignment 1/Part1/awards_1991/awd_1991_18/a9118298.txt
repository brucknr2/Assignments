Abstract    :
                   This award provides 50 per cent funding for the acquisition               
              of a superconducting cryogenic 3-axis rock magnetometer to be                  
              installed and operated in the Paleomagnetics Laboratory at the                 
              Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory of Columbia University. The              
              University is committed to providing the remaining 50 per cent                 
              needed for the acquisition.                                                    
                   The new magnetometer will be used to analyze rock magnetism               
              in geological samples in research projects of the Principal                    
              Investigator and on-campus as well as off-campus collaborators.                
              Their research is aimed at documenting past records of geomagnetic             
              field vectors as a function of geologic time in order to understand            
              plate tectonic movements, the apparent wandering of the Earth's                
              magnetic poles, and the origins of the main dipole component of                
              the geomagnetic field.
