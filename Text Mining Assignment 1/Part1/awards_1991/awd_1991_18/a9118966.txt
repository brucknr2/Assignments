Abstract    :
                   Numerical models are key tools for research in atmospheric                
              science.  The wide range of temporal and spatial scales that are               
              involved in atmospheric motions presents a real challenge in terms             
              of how these different scales are handled in a numerical model.  An            
              essential element of a successful modeling effort, whether in a                
              research or an operational context, is the availability of                     
              computationally efficient numerical methods.  Multigrid methods                
              hold promise for overcoming of these numerical problems.                       
                   Under previous NSF support, Professor Fulton investigated                 
              applications of multigrid methodology to a variety of atmospheric              
              models.  He now plans to extend his previous results to other areas            
              and embark on some new applications.  Specifically, he will pursue             
              studies of (1) multigrid solvers for balanced models, (2) adaptive             
              mesh refinement in models of hurricanes and fronts, and (3)                    
              multigrid methodology for spectral models, both limited area and               
              global.
