Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The effects of genetics, environment, and aging all interact                   
              during the normal lifespan of an animal.  This exploratory                     
              project is the first attempt to study interactions among those                 
              three factors on a sensory system, hearing.  There is a unique                 
              opportunity to study auditory function in a group of several                   
              inbred and mutant mouse strains that are part of a study on diet               
              and longevity.  The auditory system will be tested non-invasively              
              during the normal lifespan of these animals, and tissues will be               
              preserved after death.  Relationships among physiology, anatomy,               
              genetics, diet and age will be evaluated by comparing data from                
              the various subject groups.  The data will provide new                         
              information about the roles of genetics and diet in maintaining                
              stability (homeostasis) or inducing change (plasticity) in the                 
              adult auditory system over extended periods of time.  There is a               
              large interdisciplinary potential impact of the results on                     
              auditory neuroscience, on sensory science in general, on mouse                 
              genetics and biology, and on development and aging research.
