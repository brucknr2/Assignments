Abstract    :
                   This project is dealing with the theory of current                        
              disruption and diversion during that is presented during                       
              substorms.  Collisionless tearing modes, which have been recently              
              shown to be linearly unstable with wavelengths of the order of a               
              By-field, are proposed as a possible candidate for current                     
              disruption and diversion.  It is shown that nonlinear mode-                    
              coupling effects enhance the growth rate of the mode by two                    
              orders of magnitude compared with the linear growth rate.  For                 
              parameters typical of the magnetotail, the current disruption is               
              predicted to occur on a timescale of 1-10 seconds.  Estimates are              
              given for the electric fields excited by the microturbulence, and              
              the resultant acceleration of electrons and protons.  Estimates                
              indicates ion energies up to 0.7 MeV and electron energies up to               
              8.1 MeV which are not inconsistent with observations.
