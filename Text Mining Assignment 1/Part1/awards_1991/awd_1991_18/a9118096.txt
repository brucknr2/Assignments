Abstract    :
                   This award provides funding for engineering design and                    
              construction of synchrotron X-ray beamlines and associated                     
              instrumentation that will be part of the Advanced Photon Source                
              (APS) facility at Argonne National Laboratory. This project will               
              be specifically aimed at the design and construction of beamlines              
              for use by the earth sciences community. Projected use of the                  
              brilliant and tunable microbeam hard X-radiation at APS include                
              research on materials subjected to ultra-high pressures and                    
              temperatures simulating conditions in the interior of the Earth,               
              aerosols, submicroscopic phases in rocks and soils, and kinetic                
              studies of phase transformations important in geological processes.
