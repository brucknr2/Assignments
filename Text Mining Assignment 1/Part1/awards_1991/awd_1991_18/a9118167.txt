Abstract    :
                   The Sierra Nevada batholith was emplaced in a Mesozoic                    
              continental arc setting in which oblique convergence should have               
              caused dextral transcurrent motion.  Such motion has been difficult            
              to demonstrate due to the level of exposure; however evidence for              
              such a fault having 400 km of displacement has recently been                   
              documented in a series of roof pendant preserved in the Sierra                 
              Nevada.  This project will map the candidate fault in the roof                 
              pendants and associated shear zones in the batholith in order to               
              constrain the kinematic history.  Samples will also be dated to put            
              temporal constraints on the movement.  Results are of considerable             
              significance in Mesozoic plate motions of the area and on the                  
              nature of intrabatholithic strike-slip faults.
