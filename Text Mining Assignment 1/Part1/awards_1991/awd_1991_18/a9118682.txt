Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Juvenile hormone (JH) controls the development of insects during               
              juvenile stages and also, in many species, egg development in the              
              adult females. In all insects JH secretion ceases at some time                 
              during the last larval stage thus permitting the insect to undergo             
              metamorphosis to the adult stage. JH secretion resumes shortly                 
              before or after the emergence of the adult and promotes egg                    
              maturation. The processes by which the reappearance of JH prior to             
              adult emergence is regulated are not known. The results of the                 
              proposed investigations will fill the gap in our knowledge about               
              this critical event in the life of insects.                                    
              The proposed studies will be done on the tobacco hornworm moth,                
              Manduca sexta. This insect is used as a model for many                         
              physiological, biochemical  and behavioral studies. We will examine            
              the changes in the biosynthesis of JH during metamorphosis with                
              standard biochemical methods, and investigate the neuroendocrine               
              basis for the reactivation of JH biosynthesis. These studies are               
              the first of this kind and will be of fundamental importance in the            
              field of developmental endocrinology. Since Manduca sexta belongs              
              to the order Lepidoptera, which includes some of the most                      
              destructive crop pests, the proposed studies may also have an                  
              important bearing on the development of new strategies for limiting            
              the reproductive  potential of pest species.
