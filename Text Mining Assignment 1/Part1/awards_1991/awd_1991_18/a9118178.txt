Abstract    :
                   This award will provide for half the funds needed to upgrade              
              the computer facilities that support research in the hydrogeology              
              laboratory at Johns Hopkins University. The additional funds                   
              necessary for this acquisition have been committed by the                      
              University. This upgrade will make it possible for the PI and his              
              students to pursue their latest generation of groundwater modelling            
              projects which require state-of-the-art computer processors, memory            
              and graphics capabilities.  This upgrade will allow the PI and his             
              students to pursue effectively research to be carried out under the            
              recently awarded grant (9117864).
