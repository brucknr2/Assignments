Abstract    :
                   Statistical decision theory attempts to provide a formal                  
              approach to decision making and statistical inference by asking                
              that explicit numerical criteria be given and that the merits of               
              a statistical procedure or decision be assessed by these                       
              criteria.  Since its introduction in the 1940's, decision theory               
              has served as a unifying force for apparently diverse branches of              
              statistics.  Its unifying nature is continually being                          
              rediscovered; for instance, a large body of recent work on                     
              function estimation has been found to be intimately related to                 
              classical minimax theory.  Decision theory has also provided the               
              basis for much of the foundational development in statistics.  It              
              also has a very practical side, and is increasingly being used in              
              the modeling and analysis of real decision problems in business,               
              economics, medicine, law, reliability and quality control, risk                
              assessment, and numerous other fields.                                         
                   This project will support the Fifth Purdue International                  
              Symposium on Statistical Decision Theory and Related Topics to be              
              held from June 14-20, 1992 at Purdue University.  The broad                    
              topics chosen for this symposium include classical subjects                    
              within or related to decision theory, such as                                  
              admissibility/minimaxity/invariance, sequential analysis,                      
              hierarchical and empirical Bayes analysis, multiple decision                   
              theory, optimal designs, and model selection.  Newer topics will               
              be included such as decision-theoretic function estimation,                    
              information/complexity, semiparametric models and adaptive                     
              methods, neural nets/influence diagrams/graphical structures,                  
              multiple prior/utility problems, computational Bayesian                        
              developments, and decision-theoretic aspects of noninformative                 
              priors, as well as a wide variety of applied problems in decision              
              theory.  Previous symposia in this series on decision theory and               
              related topics were held in 1961, 1970, 1976, 1981, and 1986.
