Abstract    :
                   The proposed research program will make major advances in the             
              understanding of the chemical and mineralogical record of the                  
              accretion of extraterrestrial matter to the Earth, as recorded in              
              terrestrial sediments.  In the next three years we propose research            
              into the mineralogy and geochemistry of debris from three distinct             
              impact events.  1) We will characterize the abundance,                         
              distribution, and composition of Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary                  
              impact debris in the Pacific Ocean basin.  This will approximately             
              double the portion of the Earth's surface studied in this way and              
              will probably result in the most definitive study to date of the               
              composition of this debris.  2) We will investigate the detailed               
              geochemistry of an early Archean (~3.4 Ga) spherule bed which marks            
              a major asteroid impact as well as a major change in the tectonic              
              evolution of the Barberton Greenstone Belt.  We will concentrate               
              on determining whether there is geochemical evidence to support the            
              hypothesis that gradations across the spherule bed reflect chemical            
              and thermal evolution of an impact-generated vapor cloud.  3) We               
              plan initial characterization of new sediments and debris recording            
              an asteroid impact into the subantarctic South Pacific during the              
              late Pliocene.  The sediments will be from piston cores that are               
              scheduled for sampling in Jan. 1994.//
