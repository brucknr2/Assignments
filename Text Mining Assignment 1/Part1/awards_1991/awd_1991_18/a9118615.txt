Abstract    :
                   This award will provide for half the funds necessary to                   
              acquire an automated carbonate preparation system which will be                
              attached to and integrated with an existing gas source isotope                 
              ratio mass spectrometer. The additional funds for this acquisition             
              have been committed by the University of Colorado. The equipment               
              will be used primarily by faculty and students in the Department               
              of Geological Sciences and the Institute of Arctic and Alpine                  
              Research(INSTAAR). The automated preparation system will make it               
              possible to increase greatly the number of samples that can be                 
              processed,thereby lowering costs per sample. Research projects to              
              be supported by this equipment cover a broad range of topics                   
              including paleoclimate studies,recent climate changes based on                 
              studies of corals,carbonate diagenesis,and Paleozoic                           
              paleooceanography.
