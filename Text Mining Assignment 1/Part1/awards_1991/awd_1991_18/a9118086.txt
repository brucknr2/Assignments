Abstract    :
                This research will concentrate on the orientation of stress in               
              south-central Alaska.  Stress tensors will be estimated by means               
              of analysis of fault plane solutions for large numbers of small                
              to medium magnitude earthquakes.  The Denali fault and the deep                
              subduction zone changes strike markedly in this area and one of                
              the questions to be addressed is how the stress changes relate to              
              the strike changes and depths of the faults.  These are                        
              fundamental questions that bear on the seismic hazard and                      
              tectonics of Alaska.  This research is a component of the                      
              National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
