Abstract    :
              Theory will be developed for the electronic and vibrational                    
              properties of metals, insulators and superconductors, especially               
              crystalline oxides such as copper-and bismuth-oxide superconductors            
              and vanadium-oxide based metal-insulator systems.  The underlying              
              motive is to explore the still obscure mechanism for high                      
              temperature superconductivity.  A secondary motive for the research            
              is to improve understanding of the diverse and poorly understood               
              electrical transport properties of these materials.  As a model                
              system barium-bismuth-oxide will be studied in detail.  The charge             
              carriers in this insulator are bipolarons.  A continuous evolution             
              through an exotic superconducting state to a normal metallic                   
              conductor occurs as bismuth is replaced by lead.  Polaron and                  
              bipolaron models will be developed and tested to model resistivity,            
              Hall coefficient, and superconductivity.  Other model systems to be            
              studied are niobium-oxide and vanadium-dioxide.  The latter has a              
              metal-insulator transition at a temperature convenient for device              
              applications such as memory elements.  The effect of lattice                   
              distortion and phonons on the transition will be studied.  Thermal             
              conduction will also be studied in a model of amorphous silicon.
