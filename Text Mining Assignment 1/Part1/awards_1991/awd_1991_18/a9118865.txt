Abstract    :
              This proposal is part of an integrated scientific                              
              investigation to study the properties of the Arctic Ocean,                     
              atmosphere, sea-ice and biology in the Northeast Water (NEW)                   
              Polynya, which occurs near northeastern Greenland, in order                    
              to gain an integrated understanding of Arctic shelf-slope                      
              processes.  This element of the NEW program will conduct                       
              numerical experiments with a three-dimensional ocean model.                    
              Numerical experiments will help guide planning for                             
              initiating field research and hydrographic surveys.  Data                      
              gathered during the first field season will be used to                         
              validate the model.  When model and observed currents are in                   
              agreement, the model will begin to integrate the physical                      
              and biological components to evaluate heat and carbon                          
              budgets associated with the polynya.
