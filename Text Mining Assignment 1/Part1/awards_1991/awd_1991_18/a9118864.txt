Abstract    :
              This research project is an interdisciplinary study to identify and            
              to quantify biological chemicals that affect ecological                        
              relationships among benthic antarctic marine invertebrates.  This              
              research is a continuation of a program that succeeded in                      
              documenting a moderate incidence of chemical influence on                      
              ecological relationships in polar communities, contrary to                     
              contemporary theory that suggests an inverse relationship between              
              latitude and incidence of chemical defense.  This project extends              
              the scope of that earlier study by addressing the chemical nature              
              of defensive agents.  The objectives are to isolate and to                     
              characterize biologically active chemicals from previously                     
              identified invertebrates with chemical defense mechanisms.  The                
              goals are to evaluate the role of these chemicals as feeding                   
              deterrents, anti-fouling agents or overgrowth inhibitory chemicals,            
              to determine the biological origin of these chemical metabolites,              
              and to examine the storage of defensive agents in specific tissues             
              or mucus.  Ecologically significant bioassays will guide the                   
              analytical isolation and characterization of identified defense                
              metabolites.  The proposed research will enhance our understanding             
              and significance of defense metabolites in the ecology of antarctic            
              marine benthos, a changing paradigm.
