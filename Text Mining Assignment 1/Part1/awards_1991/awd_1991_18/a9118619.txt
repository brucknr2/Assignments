Abstract    :
                   The transition in failure mechanism from brittle fracture to              
              plastic flow is important in understanding tectonophysics, the                 
              strength of the crust, and the style of deformation at the field               
              scale.  Recent studies in three areas have yielded new insight into            
              the physics and mechanics of the brittle-plastic transition:                   
              acquisition of high quality mechanical data, systematic                        
              observations of deformation microstructures, and advances in the               
              theoretical modeling of the failure of rocks in compression.                   
              Qualitative microstructural observations have provided information             
              on the conditions under which various deformation mechanism                    
              operate, estimates of strain partitioning, and identification of               
              crack nucleation mechanism.  The PI will continue work on the                  
              brittle-ductile transition by performing triaxial mechanical tests             
              on natural and synthetic rocks of calcite, anorthite, peridotite,              
              and diabase.  Quantitative microstructural analyses to understand              
              the micromechanics of deformation are an  important part of this               
              study.  Acoustic emission measurements will also be performed on               
              a selected number of experiments, and axial and volumetric strain              
              measurements will be made during the tests.
