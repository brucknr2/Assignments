Abstract    :
              This project is an investigation of the factors that influence the             
              insertion of membrane proteins into membranes.  Three areas of                 
              interest are being pursued.  First, the alkaline phosphatase (AP)              
              fusion technique is being applied to determine the topology of the             
              E. coli MalG protein.  The topology of a membrane protein is a                 
              description specifying which parts are on which side of the                    
              membrane and which parts lie within the membrane.  The AP protein              
              fusion method for studying topology is based of the inactivity of              
              cytoplasmically localized AP.  Since AP behaves as if it were part             
              of the membrane protein in fusions, its activity indicates which               
              side of the membrane it is on.  Second, a further analysis of                  
              cytoplasmic localization signals in the E. coli integral membrane              
              protein, MalF, is being carried out.  Third a preliminary study                
              designed to determine whether or not there is a cellular machinery             
              that inserts membrane proteins into membranes and determines their             
              orientation will be initiated.
