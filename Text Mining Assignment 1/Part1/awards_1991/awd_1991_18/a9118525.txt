Abstract    :
                This research is to develop and test methods for resolving the               
              fault plane ambiguity problem, that is, the inability of fault                 
              plane solutions from first motions of an earthquake to resolve                 
              which of two orthogonal planes was the actual fault surface.  The              
              research will be done using locally recorded, broad-band, high                 
              dynamic range digital seismograms from the Anza, California,                   
              digital seismic array for the Cahuilla earthquake swarm.  The                  
              broad-band seismic energy of the complete body waves should have               
              some directivity information as a result of the finite source                  
              size.  Data from portable seismic systems that recorded                        
              earthquake swarms between the Elsinore and San Jacinto fault                   
              zones will also be analyzed.  This research is a component of the              
              National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
