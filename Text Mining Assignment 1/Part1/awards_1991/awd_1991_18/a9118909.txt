Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              One of the most formidable problems in neural development is to                
              understand how the regulation of the fate of the small number of               
              cells of a developing embryo translates in the adult nervous system            
              to a large number and the wide diversity of cell types.  The well              
              documented genetics and molecular biology of the fruit fly,                    
              Drosophila melanogaster, make the fruit fly an excellent model                 
              system for the study of the role of specific genes and their                   
              regulation of expression in the adult animal.  The runt gene has               
              been shown to have diverse roles in the development of the fruit               
              fly and recently has been shown to effect specific identifiable                
              neurons developing from specific subsets of neuroblasts.  Hybrids              
              of the runt gene will be used determine the role of the native gene            
              in determining the fate of specific neuroblast cells in early                  
              development.  The structure of nuclear regulatory protein generated            
              by the runt gene and its hybrids will be used to determine the                 
              structurally significant part of the protein from a functional                 
              perspective.  Information from these studies will be used to                   
              evaluate the extent of preservation of this function in higher                 
              species and the generalization of gene regulatory processes through            
              the animal kingdom.
