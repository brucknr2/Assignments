Abstract    :
              The dynamics of very large DNA molecules undergoing gel                        
              electrophoresis will be studied using a fluorescence microscope                
              developed under a previous NSF grant.  The objectives of this                  
              study are:                                                                     
              (l) to characterize DNA motion in steady and pulsed fields;                    
              (2) to determine the molecular processes involved in the trapping              
                  of these large molecules in the gel;                                       
              (3) to test for the existence of "lakes" and "super-lakes" in                  
                  agarose gels; and                                                          
              (4) to improve the computer model of DNA electrophoresis.                      
              Understanding the dynamics of megabase DNA electrophoresis may                 
              lead to improvements in this technique which is vital to gene                  
              mapping studies.                                                               
                                                                                             
              The elastic and torsional properties of single DNA molecules will              
              also be studied by attaching them at one end to paramagnetic                   
              beads and at the other end to a microscope slide.  The bead will               
              be subjected to a magnetic field.  A characterization of these                 
              basic properties of DNA is necessary for an understanding of the               
              behaviour of these molecules in their natural milieu.
