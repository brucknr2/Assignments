Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              High resolution dental casts can be used to document the pattern of            
              dental microwear in museum specimens.  The primary objective of                
              this proposal is to document not only the pattern of wear, but its             
              changes and rates over time in a live primate in the wild.                     
                                                                                             
              Populations of a New World monkey, Alouatta palliata, which have               
              been subject to behavioral observation for an extended period will             
              be trapped and dental impressions taken.  The resulting casts will             
              be studied via scanning electronmicroscope for wear patterns and               
              tooth morphology.   Each animal will be re-cast several times                  
              during the course of the study, allowing for analysis of intra-                
              individual change as a function of changing diet.  This work will              
              allow new insights into the association between diet and toothwear.
