Abstract    :
                   This collaborative project will study the structural and                  
              stratigraphic evolution of the Pliocene-Quaternary Loreto Basin,               
              which lies along the margin of the Gulf of California in Baja                  
              California Sur.  A transform-rift system beginning at 5Ma formed               
              the Loreto and related basins but they have not been studied in                
              detail until now, despite good exposure and accessibility.                     
              Magnetostratigraphy will be combined with radiometric dating of                
              four tuffs and paleontological data of other workers to give good              
              chronostratigraphic control of the basin's evolution.  These data              
              will permit investigation of the role of growth structures on the              
              stratigraphic geometries in the basin.  The results will resolve               
              major outstanding problems in the tectonics of the Gulf of                     
              California, and will have important implications for the tectonics             
              of obliquely-rifted margins in general.
