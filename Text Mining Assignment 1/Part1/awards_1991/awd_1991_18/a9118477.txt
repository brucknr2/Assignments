Abstract    :
              In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the                       
              Chemistry Division, Marsha Lester of the University of                         
              Pennsylvania will use various spectroscopic techniques to                      
              characterize the intermolecular potentials of van der Waals                    
              molecules.  Stimulated emission pumping and other laser-based                  
              techniques will be used to probe highly excited energy levels                  
              of these complexes in order to obtain a fuller experimental                    
              description of the potential energy surface describing                         
              interacting species.  The spectroscopy of complexes containing                 
              an open-shell molecule will also be studied for information                    
              about collisional processes involving free radicals.

              Cluster molecules are the intermediate species formed when                     
              gaseous molecules condense to form liquids or solids.  The                     
              study of the structure and properties of clusters is useful in                 
              understanding such diverse phenomena as the processes involved                 
              in chemically reactive molecular encounters, protein folding,                  
              or catalytic activity on surfaces.  This project aims at more                  
              fully characterizing the forces which govern these sorts of                    
              chemical and physical processes.
