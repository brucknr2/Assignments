Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The primary objective of this Dissertation Improvement award is to             
              analyze reproductive strategies in a species of Malagasy                       
              prosimians, Propithecus diadema.   The student will investigate the            
              relationship between sex differences in feeding behavior,                      
              reproductive condition and environmental seasonality and female                
              access to food.  Sex differences in these behaviors are                        
              particularly interesting as the Malagasy lemurs, unlike most other             
              primates evidence female feeding priority and female dominance over            
              males.  This research will provide the first tests of hypotheses               
              concerning sex differences in feeding behavior in a forest dwelling            
              lemur.
