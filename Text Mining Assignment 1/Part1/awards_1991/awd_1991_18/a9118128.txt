Abstract    :
              The purpose of this research is to undertake a detailed geochemical            
              examination of megacrysts suites from the Malaitan alnoite (Solomon            
              Islands), and the Sloan-Nix kimberlite (Colorado).  Samples will               
              be gathered from existing collections and initially characterized              
              by EMP analysis.  Fractionation trends thus defined will allow                 
              critical samples to be selected for IMP analysis.  Traverses will              
              be carried out on samples forming end-member compositions to the               
              apparent fractionation trends defined by EMP analyses.  This                   
              approach will then pin-point samples for isotopic analysis (Sr, Nd,            
              Pb, O), using micro-sampling techniques to investigate potential               
              isotopic zonation within and between megacrysts.  This integrated              
              approach is required to:  1) determine the nature of the parental              
              magma; 2) evaluate the mode of crystallization within the mantle               
              regime; 3) determine whether the proposed igneous fractionation                
              occurred in an open- or closed-system environment; 4) establish any            
              link between megacryst crystallization and metasomatic processes;              
              and 5) examine the relationship (if any) between Cr-rich and Cr-               
              poor megacrysts.
