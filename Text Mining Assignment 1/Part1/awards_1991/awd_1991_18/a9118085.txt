Abstract    :
              The research described here is to develop theories for aqueous                 
              solvation of proteins.  Simple continuum solvent models are                    
              insufficient to describe phenomena such as hydrogen-bonding,                   
              orientation of water dipoles, and interactions involving                       
              separations of only a few water layers.  The three main                        
              objectives of this project are to develop analytic molecular                   
              theories of solvation, to use these theories to develop new methods            
              for treating solvent effects in molecular dynamics simulations, and            
              to study the solvation of a specific protein, rubredoxin.  While               
              the straightforward approach is to include water molecules in                  
              computer simulations of proteins, this becomes impractical as the              
              size or number of proteins and other molecules increases.  The                 
              approach here is to employ integral equation theories which predict            
              the molecular structure of liquids but with much less computation              
              than simulation methods.  These theories can be used to calculate              
              the net forces on the protein due to the solvent.

              Theories for solvent effects on macromolecules are crucial to                  
              developing theoretical methods to probe the structure, dynamics and            
              thermodynamics of biopolymers.  Specific, current problems for                 
              proteins to which these theories can be applied include folding,               
              enzyme-substrate binding, and electron-transfer in and between                 
              proteins.
