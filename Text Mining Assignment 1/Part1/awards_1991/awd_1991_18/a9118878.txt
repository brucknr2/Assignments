Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This is a Small Grants for Exploratory Research (SGER) award.             
              The proposed research will examine how families were affected by               
              the separation and subsequent reunion in connection with Operation             
              Desert Shield.  The investigators propose to use attachment theory             
              to predict individual differences in patterns of reacting to the               
              stresses of separation and in the ways of handling the experience              
              of reunion.  The investigators have secured access to the South                
              Carolina National Guard and Reserve Units allowing them to examine             
              systematically how deployment and subsequent reunion affects                   
              families.  The research design includes a baseline survey completed            
              during the period of separation as wells as two measurements during            
              the reunion period. The investigators have completed the baseline              
              survey of the spouses of 600 deployed and 290 non-deployed members             
              of the National Guard and Reserve Unites.  The follow up studies               
              are planned to take place 2-4 weeks after re-union, and                        
              approximately 6 months after reunion.                                          
                                                                                             
                   The proposed research provides a unique opportunity for                   
              examining the effects of war duty on the families that are left                
              behind.  In addition, the research promises to enhance our                     
              understanding of the ways in which different styles of attachment              
              influence the ways in which men and women deal with the absence of             
              their spouse and with the subsequent reunion.
