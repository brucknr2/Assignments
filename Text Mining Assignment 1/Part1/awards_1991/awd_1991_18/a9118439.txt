Abstract    :
              The annual advance and retreat of pack ice may be the major                    
              physical determinant of spatial/temporal changes in the structure              
              and function of antarctic marine communities.  Interannual cycles              
              and/or trends in the annual extent of pack ice may also have                   
              significant effects on all levels of the food web, from total                  
              annual primary production to breeding success in seabirds.                     
              Historical records indicate a 6 to 8 year cycle in the maximum                 
              extent of pack ice in the winter.  During this decade winters                  
              were colder in 1980 and 1981, and again in 1986 and 1987.  In                  
              order to understand the interactions between pack ice and                      
              ecosystem dynamics, especially the influences of the well-                     
              documented interannual variability in ice cover on representative              
              populations, a long-term ecological research (LTER) site has been              
              established in the Antarctic Peninsula region near Palmer                      
              Station.  The LTER project, will conduct comprehensive                         
              measurements of ice-dominated ecosystems in this region with a                 
              focus on primary production, krill populations and swarms and                  
              seabirds.  A primary emphasis will be placed on the development                
              of ecosystem models that will provide a predictive capability for              
              issues related to global environmental change.                                 
                                                                                             
              This proposal will add to the existing LTER project detailed                   
              studies of the biogeochemical cycling of carbon and associated                 
              bioelements.  The microbiology and carbon flux component of LTER               
              will provide measurements of a suite of core parameters relevant               
              to the carbon cycle and will test several hypotheses pertaining                
              to carbon flux, including bacterial productivity and nutrient                  
              regeneration.
