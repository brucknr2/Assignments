Abstract    :
              This project will integrate isotopic, whole-rock major and trace               
              element, and mineral chemistry data from basalts and xenoliths                 
              collected along a 500-km-long transect across the southern Baikal              
              Rift.  The transect extends from Proterozoic-Paleozoic lithosphere             
              in the southeast across the suture onto the Archean craton in the              
              northwest.  The Baikal Rift offers an excellent opportunity to test            
              two major hypotheses:  1) whether the spatial and temporal                     
              evolution of basalt geochemistry can be related to interaction of              
              asthenospheric derived melts and contrasting lithospheric columns              
              across the strike of the rift.  2) Is the unradiogenic Pb isotopic             
              character of the basalts related to an unradiogenic sub-Asian OIB              
              mantle source (Allegre et al., 1987) or to widespread crustal                  
              contamination.  The project is an outgrowth of the U.S.-U.S.S.R                
              comparative rift workshop on the Rio Grande and Baikal rifts                   
              sponsored jointly by the U.S. National Academy of Sciences and the             
              Academy of Sciences of the U.S.S.R.  It will involve field work as             
              well as extensive chemical analyses to be done at MIT.
