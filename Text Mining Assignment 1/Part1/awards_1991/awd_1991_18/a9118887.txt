Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Complex Carbohydrate Structure Database (CCSD), an IBM PC-                 
              compatible computerized database, and CarbBank, the database                   
              management system were created to provide structure and citation               
              information system to meet the needs of persons interested in                  
              complex carbohydrates.  CCSD and CarbBank, which were initiated                
              by an international body of carbohydrate scientists, have been in              
              development since 1986 and have been commercially available since              
              1989.  We propose to continue developing CarbBank-associated                   
              software, to continue building the CCSD, and to make this                      
              software available as part of larger database efforts                          
              administered by the National Center for Biotechnology Information              
              (NCBI) and by Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS).  We intend to                  
              create a completely open format for the CCSD and portable, well-               
              documented program modules that will ultimately be available to                
              academic and commercial groups interested in creating computer                 
              programs that access CCSD data.  The CCSD and CarbBank will also               
              be made compatible with several additional computer environments.              
              The CCSD is expected to grow from its present 3,888 records to                 
              over 20,000 records.  It is our goal to ensure that CarbBank                   
              plays a key role in managing carbohydrate structure information                
              in the global biotechnology arena.
