Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal plans to produce ceramic matrix composites through               
              the directed oxidation of alloys, and aims to examine the rate                 
              phenomena and the mechanisms of the composite growth through a                 
              systematic investigation of the oxidation rates of alloys with                 
              controlled amounts of dopants.  Wetting and composite-alloy                    
              interfacial surface energetics will be examined.  Conductivity and             
              Seebeck voltage measurements will be made.                                     
              %%%%                                                                           
              This proposed research will provide scientific foundations to the              
              recently developed so-called Lanxide process in which ceramics are             
              synthesized by the direct oxidation of metals.  The growth of                  
              several new ternary and quaternary ceramic matrix composites under             
              controlled laboratory conditions will be made.
