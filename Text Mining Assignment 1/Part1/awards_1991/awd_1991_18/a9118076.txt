Abstract    :
              The purpose of this research is to determine the time and duration             
              of flood basalt volcanism in the Siberian Traps.  Subaerial picrite            
              and basalt flows and pyroclastic rocks erupted about the time of               
              the boundary between the Permian and Triassic periods.  Basaltic               
              rocks will be dated precisely and accurately using the 40Ar-39Ar.              
              Forty basaltic samples have been supplied by Russian colleagues.               
              Samples come from a wide geographic area and from drill cores                  
              penetrating the thickest section of the lava sequence. Some                    
              Triassic rocks from Wrangellia terrane will also be analyzed.                  
              Radiometric dating will establish the age and duration of the                  
              volcanism, and has the potential of sheding light on the causes of             
              the Permo-Triassic extinction.
