Abstract    :
              The objective of this research is to employ polymer-producing                  
              bacteria under an in-situ environment to a soil of inferior                    
              strength so that the biopolymers released can serve as a binder in             
              soil particles to enhance the soil strength.  The goal is to                   
              provide a cost-effective, environmentally-acceptable, in-place                 
              method to increase the strength of the soil matrix.  It could also             
              be possible that this technology can be extended to minimize risks             
              associated with land subsidence due to fossil energy exploitation.
