Abstract    :
                   The proposed research tests the Muller's ratchet hypothesis               
              which concerns the evolution of dimorphic sex chromosomes.  The                
              distinctive organization of the X and Y sex chromosomes is                     
              responsible for sex-specific differences in the expression of                  
              many forms of hereditary disease.  The X sex chromosome also                   
              appears to play a particularly important role in the process of                
              adaptation, due to: 1) an enhanced level of expression of                      
              recessive, beneficial mutations, and 2) a form of sex specific                 
              gene expression for traits associated with sexual dimorphism.                  
                   The proposed research will extend previous work which has                 
              demonstrated that the Muller's ratchet process can be effectively              
              studied in the laboratory using a Drosophila melanogaster (common              
              fruit fly) model system.  The factors that affect the operation                
              of the Muller's ratchet process are:  mutation, selection,                     
              sampling error, and recombination.  These factors also determine               
              the size of the reservoir of disease-causing mutation that are                 
              maintained in human and other populations.  The proposed research              
              will permit us to better understand the dynamics of our own                    
              reservoir of deleterious mutations.                                            
                   The research used a D. melanogaster model system to                       
              study the rate of operation of the Muller's ratchet process in                 
              response to manipulative changes in its major parameters; the                  
              effective population size, and the presence/absence of                         
              recombination.  This is accomplished by constructing giant                     
              chromosomes that are forced to segregate like either a primitive               
              X (recombining) or Y (non-recombining) sex chromosomes and then                
              measuring the rate of accumulation of deleterious mutations.
