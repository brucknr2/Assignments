Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This project will convert the series of public use samples                
              into a single coherent form, facilitating the use of these data                
              for the study of long-term social change in American society.                  
              Large individual-level samples of the U.S. census of population                
              covering the census years 1880, 1900, 1910, 1940, 1950, 1960,                  
              1970, 1980, and 1990 are currently available or in preparation.                
              These data have proven to be a valuable resource, since they                   
              allow researchers to make analyses tailored to their specific                  
              research questions and to avoid the problems and limitations                   
              associated with using the published census data for different                  
              years.  The availability of these census files has led to some                 
              research on the nature of long-term social change in the United                
              States.  However, because the data files were created at                       
              different times and by different investigators, they have                      
              incompatible documentation and a wide variety of record layouts                
              and coding schemes.  These differences inhibit the use of the                  
              data for the study of social change.                                           
                   The preparation and documentation of an integrated Public                 
              Use Microdata Series will provide a valuable data resource for                 
              the research community, and will eventually contribute greatly to              
              our understanding of the changes American society has undergone                
              since 1880.
