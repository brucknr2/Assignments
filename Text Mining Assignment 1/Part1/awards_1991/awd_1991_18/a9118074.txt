Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The primary objective of this research is to study normal variation            
              in human ovarian function.  This will be undertaken through the                
              measurement of steroid hormones in healthy women living in the                 
              Cambridge Massachusetts area over a time course.  The primary,                 
              longitudinal data will consist of progesterone and estradiol                   
              levels, determined from salivary samples, for each female over an              
              extended time course.  A variety of steroid profiles are expected              
              to emerge and hazards-model analysis will be used to relate these              
              to various life events.  This research will make it possible to                
              assess the impact of normal variability in ovarian function on                 
              female fecundity and increase our understanding of human                       
              reproductive ecology.
