Abstract    :
              Ca2+ ion transport by the Ca2+-ATPase of sarcoplasmic reticulum is             
              a fundamental process in muscle physiology.  This enzyme removes               
              Ca2+ from the cytoplasm to storage sites in the sarcoplasmic                   
              reticulum resulting in muscle relaxation.  This project focusses               
              on electron crystallographic analysis of large multilayered                    
              crystalline arrays produced from detergent solubilized enzyme in               
              the presence of high Ca2+ concentrations.  The studies proposed                
              will 1.  develop methodology for obtaining and combining electron              
              diffraction image data from multilayered crystals of different                 
              thickness, 2.  optimize the protocols for preservation of 3-D                  
              order in the crystals for electron microscopic analysis, 3.                    
              investigate crystallization protocols that favor the production                
              of 2-D sheets free from stacking to facilitate the electron                    
              crystallographic analysis at higher resolution, and 4.  obtain                 
              information on protein secondary structure of the Ca2+-ATPase                  
              molecule by searching for characteristic diffraction from alpha                
              helices, beta sheets and lipid in X-ray diagrams of pelleted                   
              crystals.  Efforts will be made to carry this structure analysis               
              at least to the resolution of protein secondary structure                      
              (approximately 7A) to test current models of Ca2+-ATPase                       
              structure.
