Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The proposed work will lead to the characterization of cellulase               
              genes, cellulase proteins, and a test of their role in the                     
              infection of higher plants by the N2-fixing symbiont, Frankia.                 
                                                                                             
              Two endoglucanase genes have been isolated.  Additional genes will             
              be sought, and their molecular structure determined through DNA                
              sequencing, to identify any unique characteristics that enable                 
              functioning in symbiosis.  Endoglucanase proteins will be                      
              overexpressed in E. coli, or S. aureus, purified, and used to raise            
              antibodies for immunocytochemical localization during infection.               
              The results will allow conclusions to be drawn about molecular                 
              interactions that occur during infection and root nodule                       
              development in actinorhizal plants.  If gene replacement or                    
              disruption attempts are successful for eliminating endoglucanase               
              from Frankia, mutants will be tested for their ability to infect               
              and establish a symbiosis, and such mutants will be the first                  
              demonstration of genetic manipulation in these important organisms.            
                                                                                             
              In addition, novel cellulases will become available to be evaluated            
              for their practical development in biomass conversions.***//
