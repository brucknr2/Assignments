Abstract    :
                This study focuses primarily on the transcriptional regulation               
              of the G-protein alpha i2 subunit and potential feedback mechanisms            
              by which G proteins are themselves regulated.  Transient co-                   
              transfection assays demonstrate changes in transcription of several            
              different promoter-reporter genes when introduced into cells with              
              increasing amounts of plasmids directing the synthesis of specific             
              G protein subunits.  The combination of this co-transfection assay             
              with in vitro mutagenesis of alpha i2 promoter regions will aid                
              characterization and mapping of regions required for G protein                 
              dependent responses.  Such studies will permit the association of              
              new functions with specific G protein subunits and the distinction             
              between mechanisms affected by closely realted subunits.                       
                                                                                             
              GTP-binding (G) proteins are membrane-associated proteins that have            
              critical roles in regulating cellular responses to a variety of                
              external stimuli.  G protein-mediated cascades include the                     
              generation of cyclic AMP, activation of protein kinase C, and the              
              regulation of several ion channels.  These pathways impinge upon               
              other processes that ultimately can affect the functioning of                  
              transcription factors and the expression of numerous genes,                    
              including G proteins.  Multiple control mechanisms appear to be                
              operative in determining tissue specific aqnd differentiation-                 
              dependent expression of G proteins.  In addition, analysis of DNA              
              sequences from some of these genes reveals potential cAMP and                  
              phorbol ester responsive elements near the transcriptional control             
              signals.  Knowledge of how G protein pathways interact to influence            
              transcription will lead to a greater understanding of how signal               
              transduction mechanisms coordinate gene expression during cell                 
              growth and development.
