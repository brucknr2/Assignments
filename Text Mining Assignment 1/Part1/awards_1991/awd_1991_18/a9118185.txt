Abstract    :
              The goal of this research is to determine how local regions in DNA             
              undergo conformational transitions during specific interactions                
              with proteins.  Fluorescence and absorption spectroscopy will                  
              detect both local and global conformational changes.  The method               
              measures DNA which may be a minor component and senses                         
              conformational changes in both DNA and protein induced by complex              
              formation.  Dr. Norlund aims to determine:                                     
                   1.  Thermodynamics of DNA structural motions and binding in               
              the Eco                                                                        
              RI-DNA complex.                                                                
                   2.  Time-dependent conformation in the recognition sequence               
              duringcleavage.                                                                
                   3.  The binding constant of Eco RI to DNA using a direct                  
              fluorometric method.                                                           
                   4.  Contributions of ribose, base stacking and local charge to            
              fluorescence changes.                                                          
                   5.  Whether kinks exist in the Eco RI recognition sequence                
              before binding?                                                                
                   6.  Whether Eco RI interaction with GAA bases are stronger                
              than with TTC.                                                                 
                   7.  Whether melting "bubbles" form around less stable bases as            
              suggested?                                                                     
                   8.  Whether partially-stacked bases are first recognized by               
              the Eco RI Endonuclease.                                                       
                   9.  Amplitudes and rates of DNA base transient excursions.                
                   10.  Whether distribution models explain lifetimes better than            
              discrete exponentials.
