Abstract    :
                 The major objectives of this proposed research are to continue              
              basic investigations into the mechanism of signal-coupling during              
              the initiation of endocytosis in Amoeba proteus and to provide some            
              undergraduate students with a realistic research experience.                   
              Endocytosis is a fundamental process which involves the uptake of              
              material external to a cell by surface membrane infolding and                  
              vesiculation.  Previous work from this laboratory examined the                 
              interaction of signal molecules with the cell surface and                      
              identified several possible components of the signal pathway                   
              associated with the onset of endocytosis.  These include a G-                  
              protein, cyclic AMP and calcium.  A G-protein in the amoeba                    
              membrane was identified by ADP-ribosylation of a membrane                      
              protein(s) in the presence of cholera and pertussis toxin.                     
              Initiation of both phagocytosis and pinocytosis elicit rapid                   
              transient oscillations in cytoplasmic cAMP levels and cytoplasmic              
              Ca increases transiently in stimulated cells.                                  
                                                                                             
              This proposal will attempt to further characterizethe components               
              of the signal pathway and try to differentiate between the signal              
              processes occurring during both pinocytosis and phagocytosis.  The             
              ameba represents a particularly useful model system in the study               
              of endocytosis and it is expected that this study will increase our            
              insight into the mechanism of endocytosis in this and other                    
              systems.
