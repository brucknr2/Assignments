Abstract    :
              It is proposed to investigate an                                               
              approach to the controlled synthesis                                           
              of ultrafine particles of narrow                                               
              size distribution.  Particles are                                              
              nucleated during the rapid mixing of                                           
              microemulsion solutions containing                                             
              the two reagents, one in                                                       
              considerable excess.  The   particle                                           
              growth is controlled by the                                                    
              addition of the limiting reagent to                                            
              the microemulsion via dialysis in                                              
              a hollow fibre membrane module.                                                
              Then, the particles are dispersed in                                           
              thin glass films cast via                                                      
              spin-coating techniques, and                                                   
              recrystallized before densification                                            
              of the film.  Linear and nonlinear                                             
              optical techniques, and external                                               
              field dependent measurements are                                               
              used for optical characterization                                              
              of the quantum crystallites.  A                                                
              theoretical analysis of the                                                    
              transport and reaction processes in

              detailed population balance                                                    
              considerations will be carried out.                                            
              Models for the recrystallization of                                            
              the particles, both during

              expected that the project will  lead                                           
              to the development of new
