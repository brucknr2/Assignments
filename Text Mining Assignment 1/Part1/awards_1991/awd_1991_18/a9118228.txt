Abstract    :
                   Both natural climate and ecosystems may respond abruptly to               
              gradual forcings.  During the late glacial time window between                 
              14,000 and 10,000 years BP, large magnitude changes occurred within            
              decades.  This project will examine the records from integrated                
              close-interval samples of two different climate proxies with                   
              different response rates in the climatically sensitive Midwest                 
              region south of the Great Lakes.  We will use stable isotopes                  
              present in lake sediment carbonates as a proxy measure of almost               
              instantaneous response to changes in regional precipitation                    
              patterns.  We will use pollen deposition as a proxy for regional               
              vegetation (and indirectly climate), giving a record with a time               
              lag.  The area including Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, and Illinois will            
              be examined.  These sites will allow direct comparison of response             
              rate of different systems during the two warming events in the late            
              glacial around 13,000 BP, and in the Younger Dryas Chron around                
              10,200 BP.
