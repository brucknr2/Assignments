Abstract    :
              Iron-sulfur (Fe:S) centers in proteins exhibit a diverse range of              
              structures and functional properties.  X-ray diffraction methods               
              will be used to determine the three-dimensional structures of three            
              Fe:S proteins involved in electron transfer reactions: the                     
              nitrogenase molybdenum-iron protein from Azotobacter vinelandii and            
              the rubredoxin and ferredoxin from the hyperthermophile Pyrococcus             
              furiosis.  The crystallographic structures will permit an                      
              evaluation of the roles of the polypeptide and iron-sulfur centers             
              in controlling the redox properties and electron transfer                      
              mechanisms of these proteins.  The specific structural objectives              
              of this proposal are:                                                          
                                                                                             
              Nitrogenase molybdenum-iron protein.  The molybdenum iron (MoFe-)              
              protein component of nitrogenase contains the site of substrate                
              reduction, an iron-sulfur-molybdenum cofactor of presently unknown             
              structure.  The functional roles of the clusters and protein will              
              be addressed by crystallographic studies to at least 2.5A                      
              resolution of the A. vinelandii MoFe-protein in the presence and               
              absence of bound ligands (inhibitor and nucleotides) and in                    
              different oxidation states: mutant MoFe-proteins; and structures of            
              alternative nitrogenase proteins related to MoFe-protein.                      
                                                                                             
              Thermostable rubredoxin and ferredoxin.  The archaebacterium                   
              Pyrococcus furiosis is a hyperthermophile that grows at 1000C.                 
              Crystallographic structures of the rubredoxin (refined to at least             
              0.96A resolution) and ferredoxin from this organism will not only              
              define the details of the protein-Fe:S center interactions, but                
              will also provide a structural framework for characterizing the                
              thermostability of these proteins.
