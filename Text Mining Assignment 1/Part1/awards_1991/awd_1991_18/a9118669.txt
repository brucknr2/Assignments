Abstract    :
              At the end of the Paleozoic, the western margin of North America               
              changed from passive to convergent, and lower Paleozoic sedimentary            
              rocks in the Great Basin were remagnetized from S. Nevada to west-             
              central Utah.  In northern Nevada, remagnetization did not occur               
              until the Triassic.  This study will test if the different timings             
              of remagnetization were the result of different docking times of               
              terranes onto the western North American Margin.  The stratigraphic            
              and areal extent and the timing of remagnetization will be                     
              determined for each carbonate sequence and it will be determined               
              if the remagnetization was normal or chemical.  The remagnetization            
              will then be related to known regional tectonic events.  The                   
              results of this study will provide important information about                 
              remagnetization processes and will have direct bearing on tectonic             
              reconstructions of western North America during the late Paleozoic
