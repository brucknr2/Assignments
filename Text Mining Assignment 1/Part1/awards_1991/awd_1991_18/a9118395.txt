Abstract    :
                   It is well established that rock at depth can deform in either            
              (or both) a ductile or brittle fashion in response to the passage              
              of a more fluid material (magma, water, salt, etc.).  Empirically,             
              the greater the viscosity contrast between the host rock and the               
              fluid moving around, the more likely one is to find the fluid in               
              narrow cracks and dikes, and the less likely one is to find it in              
              diapirs and plutions.  Although this observation is intuitively                
              appealing, as yet there has been little effort to quantify the role            
              of host/fluid viscosity contrast in determining the geologic                   
              regimes under which dike intrusion is likely or possible.  The PI              
              will study the dike/diapir transition be treading dikes as                     
              propagating, fluid-filled cracks in viscoelastic host rock.  The               
              results, in addition to being of general geologic interest, should             
              find particular application to a number of important questions and             
              processes.  These include the buoyant rise of granitic and                     
              serpentinite bodies along faults, the question of whether                      
              pluton/crustal viscosity contrasts are such that granities can                 
              ascend via a combination of fracture and flow, at rates greater                
              than that of the Stoke's flow solution ( and hence traverse more               
              of the crust before freezing), and the upwelling of buoyant                    
              asthenosphere between diverging (rifting) lithospheric blocks.
