Abstract    :
              Diadenosine 5'5"-PI,P4-tetraphosphate (Ap4A), a dinucleoside                   
              polyphosphate present in all organisms examined including humans,              
              has several properties expected of a regulatory nucleotide. Ap4A               
              has been proposed to function in cell proliferation and the                    
              adaptive response to oxidative stress.  The major goal is to                   
              determine the function(s) of Ap4A in the yeast, Saccharomyces                  
              cerevisiae, during growth, starvation-induced arrest and the                   
              cellular response to oxidative stress.  The processes that will be             
              examined are growth under different conditions including catabolite            
              repression, arrest of cell growth by deprivation of specific                   
              nutrients, and cellular responses to oxidative stress induced by               
              several agents and conditions.
