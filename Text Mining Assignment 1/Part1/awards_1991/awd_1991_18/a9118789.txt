Abstract    :
              The Posterior Sex Comb (Psc) gene of Drosophila is a pleiotropic               
              developmental regulatory gene.  As a member of the Polycomb group              
              of genes it is essential for the maintenance of segment specific               
              embryonic determination.  We have cloned and sequenced this gene               
              and found that it shares a 200 amino acid domain with the                      
              neighboring Suppressor Two of zeste (Su(z)2) gene and the recently             
              described murine bmi-1 oncogene.  Using immunostaining of polytene             
              chromosomes we have found that the Psc protein is a locus specific             
              chromosomal protein that is found at the location of a number of               
              expected target genes.  We will use this chromosome staining assay             
              and germ line transformation to map the target DNA sequences that              
              are responsible for the chromosomal binding site and we will                   
              determine if the Psc protein can directly bind to these sequences              
              in vitro.  We will attempt to determine the function of the protein            
              domain shared with Su(z)2 and bmi-1 using in vitro mutagenesis and             
              chimeric genes combined with assays for mutant rescue, chromosomal             
              binding, and if possible DNA binding in vitro.  We will also                   
              continue our analysis of the developmental function of Psc.  We                
              will use antibody staining and lacz expression from enhancer traps             
              in embryos that lack both maternal and zygotic Psc function to                 
              determine if it is the initiation or maintenance of gene expression            
              patterns that is effected in several of the developmental pathways             
              that are perturbed by a lack of Psc function.***//
