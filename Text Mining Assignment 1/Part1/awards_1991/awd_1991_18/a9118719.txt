Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  In this research conference proposal, the aim is to convene               
              a meeting of scientists to present findings on a broad range of                
              genetic, molecular, biochemical and structural aspects of                      
              Chlamydomonas. The meeting is to be held at the Asilomar Conference            
              Center in Pacific Grove, California, from May 26-May 31, 1992.                 
              Approximately 200 scientists from around the world are expected to             
              attend.                                                                        
                                                                                             
              Chlamydomonas is an outstanding model organism for studies in                  
              genetics, biochemistry, and in cell and molecular biology. The                 
              biennial Chlamydomonas conference draws investigators from a broad             
              range of sub-disciplines in biology to discuss the common                      
              approaches and methodologies being used with this organism. The                
              meeting is important for the dissemination of new information, for             
              establishing collaborations, and for promoting the exchange of                 
              mutants and molecular probes. The meeting provides new                         
              investigators with an overview of the potential value of                       
              Chlamydomonas as an experimental organism and scientists already               
              working with the alga with an update of the latest findings.
