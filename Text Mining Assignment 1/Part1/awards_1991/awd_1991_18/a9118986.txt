Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The overall goal of this work is to determine the mechanisms of                
              evolution of physiological regulatory systems.  We have identified             
              an excellent model system for such studies:  the gastrointestinal              
              hormones cholecystokinin (CCK) and gastrin in the alligator.  We               
              will test the hypothesis that gastrin and gastrin receptors evolved            
              from CCK and CCK receptors in the primitive reptilia.  The specific            
              aims of the proposed studies are to determine the structures of CCK            
              and gastrin in the alligator and to determine the properties of                
              the alligator CCK and gastrin receptors.  Alligators are important             
              in evolutionary studies because they are closely related to the                
              ancient reptiles that gave rise to all modern birds and mammals.               
              including man.  One of the hallmarks of evolution is the generation            
              of new systems for regulation physiological processes, such as                 
              digestion.  This increased sophistication of digestion played a                
              major role in the evolution of endothermy, or warm-bloodedness,                
              characteristic of birds and mammals.  Endothermy, in turn, allowed             
              birds and mammals to become much more successful than reptiles.                
              Thus, studies of hormones and their responses in alligators will               
              lead to important new insights into the mechanisms of evolution of             
              physiological systems crucial to the success of life.
