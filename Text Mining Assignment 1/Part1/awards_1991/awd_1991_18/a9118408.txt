Abstract    :
              The principal investigators will study the petrology, structure,               
              and geologic history of the ultra-magnesian metamorphic rocks in               
              the southwestern Pamir Mountains of the Soviet republic of                     
              Tajikistan. The study will take place in cooperation with                      
              scientists from the Soviet Union and has also been approved on the             
              Soviet side. The study is aimed at understanding the processes                 
              involved in the metamorphism of these rocks, as well as the                    
              associated tectonic history. It will also contribute to knowledge              
              of the collisional processes that resulted in the formation of the             
              Alpine-Himalayan orogen.
