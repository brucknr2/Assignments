Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Male reproductive processes in flowering plants occur in the                   
              anther.  This organ is composed of several specialized tissues                 
              and cell types and is responsible for producing pollen grains                  
              that contain the sperm cells.  Anther tissues form in an orderly               
              pattern from cell lineages that are present within the floral                  
              meristem.  These tissues differentiate from precursor cells that               
              appear at specific locations, or territories, within the                       
              developing anther primordium.  The molecular processes                         
              responsible for the specification of different anther cell types               
              after primordium initiation are not known.  Nor is it understood               
              how gene sets that are expressed in specific anther cell types                 
              are activated coordinately during anther development.                          
              Experiments outlined in this proposal will utilize chimeric                    
              cytotoxic and anticytotoxic genes to address the role of                       
              cell/cell interaction processes in the specification of anther                 
              cell types.  Other experiments will utilize molecular strategies               
              to identify elements of the regulatory circuitry necessary to                  
              activate several non-homologous genes within one anther tissue,                
              the tapetum.  The significance of these experiments is that they               
              should provide new insight into the communication processes                    
              required for the differentiation of anther cell types, provide                 
              entry into the processes required for the differentiation of                   
              anther cell types, provide entry into the molecular pathways                   
              responsible for the specification of these cell types, and                     
              generate new conceptual information on the mechanisms that                     
              control cell-specific gene expression during plant development.
