Abstract    :
              Mount Erebus is the most active volcano in Antarctica having been              
              in a continuous eruptive state throughout this century.  The                   
              volcano is unique in containing a persistent convecting lava lake              
              composed of highly alkalic anorthoclase phonolite magma.                       
              Eruptive activity from the lava lake and adjacent vents has                    
              consisted of minor strombolian eruptions which occasionally eject              
              volcanic bombs to heights of over 500 meters.  Recent work has                 
              also shown Mount Erebus to be an important source of aerosols to               
              the pristine Antarctic atmosphere.  It is likely that Erebus                   
              contributes significant quantities of Chlorine, Fluorine and                   
              other trace components to the snow falling on the East Antarctic               
              ice sheet.  This has important consequences to chemists who are                
              trying to decipher paleoenvironments from snow and ice core                    
              analyses.  This award supports the establishment of the Mount                  
              Erebus Volcano Observatory at McMurdo Station to allow continued               
              surveillance of Mount Erebus.  This will contribute greatly of an              
              understanding of the degassing behavior of an "open vent"                      
              volcano.  Measurements of Sulfur Dioxide emissions made at  Mount              
              Erebus between 1983 and 1991 are amongst the most extensive and                
              detailed made at any volcano in long periods if a complete                     
              understanding of the degassing and eruptive behavior of this                   
              unique volcano and its magnetic system is going to be obtained.
