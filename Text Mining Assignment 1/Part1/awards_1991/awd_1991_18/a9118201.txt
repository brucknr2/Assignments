Abstract    :
                This research will support analysis of seismic data from two                 
              past deployments of the PANDA seismic array along the eastern                  
              margin of the central Andes.  The goal is to determine 1) the                  
              crustal thickening across the eastern margin of the central                    
              Andean plateau; 2) the seismic wave velocities within, and the                 
              continuity of, the subducted Nazca plate; and 3) the depths of                 
              mantle transition zone discontinuities near 400 km and 650 km                  
              near the subducted Nazca plate.  It is anticipated that this                   
              research will provide new constraints on mechanisms of                         
              earthquakes and uplift in the central Andean plateau, and on the               
              thermal structure of the subducted plate and adjacent mantle.                  
              This research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard                 
              Reduction Program.
