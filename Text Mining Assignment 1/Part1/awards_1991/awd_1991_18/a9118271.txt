Abstract    :
              The principal investigator will study the generation of melts in               
              planetary interiors, transport within the interiors, and chemical              
              differentiation processes. To do so he will experimentally study               
              both natural and synthetic igneous systems over a wide range of                
              temperatures and pressures, utilizing petrologic, analytical, and              
              modelling techniques. The aim is to reach a better understanding               
              of planetary differentiation through igneous processes. The results            
              of this work will be crucial to a geologic understanding of the                
              development and evolution of the Earth as a planet.
