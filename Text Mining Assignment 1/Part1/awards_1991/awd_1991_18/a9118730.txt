Abstract    :
              Cryptoendolithic microorganisms colonize the upper few millimeters             
              of limestone rocks of the Antarctic desert.  These microbes live               
              in a critically extreme environment, near the absolute limit of                
              their physiological potential.  Water from snowmelt and light                  
              penetrate the rocks but growth appears to be limited by the extreme            
              low ambient temperatures.  A climatic gradient has been observed               
              to span a range of sites located in the McMurdo Dry Valleys.                   
              This study will quantify environmental conditions.  Automatic                  
              data loggers will monitor the microscale climate inside rocks,                 
              and computer models based on these measurements will help                      
              identify the exact environmental threshold between life and                    
              extinction.  Transmission electron microscopy will be used to                  
              document the degradation of dead communities and the formation of              
              trace fossils.  The communities studied here have been proposed                
              as a terrestrial model for the last stages of life on early Mars.              
              The results of these studies will serve to reconstruct the                     
              process of extinction on Mars and suggest the form its present-                
              day traces might take.  This project is jointly supported by
