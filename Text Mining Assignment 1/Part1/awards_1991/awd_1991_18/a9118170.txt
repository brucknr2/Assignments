Abstract    :
                   A strong discordance exists between displacement estimates                
              for Cordilleran tectonic terranes inferred from paleomagnetic                  
              studies as opposed to geologic studies.  Existing paleomagnetic                
              data from southern Alaska suggest large northward displacements of             
              the Chugach-Prince William (CPW) terrane with respect to the                   
              southern Alaska terrane since the lower Tertiary, but geologic                 
              evidence suggests the two terranes were juxtaposed in early                    
              Tertiary time.  However, the paleomagnetic data base for the CPW               
              terrane is small and highly variable and may therefore be                      
              unreliable.  This study will resolve the discrepancy by detailed               
              paleomagnetic analysis of a suite of ophiolitic and dike rocks                 
              already obtained from the Kenai Peninsula and Knight-Island.  The              
              results will clarify the tectonic evolution of the northern                    
              Cordillera, particularly the Alaskan segment, and will have bearing            
              on orogen-parallel displacement estimates for accreted terranes in             
              other orogenic belts.
