Abstract    :
                   This action provides for the design (or re-design) and pre-               
              test of several questions intended for inclusion in the annual                 
              Survey of Industrial Research and Development conducted for NSF                
              by the Bureau of the Census.  NSF and Census staff have                        
              previously identified several key areas where questionnaire                    
              improvements are needed; efforts to identify additional areas                  
              will continue during the conduct of this project.                              
                   Under authority granted by the National Science Foundation                
              Act of 1950, NSF collects and disseminates descriptive economic                
              statistics, as well as other pertinent information, about                      
              scientific and technological resource utilization and activities.              
              Data collected by the Survey of Research and Development in                    
              Industry, when used in combination with data obtained through                  
              other NSF statistical and analytical activities, provides policy               
              makers with an overview of R&D funding and performance in the                  
              United States.
