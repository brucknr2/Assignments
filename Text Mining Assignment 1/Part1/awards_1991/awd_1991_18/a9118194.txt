Abstract    :
              Transcriptional activation of genes during the defense response has            
              been widely establish as a major level of regulation.  However, the            
              cis-elements and trans-acting factors involved in transcriptional              
              activation have been characterized for only a few defense genes.               
              In addition to positive regulation, there is also evidence for                 
              negative regulation of gene expression during the defense response.            
              However, only 3 genes whose mRNAs are negatively regulated have                
              been cloned and the cis elements and trans factors involved in                 
              their regulation are completely unknown.  A major overall aim of               
              this proposal is to identify and compare the mechanisms underlying             
              the positive and negative regulation of genes involved in the                  
              defense response.  A second major aim is to elucidate the                      
              mechanisms for the differential espression of the central                      
              phenylpropanoid and phytoalexin branch pathway genes.
