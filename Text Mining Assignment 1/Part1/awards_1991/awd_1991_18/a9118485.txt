Abstract    :
              This award supports a project designed to confirm that the East                
              Antarctic ice sheet in the David Glacier area has become thinner               
              in the past 100,000 years and to use rocks deposited by the ice to             
              study the geology of the ice-covered area of East Antarctica.  As              
              a secondary objective the project will also collect samples of                 
              Jurassic basalt and dolerite in the nunataks exposed in the David              
              Glacier area for a geochemical and isotopic study designed to test             
              the hypothesis that renewed volcanism of hydrothermal alteration               
              of these rocks occurred in post-Jurassic time.  The detection of               
              a climate change in the study area will be a significant                       
              contribution to current efforts to use climate records from the                
              recent past to predict future climate trends.
