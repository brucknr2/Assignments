Abstract    :
              This award is for support of a project to measure the helium                   
              concentrations and isotope ratios, K/Ar ratios, and Krypton                    
              81 ages in ice from Vostok Station, Antarctica.  The helium                    
              program is a search for nulls and/or reversals of the                          
              Earth's magnetic field, which should leave a strong signal                     
              in the helium 3 to helium 4 ratios and the helium 3                            
              concentrations in ice core helium.  If a geomagnetic helium                    
              event is recorded in the ice sheets, it will provide a                         
              world-wide traceable horizon in both Greenland and                             
              Antarctica, for model studies of ice flow and for                              
              chronology.  The Kr/Ar measurements are to study                               
              gravitational fractionation of gases in the firn.  The                         
              Krypton 81 dating will provide the first absolute age on the                   
              Vostok core.
