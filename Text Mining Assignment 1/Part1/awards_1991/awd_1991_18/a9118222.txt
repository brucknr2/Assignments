Abstract    :
                   Recent numerical modeling of the Basin and Range extension                
              process indicates that the lower crust must have a low viscosity               
              in order for the Moho to remain flat, as required by seismic                   
              observation.  Assuming this modeling is correct, the Lake                      
              Bonneville uplift should be re-examined with the goal of searching             
              for earth models with low-viscosity lower crusts which satisfy the             
              Lake Bonneville relict shoreline data.  Preliminary modeling using             
              an approximation to the Lake Bonneville load indicates that such               
              models may successfully predict the Lake Bonneville uplift.  The               
              PI will examine a range of plausible low-viscosity lower-crustal               
              earth models using a realistic model of Lake Bonneville and                    
              assuming linear viscoelastic rheologies.  He will undertake finite-            
              element modeling to incorporate such effects as power-law flow and             
              an elastic-brittle upper crust.  The modeling is significant                   
              because it may revise previous estimates of the upper-mantle                   
              viscosity beneath the Basin and Range, as well as indicate whether             
              the Lake Bonneville uplift is compatible with the fluid lower crust            
              required by other modeling.
