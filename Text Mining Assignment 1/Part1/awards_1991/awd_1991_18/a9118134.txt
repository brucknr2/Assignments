Abstract    :
              This award supports the acquisition of equipment for analysis of               
              sedimentary record forming processes in a number of different                  
              environments.  This award will forward process-oriented research in            
              Arctic fjords, high latitude marine shelf sedimentary systems,                 
              marine outer shelf and slope environments, and geochemical                     
              processes governing carbonate mineral precipitation.  The equipment            
              requested includes:  an alpha spectroscopy system, a carbon-                   
              nitrogen analyser system, and a spectrophotometer.  The requested              
              equipment will complement the analytical base at Northern Illinois             
              University which is well developed for research and teaching in the            
              geological record of environmental change, and in the processes                
              governing the formation of the geological record in Arctic and                 
              Antarctic environments.
