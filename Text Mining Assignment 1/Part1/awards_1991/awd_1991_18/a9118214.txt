Abstract    :
              This award is to provide support for the 7th International                     
              Symposium on Water-Rock Interaction (WRI-7).  The NSF funds will               
              be used to provide complete or partial expenses for the travel,                
              registration and accommodation of graduate students and aspiring               
              young scientists, and also a few foreign keynote speakers.  The                
              WRI-7 Symposium will be held in Park City, Utah, July 13-18, 1992.             
              The symposium will consist of 4 days of oral and poster sessions               
              and a mid-session field trip on July 16.  The WRI-7 meeting is                 
              expected to attract about 600 scientists and accompanying members              
              from about 40 countries with about half coming from the USA.
