Abstract    :
                   In central and western New England both the Taconic and the               
              Acadian orogenies were involved in the evolution of the eastern                
              edge of North America during the lower Paleozoic.  Traditionally               
              these have been treated as separate events of Ordovician and Late              
              Silurian-early Devonian age respectively.  Recent work has produced            
              a model for this area that proposes that the two events were                   
              actually part of a continuum of tectonic processes that operated               
              as the ancient proto-Atlantic ocean closed.  The study will involve            
              U-Pb geochronology of zircons, monazites, sphenes and apatites to              
              constrain both the protolith ages of key units in Vermont,                     
              Massachusetts and Connecticut, and the ages of their peak                      
              metamorphism.
