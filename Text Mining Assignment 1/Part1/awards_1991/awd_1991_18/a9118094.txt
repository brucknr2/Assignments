Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Our proposal is concerned with the mechanical properties of the                
              staminal filaments of thistles, and the role of stimulus                       
              transduction and transmission in thigonastic movements. Earlier                
              studies have shown that these filaments are highly elastic compared            
              to other plant parts but specific data are still lacking. The                  
              unique combination of mechanical properties of cuticle and cells               
              as a means of biological function positions our research activities            
              in a multi-disciplinary area. The multi-disciplinary approach is               
              evident in that not only biologists (KH Hasenstein, T. Pesacreta,              
              V. Sullivan) but also a materials scientist (e. MArtin) are                    
              involved in the project. Because both living cells and biopolymers             
              of the cuticle  and other portions of the cell wall are involved               
              in the function of the staminal filaments, our research will                   
              interface three divisions: materials research, cellular biosciences            
              and molecular biosciences and molecular biosciences. Since we                  
              propose to share existing laboratory facilities rather than                    
              purchasing new equipment, and additional criterium of the program              
              description is met.
