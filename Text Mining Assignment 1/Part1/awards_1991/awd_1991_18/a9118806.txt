Abstract    :
              This award supports a program of detailed field and                            
              laboratory studies of Cenozoic volcanic rocks in Marie Byrd                    
              Land, Antarctica.  This area, one of the earth's largest                       
              volcanic provinces, contains important records of Cenozoic                     
              glacial-volcanic history, petrogenesis, and tectonic                           
              evolution of West Antarctica.  This project will extend                        
              detailed field coverage to Marie Byrd Land volcanoes which                     
              are still known only on a reconnaissance level.  Subsequent                    
              laboratory studies will include geochemical and isotopic                       
              analyses, radiometric dating, and surface exposure dating.                     
              This is an international cooperative program involving U.S.,                   
              U.K., and N.Z. geoscientists.
