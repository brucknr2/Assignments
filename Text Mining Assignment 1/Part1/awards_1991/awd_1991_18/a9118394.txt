Abstract    :
                   The Kigluaik Mountains in Alaska contain a granulite facies               
              (high-temperature) metamorphic overprint on relatively cool, high              
              pressure, epidote-blueschist rocks.  Two competing hypotheses for              
              this juxtaposition are (1) that it represents an extensional                   
              metamorphic core complex with a pronounced structural break between            
              the different grade rocks, and (2) that the high temperature meta-             
              morphism formed in response to thermal re-equilibration of                     
              thickened crust with no structural break.  This study will directly            
              test the second hypothesis by an integrated program of field work,             
              petrology and geochronology.  It will also evaluate heat transport             
              mechanisms for the high grade rocks.  The results will provide                 
              important constraints on the thermal history of deep seated parts              
              of orogens immediately post-collision, and will thus have wide                 
              tectonic significance.
