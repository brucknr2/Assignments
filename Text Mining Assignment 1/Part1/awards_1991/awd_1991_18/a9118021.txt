Abstract    :
                   Previous paleomagnetic studies of Ordovician-aged volcanic                
              rocks from the northern Appalachians indicate accretion of volcanic            
              terranes to the margin of Laurentia was complete by the late                   
              Silurian to early Devonian.  These terranes are thought to                     
              represent vestiges of lapetus Ocean.  Their accretion was                      
              accompanied by considerable strike-slip motion.  This study will               
              use paleomagnetic measurements on Ordovician and Silurian rocks at             
              the Laurentian margin of Newfoundland, New Brunswick, Quebec and               
              Maine to test existing models of terrane accretion.  The results               
              will be of significance to understanding the tectonic evolution of             
              lapetus through the Paleozoic.
