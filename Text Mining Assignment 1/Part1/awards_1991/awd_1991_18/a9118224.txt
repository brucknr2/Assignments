Abstract    :
              Dr. Fenn will use a relatively new technique of Electrospray Mass              
              spectrometry to study the conformation of macromolecules.                      
              Specifically, he will:  (1) obtain experimental data on the non-               
              covalent forces between amino acid molecules by using tandem mass              
              spectrometry methods to measure the energies required to                       
              dissociate small clusters produced by ES ionization; (2) obtain                
              experimental information on the surface area of a protein                      
              conformer ion and to investigate the hydrophobic and hydrophilic               
              heterogeneity of that surface.  Although emphasis will be placed               
              on proteins in solution, other kinds of polymers will be                       
              considered because they may provide useful perspectives.                       
              %%%                                                                            
              The conformation or "tertiary structure" of protein molecules                  
              determines their biological activity and so is a governing factor              
              in many if not most of the chemical processes in living systems.               
              Consequently, it is of vital importance to understand for any                  
              protein molecule what its active configuration is along with why               
              and how it comes about.  A hoped-for byproduct of these studies                
              will be some insight on mechanisms by which solute ions are                    
              formed from charged droplets.
