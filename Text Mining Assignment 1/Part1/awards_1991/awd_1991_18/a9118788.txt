Abstract    :
                   The growth of continents at their margins is an important                 
              process encompassing a variety of poorly understood mechanisms.                
              Although well-studied, there remain major unresolved questions                 
              about the tectonic evolution of the Sierra Nevada in California                
              that resulted in accretion of arc material and various terranes to             
              the North American continent.  Prior work has outlined a number of             
              alternatives for aspects of the Mesozoic activity in this area                 
              including the cause and timing of metamorphism and igneous                     
              intrusion.  This project is a collaborative, integrated study of               
              deformation and metamorphism in the central part the Foothills                 
              Terrane, a key are containing a number of through-going faults                 
              separating significantly different assemblages of rock.  Results               
              are expected to resolve differences in conclusions drawn for the               
              Foothills Terrane to the north and south and to provide the basis              
              for an integrated model for the construction and deformation of                
              arcs in this tectonic setting.
