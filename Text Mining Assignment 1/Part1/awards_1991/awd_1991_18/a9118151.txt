Abstract    :
                   The western Banda arc is a natural laboratory where plate                 
              collision is in progress.  This study will construct a series of               
              balanced cross-sections across the orogen using newly available map            
              and geophysical data, and field data to be acquired during the                 
              project.  Because the Banda orogen is a good example of oblique                
              collisional processes, it offers an opportunity to analyze the                 
              sections in 3D space plus time.  The results will help resolve                 
              existing hypotheses for the evolution of the Banda orogen and will             
              be applicable to collisional orogenic processes in general.
