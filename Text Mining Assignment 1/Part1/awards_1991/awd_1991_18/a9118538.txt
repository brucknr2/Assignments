Abstract    :
                   Ductility directly related to crustal fluids may play a very              
              important role in the distribution of crustal seismicity and large             
              scale crustal deformation in the Puget Sound region.  The strong               
              correlation between crustal fluids and electrical resistivity makes            
              for specific, testable predictions about the resistivity structure.            
              The most fundamental are that there will be a sharp resistivity                
              decrease at the top of the seismically active crust if it coincides            
              with the base of the volcanics and another at the bottom of the                
              seismically active lower crust if it coincides with a brittle-                 
              ductile transition associated with trapping of water by a                      
              metamorphic boundary.  A combined Magnetotelluric (MT) and Magnetic            
              variation (MV) array study capable of making the required tests                
              will be carried out.
