Abstract    :
                Glycophorins are among the best studied mammalian integral                   
              membrane proteins, and yet, very little is known about their                   
              functions or about the regulation of expression of variant                     
              glycophorin forms.  This research will focus primarily on the                  
              development of approaches to the study of expression and function              
              of glycophorin. A transfection system will be developed for high               
              levels of cell surface expression of the introduced gene in NIH/3T3            
              cells.  The establishment of such a system will make it possible to            
              test hypothesized roles of sialoglycoproteins in the cell.                     
                                                                                             
              The long term goal of this project is to establish more detailed               
              information on the basic biology of glycophorins as membrane                   
              proteins.  Glycophorins are collectively the major class of                    
              sialoglycoprotein on the surface of mature red blood cells, and are            
              extremely well characterized in terms of protein and carbohydrate              
              chemistry.  Glycophorin has been implicated as a factor in a number            
              of diseases (e.g., as the receptor for entry of malaria parasites              
              into the erythrocyte).  Surprisingly, very little is known of its              
              function(s) in the cell.  These studies, if successful, will pave              
              the way toward understanding the biology of glycophorins.
