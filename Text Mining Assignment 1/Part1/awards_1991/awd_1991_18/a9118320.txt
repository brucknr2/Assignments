Abstract    :
                   Research in theoretical elementary particle theory will                   
              focus on attempts to relate the fundamentals of string theory,                 
              which pertain to very high energies far beyond those soon to                   
              be accessible, to "low-energy" physics which can be explored                   
              with the next generation of accelerators.  String theory is a                  
              promising candidate for a theory of all the basic forces of                    
              nature, including gravity.  However, it is crucial that ways                   
              be found to test this theory experimentally.  The finding of                   
              these ways is the intended main thrust of this project.
