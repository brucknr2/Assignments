Abstract    :
              Dr.Herbert Edelsbrunner is a young computer scientist who has already          
              made fundamental contributions to the emerging field of computational          
              geometry.  The Alan T. Waterman award committee has recommended                
              Dr. Edelsbrunner for this award, selecting him from among 97 nominees.         
              This award carries a grant of $500,000 for three years.  Dr.                   
              Edelsbrunner will be the sixteenth recipient of the Alan T. Waterman           
              award.                                                                         
                                                                                             
              Dr. Edelsbrunner is a pioneer in the field of computational geometry           
              which deals with the representation and manipulation of geometric              
              shapes and patterns.  Coping with the real-world objects requires              
              taking into consideration their real geometries rather than treating           
              them as idealized, oversimplified shapes.  Computational geometry is           
              thus going to be of utmost importance in computational science and             
              computer-aided design.                                                         
                                                                                             
              Dr. Edelsbrunner has had a tremendous impact on computational geometry         
              by his own research as well as by his l987 book Algorithms in                  
              Combinatorial Geometry which systematized the field in its early               
              days.  This book is considered by many people to be still the best             
              textbook and reference source on computational geometry.  He has also          
              influenced the field by being active professionally in it.  He has             
              organized a number of conferences and workshops on the subject.  He            
              has also served as editor for several journals on computational                
              geometry and related subjects.                                                 
                                                                                             
              There is no question that Dr. Edelsbrunner's work is of the highest            
              research quality and is having far-reaching impact.  This award is             
              highly recommended.
