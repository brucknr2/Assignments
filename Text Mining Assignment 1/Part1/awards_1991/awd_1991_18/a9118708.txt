Abstract    :
              The principal investigator will study the geochemical consequences             
              of various rate-determining physical and chemical processes such               
              as advection by a fluid, diffusion in fluids and solids, finite                
              exchange kinetics between fluids and solids, and chemical diffusion            
              in silicate melts. Results of the work will have important                     
              implications for interpreting data from igneous, metamorphic, and              
              sedimentary materials.
