Abstract    :
              This project uses a two wavelength (4278 and 6300 A) intensified               
              optical all sky imager which was especially developed for this                 
              project to make digital and video images of the aurora above South             
              Pole Station.  The objective is to investigate the electrodynamics             
              of the polar cap and cleft regions by making measurements of the               
              auroral precipitation patterns and interpret the results in terms              
              coordinated observations of magnetic, radio wave absorption images             
              and high frequency coherent scatter radar measurements.  It is                 
              hoped that understanding can be gained about the source regions and            
              energization mechanisms of auroral particles and other forms of                
              energy inputs into the high latitude atmosphere.                               
                                                                                             
              The Lockheed Space Sciences Laboratory is uniquely qualified to                
              make these measurements.
