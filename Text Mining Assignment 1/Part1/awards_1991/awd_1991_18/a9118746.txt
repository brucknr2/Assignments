Abstract    :
              The proposed work investigates the signals that initiate                       
              formation of the central nervous system during embryonic                       
              development.  Specifically, it examines the relationship between               
              two cellular events that occur in response to neural induction in              
              the Xenopus embryo: the increase in activity.  It further                      
              investigates the roles of the increase in pHi and the activation               
              of protein kinases in the switch from epidermal to neural                      
              development.  This work will identify the ionic regulatory                     
              mechanisms resposible for the pHi increase and determine whether               
              protein kinase activity mediates this pHi increase in ectoderm                 
              cells, via microfluorimetry experiments involving the                          
              intracellular fluorescent pH indicator BCECF-dextran.  Other                   
              studies use immunohistochemistry and RNase protection assays to                
              ask whether increases in either pHi or protein kinase activity                 
              are responsible for changes in gene expression in the responding               
              ectoderm.  These studies should provide fundamental insight into               
              the cellular basis of developmental commitment, pattern                        
              formation, and the initiation of neurogenesis.
