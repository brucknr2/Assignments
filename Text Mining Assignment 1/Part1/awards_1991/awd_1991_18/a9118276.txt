Abstract    :
              The principal investigator will make a series of experimental                  
              measurements relevant to multicomponent diffusion in anhydrous                 
              silicate liquids. The aims are to document the diffusive coupling              
              of melt components, to provide a database for diffusion models, and            
              to attempt to determine melt species. The results will be used to              
              model crystal growth from magmatic liquids and to construct more               
              physically realistic configurational entropy models for such                   
              liquids.
