Abstract    :
                This research investigates seismic phases by stacking, or                    
              summing, long-period seismograms from the Global Seismic Network.              
              Work to date using this technique has successfully imaged dozens               
              of seismic phases, including many reflections from upper mantle                
              discontinuities, some of which had not previously been observed.               
              This work will be intensified with a goal of producing maps of                 
              upper mantle discontinuity topography, an important clue to the                
              nature of mantle convection models now undergoing intense                      
              discussion.  Close attention will be given to possible reflectors              
              in the D" region above the core-mantle boundary, an area                       
              important to models of plume convection in the mantle.
