Abstract    :
              This award is for support of a two year study to investigate                   
              several gas species in the air occluded in the Vostok ice cores.               
              The glacial-interglacial difference in the carbon isotope ratios of            
              carbon dioxide and methane will be measured, and should provide                
              information on the mechanisms controlling carbon dioxide and                   
              methane fluctuations in the atmosphere.  The pre-industrial                    
              interhemispheric difference in atmospheric carbon dioxide will also            
              be measured to obtain information on the pre-industrial biogenic               
              source variation and on the postulated northern hemispheric oceanic            
              sink.  The relative timing of the variations in carbon dioxide and             
              methane will also be studied.
