Abstract    :
                   A broad program of research in nuclear physics using an                   
              in-house accelerator at the University of Pennsylvania and                     
              other national facilities is supported by this grant.  Gamma                   
              ray spectroscopy of nuclei far from stability, heavy ion                       
              resonant systems, and resonances and other high energy nuclear                 
              excitations will be studied.  Development of accelerator and                   
              ion source systems for use in accelerator mass spectrometry is                 
              also supported.
