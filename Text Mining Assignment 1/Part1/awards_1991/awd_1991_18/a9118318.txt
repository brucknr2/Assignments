Abstract    :
                   Previous investigation of the garnet granulite-eclogite facies            
              transition exposed on Holsnoy Island, southwest Norway, suggests               
              that seismic velocity and density increases across a sharp (<1 m               
              thick) transition.  The magnitude of the changes are postulated to             
              be related to compositional changes (silica depletion and relative             
              enrichment of Fe2O3, MgO, and CaO) caused by fluid transport during            
              metamorphism plus fabric development during deformation.  Detailed             
              sampling, using paleomag drills, across the exposed reaction fronts            
              will be carried out to test this idea.  Resultant mineralogical and            
              chemical compositional determinations will be compared to seismic              
              velocity measurements at high confining pressure in order to                   
              understand the factors controlling the variations in velocity.                 
              Detailed petrofabric analysis of major mineral phases in eclogites             
              and granulites will be made with standard U-stage methods.  Seismic            
              velocity will be calculated from the preferred orientation data and            
              tested against velocities determined in the laboratory at high                 
              confining pressure.
