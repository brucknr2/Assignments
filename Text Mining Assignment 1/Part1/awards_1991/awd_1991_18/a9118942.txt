Abstract    :
              Recently developed electrophoretic and FPLC procedures enable                  
              each caroteno-chlorophyll-protein in a green plant, alga,                      
              cyanobacterium or photosynthetic bacterium to be purified                      
              without essentially displacing any pigment molecules or protein                
              subunits that are present in the component in situ.  These                     
              procedures are to be used in the proposed research.  The specific              
              questions to be answered are how are the approx. 250                           
              chlorophyll and carotenoid molecules and their associated                      
              proteins, which constitute most of the antenna of photosystem                  
              II, organized so that they absorb and efficiently transfer                     
              light energy to the photochemical reaction enter.  Similarly,                  
              how are the approx. 150 pigment molecules in a purple bacterial                
              photosystem arranged at the molecular level as well.

              The goal of the research is to contribute to basic knowledge                   
              about photosynthesis: specifically to energy trapping and                      
              migration in the antenna; antenna composition and structure;                   
              molecular organization of chlorophyll and carotenoid; and,                     
              assembly and disassembly of the photosynthetic apparatus.  The                 
              approach is a combination of biochemical, biophysical, and                     
              molecular biology studies.  Emphasis will be on those membrane                 
              components that contain chlorophyll and carotenoid molecules.                  
              These studies should  provide new information on the organization              
              of light-capturing proteins in diverse organisms.
