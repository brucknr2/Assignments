Abstract    :
              This project is in the general area of analytical and surface                  
              chemistry and in the subfield of separation science.  During the               
              tenure of this three-year continuing grant, Professor Olesik and               
              her students will pursue fundamental investigations of the                     
              physicochemical properties of conventional liquid chromatography               
              mobile phases that have been mixed with supercritical fluids,                  
              particularly supercritical carbon dioxide, to provide new mobile               
              phases with enhanced fluidities and diffusivities.  These new                  
              mobile phases will enable more rapid analysis by high performance              
              liquid chromatography (HPLC) and size exclusion chromatography                 
              (SEC).

              This research builds upon preliminary results and new theoretical              
              developments from Dr. Olesik's laboratory.  In addition to                     
              contributing to the fundamental basis of liquid chromatography,                
              these studies are relevant to other technologically important                  
              areas such as solvent extraction and synthesis where enhanced                  
              fluidity reaction environments can give rise to more efficient                 
              chemical processes.
