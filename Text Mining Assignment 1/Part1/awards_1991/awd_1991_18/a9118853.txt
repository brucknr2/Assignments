Abstract    :
              An award is made to provide partial support for a Materials                    
              Research Society Symposium at the annual meeting of the society in             
              Boston, MA, on December 2-6, 1991.  The topic of the symposium is              
              the Application of Multiple Scattering Theory to Materials Science.            
              Multiple scattering theory is a technique for treating the                     
              propagation of waves among scattering centers.  It is a powerful               
              technique and is used in a wide range of fields that are relevant              
              to materials science.  Recent developments have advanced the                   
              technique to the point where more realistic calculations are                   
              possible.  The symposium will bring together major researchers in              
              the field to discuss these advances and to present results of                  
              calculations of interest to the materials research community.
