Abstract    :
                   Morphology dependent stimulated Raman scattering, MDSRS, is               
              new nonlinear laser Raman technique that has been used to measure              
              the chemical composition of laboratory generated aerosol particles.            
                   As the equipment associated with MDSRS is compact and rugged              
              it may be possible to use MDSRS for in situ monitoring of tropo-               
              and stratospheric aerosol chemical content.  MDSRS is a new                    
              technique though and as such several aspects of the signal                     
              generation, i.e. the nonlinear gain process, are not clearly                   
              understood.  The main focus of this research is the development of             
              MDSRS into a full scale analytic technique.  Experiments will be               
              conducted to examine the influence of aerosol size and composition,            
              excitation wavelength, and illumination geometry on MDSRS signal               
              size.  The results of these experiments will allow ion of                      
              determination of the feasibility of using this new technique for in            
              situ studies of aerosol composition and heterogeneous chemical                 
              processes.
