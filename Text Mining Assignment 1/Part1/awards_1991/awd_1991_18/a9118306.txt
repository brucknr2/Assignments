Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The objective of this proposal is to expand the analysis of a                  
              gene that is required for the initiation of trichome                           
              differentiation.  This gene, GL1, was isolated and initially                   
              characterized during the previous granting period.  It was found               
              that the predicted polypeptide encoded by GL1 is homologous to                 
              the Myb class of transcriptional activators.  Interestingly, the               
              gene appears to be expressed in stipules, which develop at the                 
              base of the leaves, but not in leaf primordia where trichomes                  
              develop.  This result suggests that GL1 may be involved in the                 
              production of a diffusible signal that activates trichome                      
              formation.  Experiments are proposed to confirm or negate the                  
              stipule-derived, trichome morphogen hypothesis.  The PI also                   
              examine the mechanism behind the reduction in trichome formation               
              that is found in plants that contain a 35S-GL1 gene.  Other                    
              experiments are designed to identify the sequences that mediate                
              the temporal and spatial regulation of GL1, to begin to identify               
              genes that encode proteins that interact with GL1 promoter or                  
              that directly interact with the GL1 protein.  In addition,                     
              experiments are planned to determine if GL1 is regulated                       
              appropriately in other plant species and to begin the                          
              characterization of other members of the Arabidopsis myb gene                  
              family.
