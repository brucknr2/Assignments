Abstract    :
              This grant will allow the American Society of Civil Engineers                  
              (ASCE) to partially support representatives from Hungary,                      
              Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Rumania at a special technical session             
              of the ASCE Annual Convention in Florida in October, 1991.  The                
              special session is entitled: "Changes in Eastern Europe --                     
              Engineering Perspectives."  The prime purpose of the session is                
              technology transfer and the development of professional                        
              relationships with engineers and engineering organizations in                  
              Eastern Europe, particularly in areas of environmental,                        
              transportation, and building issues.
