Abstract    :
              A combination of analytical and computational techniques for                   
              the efficient numerical simulation of multiphase systems,                      
              including acoustic and electrical fields, will be developed.                   
              Several innovations are proposed to include the lubrication                    
              force, polidispersivity in the size of bubbles or particles,                   
              multiparticle interactions and wave propagation.                               
                                                                                             
              The work has scientific relevance in multiphase flow and                       
              processing, and may lead to an efficient use of high                           
              performance computers.
