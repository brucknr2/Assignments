Abstract    :
              A multidisciplinary study will examine certain important                       
              adaptations of the Weddell seal (Leptonychotes weddelli) which                 
              have made it a champion diver able to reach great depths (500m)                
              for long periods (over an hour) in the Antarctic Ocean.                        
              Scientists will focus on mechanisms of gas transport in the free               
              diving seal, using non-invasive ultrasonography to evaluate the                
              oxygen storage capacity of the seal's spleen and continuous laser              
              spectrophotometry to study during free diving the role of                      
              oxymyoglobin in skeletal muscle oxygen stores.  The diversion of               
              oxyhemoglobin to the heart and brain in lieu of the peripheral                 
              circulation will be examined.  A velocity meter will be perfected              
              to enable an estimate of the metabolic demands in diving seals.                
              These pioneering techniques of microprocessor monitoring of free               
              diving seals were developed by this team on previous Antarctic                 
              expeditions.  In parallel studies, the heart rate alterations of               
              fetal seals which allow this Antarctic seal to tolerate prolonged              
              periods of hypoxia during diving will be studied.  This research               
              project will advance an understanding of how adult and fetal                   
              marine mammals dive for prolonged periods.
