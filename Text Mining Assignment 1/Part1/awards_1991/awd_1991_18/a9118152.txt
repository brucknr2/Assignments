Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Anabaena is a filamentous cyanobacterium that responds to                      
              nitrogen deprivation by elaborating along the filaments semi-                  
              regularly spaced cells called heterocysts that are specialized                 
              for nitrogen fixation. The cells that differentiate in response                
              to nitrogen step down may be the same as those that first sense                
              nitrogen deprivation; or if the latter cells respond to nitrogen               
              deprivation by initiating a sequential process of scavenging                   
              nitrogen form contiguous cell, the differentiating cells may be                
              positioned distant from the cells that first sense nitrogen                    
              deprivation; or if differentiation merely makes manifest a latent              
              (albeit experimentally manipulable) pattern, the differentiating               
              cells may bear no consistent spatial relationship to the cells                 
              first sensing nitrogen deprivation. Dr. Wolk has developed an                  
              array of techniques to study spatial and temporal aspects of the               
              expression of genes in the developing filament, and dependency                 
              relationships between pairs of genes. This array includes the use              
              of transposons and site directed insertions that incorporate                   
              genes for luciferase to report on the activity of individual                   
              promoters cell by cell along a filament. To elucidate the                      
              mechanism of heterocyst spacing, he proposes to: 1) identify                   
              genes required for control of heterocyst formation, genes                      
              regulating early responses to nitrogen deprivation, and the                    
              dependency relationships among them; 2) elucidate the spatial                  
              relationship between the sites of activation of genes in response              
              to nitrogen deprivation, ant the location of eventual heterocyst               
              formation; 3) ascertain whether possible transcriptional                       
              inhomogeneities in nitrogen replete filaments bear any spatial                 
              relationship to subsequent differentiation; and 4) investigate                 
              how particular experimental manipulations affect differentiation               
              and pattern formation.
