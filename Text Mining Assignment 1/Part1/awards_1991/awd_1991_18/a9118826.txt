Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              It is proposed to systematically explore magnetic-flux vortex                  
              motion in the superconducting state, using a variety of                        
              investigative techniques.                                                      
                                                                                             
              This research addresses an important feature of high-temperature               
              superconductivity, one that is of both fundamental and practical               
              interest.
