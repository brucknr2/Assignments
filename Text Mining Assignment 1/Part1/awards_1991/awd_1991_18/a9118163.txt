Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This award provides funds to continue COCORP's program of deep            
              seismic reflection investigation of the continental basement within            
              the United States.  Specifically, during this award period the main            
              activity will involve the acquisition of an experimental explosive             
              CMP profile within the Williston basin, the specific goal being to             
              characterize Moho and upper mantle reflectivity in the region, as              
              part of an ongoing effort to understand the origin of intracratonic            
              basins.  The broader goal is to test whether low-fold explosive                
              profiling with "super multi-channel" receiver arrays can provide               
              a practical, and cost-effective means of imaging the lower crust               
              and upper mantle over wide regions of the cratons.  The project                
              will involve Cornell personnel as well as key outside                          
              investigators.  The program will continue to take advantage of the             
              advanced capabilities of Amoco's SGR (Seismic Group Recorder) -                
              equipped research seismic reflection crew, and for the first time              
              will involve collaboration with the U.S.G.S. for the collection of             
              explosive data.
