Abstract    :
                   The extinction of at least 33 genera of large mammals ca                  
              11,000 yr B.P. in the New World provides an excellent opportunity              
              to study the dynamics of continental scale extinctions.  Similar               
              magnitude extinctions occurred throughout the Cenozoic and help                
              define biostratigraphic Land Mammal Ages.  Because the extinctions             
              occurred within the range of radiocarbon dating, the Late                      
              Pleistocene events can be dated with the precision and accuracy                
              needed to address ecological issues.  By using accelerator mass                
              spectrometry 14C dating of individual fossils, it is possible to               
              date species to < +80 years at 11,000 yr B.P.  The proposed                    
              research will be the 14C dating of ~80-100 large mammal fossils                
              representing at least 15 North American genera that have undergone             
              major changes in geographic distribution.  The dating will help                
              establish  1) If extinctions occurred significantly after 10,800               
              yr B.P., 2) If genera went extinct over several millennia, or en               
              masse over a few hundred years and 3) If Late Pleistocene biotic               
              changes were at the level of individual species or entire animal               
              communities.  This research will be a major beginning for providing            
              time control in the multidisciplinary FAUNMAP project, a synthesis             
              of geographic ranges for Late Pleistocene and Holocene vertebrate              
              faunas in North America.
