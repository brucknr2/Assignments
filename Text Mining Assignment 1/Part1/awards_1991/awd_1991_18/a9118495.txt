Abstract    :
              This award supports an investigation of the strata exposed in the              
              Transantarctic Mountains which were deposited in a major foreland              
              basin that developed adjacent to the Gondwanide orogenic belt                  
              during the late Paleozoic and early Mesozoic.  Major features                  
              include the foreland basin, exposed in the central Transantarctic              
              Mountains; a hypothetical paleogeographic high; and an                         
              intracratonic basin, exposed in southern Victoria Land.                        
              Relationships between these basins and the high are unresolved                 
              due to a lack of data in the area between the Nimrod and Byrd                  
              Glaciers.  The proposed sedimentologic and stratigraphic analysis              
              will identify and correlate units and determine the factors that               
              controlled the formation, evolution, subsidence and sedimentation              
              in the two basins.
