Abstract    :
              The biological importance of small peptides relates to their                   
              activity at receptor sites of many different types.  The                       
              conformational flexibility of small linear peptides as a function              
              of their environment requires a very accurate understanding of                 
              conformational dynamics in order to make predictions by                        
              computational methods.  This project work will measure the                     
              activation energies for conformation changes by time dependent                 
              infrared spectroscopic methods.  The N-H vibrational motion of                 
              peptides is very sensitive to geometric changes and solvent                    
              interactions.  By experimentally exciting a large temperature jump             
              on a picosecond time scale the peptide conformations rearrange and             
              time dependent experimental measurements of the changes in the N-H             
              region of the infrared over 20 nanoseconds can be related to                   
              conformational dynamics.  The data will allow testing and                      
              refinement of molecular dynamics models.

              The impact of this work is to enable accurate computational                    
              predictions of peptide interactions in a wide variety of biological            
              phenomena.  Such accurate predictions are essential to understand              
              structure and function relationships.
