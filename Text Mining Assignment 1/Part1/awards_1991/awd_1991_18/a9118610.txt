Abstract    :
                   During Neogene extension in the southwest US extensive systems            
              of detachment faults have developed.  During crustal thinning and              
              extension sedimentary basins formed and were filled above the                  
              mobile and detached fault blocks.  The strata in these basins have             
              the potential to reveal many of the details of the dynamic                     
              evolution of these extending terranes.  This study will examine a              
              well-exposed example-the shadow valley basin in southern California            
              that developed above the Halloran Hills detachment complex.  The               
              objectives are to characterize the deposition of these sediments               
              and sources active during basin filling, to develop models of                  
              interactions between faulting, uplift and extension, tectonic and              
              erosional patterns and character within the supra-detachment                   
              basins.  Results are expected to provide insights into the rates               
              and processes associated with the development of detachment                    
              systems.
