Abstract    :
              This award supports a project to develop a coupled thermo                      
              mechanical model for margins of ice streams of the type                        
              draining the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS).  This model                      
              will provide a theoretical framework for interpreting                          
              measurements of velocity and ice temperature in ice stream                     
              margins in terms of changes in basal sliding behavior and                      
              ice flow law across the margin.  This work will allow the                      
              investigation of the possible controls on the positions of                     
              ice stream margins, with particular emphasis on the                            
              stability of a boundary between a frozen and a wet bed.                        
              Since the width of ice streams affects the discharge of                        
              inland ice through the ice streams into the ocean, an                          
              understanding of ice stream margins is fundamental to                          
              understanding the mass balance of the West Antarctic Ice                       
              Sheet, how it might change in the future, and what impact it                   
              could have on global sea level.
