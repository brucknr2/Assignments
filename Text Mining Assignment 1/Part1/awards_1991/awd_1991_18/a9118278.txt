Abstract    :
                   An integrated field mapping - laboratory- hydrologic modeling             
              study will be conducted for the "Kicking Horse Rim" of the southern            
              Rocky Mountains in Canada, a well-exposed belt of massive                      
              replacement dolostone approximately 10 to 15 km wide that                      
              demarcates the transition from shelf to basin along the Lower                  
              Paleozoic passive margin of western North America.  Preliminary                
              field work strongly suggests that the replacement dolomite is                  
              related to a complex network of large (hundreds of meter-scale),               
              dolomite breccia-and cement-filled fractures and pipes that riddles            
              the area.  Research will entail:  (1) mapping the locations of the             
              dolomite fractures and pipes through the massive dolomite of the               
              "Kicking Horse Rim"; (2) documenting the transitions from these                
              dolomitization centers into the fine-grained replacement dolomite              
              and ultimately into the host country rock; (3) analyzing the fluid             
              inclusion, isotopic and trace element geochemistry of the various              
              dolomites; and (4) using data from (1), (2), and (3) as modeling               
              constraints in numerical simulations of various hydrologic systems             
              that could be responsible for dolomitization.                                  
                   This study offers an integrated field-laboratory -modeling                
              approach toward dolomitization by examining a dolomite body similar            
              in scale to many other massive replacement dolomites found in                  
              carbonate platform deposits.  The Kicking Horse Rim dolomites are              
              important insofar as warm, near sea water salinity fluids may have             
              been important during dolomitization.  The approach outlined here              
              should be applicable to the problem of the origin of dolomites in              
              general.  Finally, the exact nature of the Kicking Horse Rim                   
              dolomite may have important implications for the argument as to the            
              geometry of the shelf to basin transition.
