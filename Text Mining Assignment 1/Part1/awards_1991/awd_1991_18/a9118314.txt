Abstract    :
              This award supports an investigation of the megafloras and                     
              palynofloras of the Allan Hills area in southern Victoria Land,                
              Antarctica.  The objectives for this project are to collect these              
              floras using modern methods (i.e., placing the floras within their             
              paleoecologic and stratigraphic settings) and to characterize the              
              plants contained therein in detail.  These data will provide                   
              taxonomic, paleoecologic, paleoclimatic and biogeographic                      
              information that can be compared with other better-known floras                
              (e.g., from the central Transantarctic Mountains) in Antarctica and            
              in Gondwana.
