Abstract    :
                   Today's practicing engineers run their simulation models                  
              iteratively to help create product designs, often through ad hoc               
              strategies for multiple runs.  It has been observed that: (a)                  
              there are efficient strategies for planning multiple simulation                
              runs; (b) many of these techniques are common across all                       
              engineering disciplines; and (c) there is a void in the United                 
              States engineering curriculum in this area.  The objective of this             
              effort is to create a modern course in engineering design, with a              
              focus on the exercise of computer models to improve the performance            
              and manufacturability of device and system designs, not just to                
              analyze existing designs.  An interdisciplinary course will provide            
              a common language and approach that will allow engineers from                  
              different disciplines to work together more effectively.  This will            
              result in better designs for products and systems.                             
                   This effort represents a unique and innovative mechanism for              
              training engineers in engineering design.  Tools of simulation will            
              be combined with a case study approach using extensive industrial              
              collaboration.  The modular development of this interdisciplinary              
              course will facilitate its transfer and use by manufacturing                   
              engineering programs throughout the country.
