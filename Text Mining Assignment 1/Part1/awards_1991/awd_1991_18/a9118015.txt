Abstract    :
              This award is for a year of development of U-, Th-disequilibrium               
              analyses utilizing high precision thermal ionization mass                      
              spectrometry in the Keck Center for Isotope Geochemistry at UCLA.              
              The requested funds will largely support personnel critically                  
              needed at this stage to develop protocols for the Th isotope                   
              analyses, and to perform and interpret the first generation of                 
              analyses on the new dual sector mass spectrometer.  Using Th                   
              isotopic analyses, the PIs will evaluate the temporal and chemical             
              evolution of magma processes for the lava fields of Craters of the             
              Moon, Idaho, and Pisgah crater, California.  Both fields have been             
              interpreted as erupting from magma chambers which have undergone               
              crustal assimilation, albeit of silicic material in the case of the            
              former and mafic material in the case of the later.  They will then            
              investigate paired Th-Pb isotope systematics of selected lavas from            
              diverse tectonic settings in the western U.S. for their utility in             
              characterizing lithospheric (crust and Mantle) versus                          
              asthenospheric components to magmagenesis.
