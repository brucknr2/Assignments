Abstract    :
              This is a five year Young Investigator Award.  The mechanisms that             
              enable eukaryotic cells to control the synthesis of membrane lipids            
              in coordination with ongoing membrane biogenesis are complex and,              
              to a great extent, unknown.  What is clear is that the phospholipid            
              precursor inositol plays a critical role.  Inositol containing                 
              phospholipids have been implicated in metabolic signalling process             
              that act to control cell growth and proliferation in higher                    
              eukaryotes.  An extensive analysis of inositol transport, and the              
              role of transport in the coordinated regulation of phospholipid                
              biosynthesis will be conducted in the unicellular eukaryotic                   
              organism, Saccharomyces cerevisiae.  The studies will involve the              
              genetic and biochemical characterization of inositol transport and             
              regulation of transport in mutant and wild type strains of yeast.              
              Strains harboring well-characterized regulatory mutations, in                  
              addition to the new mutants, will be used to identify the role of              
              inositol transport in the coordinated regulation of phospholipid               
              biosynthesis.  The mutants will also be used to facilitate the                 
              cloning of structural genes encoding the inositol transport.  The              
              cloned genes will be employed in molecular studies, including DNA              
              sequence analysis and analysis of transcriptional regulation in                
              response to exogenous precursors, such as inositol and choline.                
              It is expected that the proposed analysis will define a complex                
              regulatory circuitry which coordinates the uptake of inositol with             
              the continuous proportional synthesis of the phospholipids in the              
              growing cell.
