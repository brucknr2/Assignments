Abstract    :
                   The dike-gabbro transition zone is a fundamental lithological             
              and rheological boundary zone in the oceanic crust, in which the               
              interaction of magmatic and hydrothermal processes play an                     
              important role.  Dike-gabbro transitions are preserved in ophiolite            
              complexes, of which one of the best examples is the Troodos                    
              Ophiolite in Cyprus.  This ophiolite has been well studied                     
              petrologically and geochemically, but this study will be the first             
              attempt to systematically map the deformation associated with the              
              dike-gabbro transition.  The results will have important                       
              implications for the tectonics of ophiolite emplacement and will               
              also have bearing on mid ocean ridge processes.
