Abstract    :
              This award supports the analysis of calcareous nannofossil                     
              assemblages from high quality Deep Sea Drilling Project/Ocean                  
              Drilling Program (DSDP/ODP) drill cores from the South Atlantic and            
              Southern Ocean basins in order to reconstruct the thermal gradient             
              of surface waters of those basins for the Campanian to Cenozoic                
              time interval (84 million years ago to the present).  This research            
              applies statistical methods based on a polar ordination technique.             
              Using this technique, and refining it through closer sampling                  
              intervals and a wider spectrum of recent ODP sites, particularly               
              from the Antarctic Sector of the Southern Ocean (mainly ODP Legs               
              113 and 114 sites), this work will further refine the zonation and             
              biochronology of nannofossils of the Southern Ocean, characterize              
              major surface water masses and infer from biological gradients                 
              latitudinal thermal gradients, and record in detail latitudinal                
              shifts in surface water masses through time as a means of tracing              
              steps in the deterioration of global climates.
