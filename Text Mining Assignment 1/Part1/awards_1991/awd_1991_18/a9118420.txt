Abstract    :
              This State-of-the-Art survey award will send Dr. Senol Utku,                   
              of Duke University, to Japan to do a survey of recent Japanese                 
              developments in adaptive structures.   Dr. Utku will first                     
              attend the Second Joint Japan-U.S. Conference on Adaptive                      
              Structures at Nagoya, then spend a week visiting related                       
              Japanese industrial and academic research institutions working                 
              on adaptive structures and their control, and finally attend                   
              the International Workshop on Intelligent Robots and Systems,                  
              in Osaka, to discuss the use of adaptive structures as mechan-                 
              ical manipulators in space construction.
