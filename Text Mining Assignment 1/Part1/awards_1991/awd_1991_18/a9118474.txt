Abstract    :
              The overall goal of this laboratory's research is to understand on             
              a molecular level how the eukaryotic cell achieves its very                    
              efficient and closely regulated synthesis of rRNA, which comprises             
              over 75% of the total cellular RNA.  In the previous studies we                
              demonstrated systems for in vitro and in vivo expression of Xenopus            
              and mouse rDNA, localized the promoter sequences, and studied the              
              cellular components responsible for this expression and its                    
              regulation.  We now wish to extend these studies, and to that end              
              propose to examine the action of upstream rDNA transcriptional                 
              elements: the frog 60/81 bp repeats and 0/1 repeats, the mouse 140             
              bp repeats and the mouse spacer promoter region.  We propose a                 
              number of in vivo and in vitro experiments to determine whether the            
              enhancer repeats function via chromatin assembly, whether they                 
              affect the number or activity of active rRNA genes, whether and how            
              they affect factor binding to the promoter, and their dependence               
              upon helical face and ongoing transcription.***//
