Abstract    :
                   This award will provide for half the funds needed for the                 
              acquisition of a Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer.  The                 
              additional funding required for this acquisition has been committed            
              by the University of California at Santa Cruz.  It is anticipated              
              that studies utilizing this instrument will provide fundamental                
              constraints on a number of geochemical and geophysical processes.              
              These include, but are not limited to 1) examination of the                    
              structural changes taking place in silicate melts at high                      
              pressures, and thus potentially on differentiation processes                   
              occurring in the early Earth; 2) characterizing the speciation of              
              volatiles (primarily water and carbon dioxide) within both mixed               
              volatile-fluid phases at moderate pressures, and in volatile-                  
              bearing silicate assemblages, with relevance both for the solution             
              properties of fluids at high pressure and temperature, and for                 
              possible retention of volatiles in the deep Earth; 3) investigating            
              the response of bonding properties of minerals to high pressures,              
              with implications both for the thermochemical properties of                    
              minerals under extreme conditions, and for the mechanisms by which             
              minerals undergo metastable phase transitions; and 4) a novel                  
              method for potentially characterizing the thermal conductivity of              
              opaque materials at high pressures.
