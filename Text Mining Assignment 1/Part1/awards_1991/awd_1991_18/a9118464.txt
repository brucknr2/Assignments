Abstract    :
              In response to harmful environmental stresses, such as heat and                
              viral infection, organisms synthesize proteins called stress                   
              proteins or heat shock proteins.  Stress proteins may either                   
              protect organisms from the effects of stress or aid organisms                  
              during the recovery from stress.  Although stress proteins are                 
              induced in response to stress, some stress proteins are                        
              constitutively expressed.  This suggests that stress proteins                  
              also participate in normal cellular activities.  Stress proteins               
              may play a role in development, signal transduction, receptor-                 
              mediated endocytosis, and protein translocation.  The ability of               
              stress proteins to associate with other proteins suggests that                 
              they may mediate protein-protein interactions and facilitate                   
              protein folding and assembly.  Preliminary evidence presented in               
              this proposal suggests that a cytosolic factor facilitates the                 
              dissociation of complexes between cytosolic 70K stress proteins                
              and other proteins.  During the proposed research I will purify                
              and characterize this factor.  The isolation and study of the                  
              dissociation factor will provide insight into the molecular                    
              events leading to proper folding and assembly of proteins in                   
              vivo.
