Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              In higher plants, root and shoot apical meristems are established              
              during embryogenesis.  The structures of several shoot apical                  
              meristems have been deduced by combining histological studies with             
              clonal analysis.  However, the application of this approach to root            
              apical meristems has been limited by a lack of visible genetic                 
              markers.  The aim of the proposed research is to circumvent this               
              problem by performing clonal analysis on roots from transgenic                 
              plants containing the maize transposable element Ac in a B-                    
              glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene.  The gene is normally inactive.             
              Transposition of Ac activates the gene, however, leading to sectors            
              of cells expressing GUS.  The distribution of these sectors can be             
              used to establish whether the root apical meristems generates rot              
              tissue continuously or in units (phytomers) and whether the                    
              meristem is organized in single or multiple layers.  In the one                
              year period of the present grant, methods will be developed for                
              positive identification of GUS-expressing cells, and statistical               
              data will be obtained relating to the occurrence of different                  
              classes of sectors in transgenic roots of tomato, tobacco and                  
              Arabidopsis.
