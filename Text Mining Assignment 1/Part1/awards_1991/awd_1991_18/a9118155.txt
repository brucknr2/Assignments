Abstract    :
                   This award provides funding for 50% of the cost of acquiring              
              a high-pressure, multi-anvil press that will be installed and                  
              operated in the Department of Geological Sciences at the University            
              of Michigan. The University is committed to providing funds for the            
              remaining half.                                                                
                   The equipment is to be used primarily by the experimental                 
              petrology research group at the University of Michigan in a program            
              studying the behavior of water and other volatiles trapped in the              
              Earth's mantle under high-pressure-temperature conditions.
