Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Synthesis of silicon oxycarbide gels and glasses is achieved through           
              the hydrolysis/condensation of alkyl-substituted alkoxysilanes.  It            
              forms a gel whose subsequent heat-treatment in an inert atmosphere             
              creates an x-ray amorphous glass that contains both Si-O and Si-C              
              bonds.  The glass is often black due to the additional presence of             
              a highly dispersed form of polyaromatic, pyrolytic, and/or amorphous           
              carbon.  A primary objective of this project is to characterize, in            
              detail, the ternary Si-O-C system, and especially to determine the             
              molecular structure of the excess carbon, its relationship to the              
              oxycarbide network, and its effect on the thermochemical stability             
              of the glass.  NMR, Raman spectroscopy, and TEM will be used to                
              characterize the glasses.                                                      
              %%%%                                                                           
              Oxycarbide glasses exhibit enhanced properties.  Characterization of           
              the glass structure is essential for future exploitation of these              
              unique glasses.  This program is expected to yield valuable                    
              information and possibly to provide a basis for developing new                 
              reinforced composite materials, by sol-gel methods.
