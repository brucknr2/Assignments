Abstract    :
              Transcription attenuation in the Bacillus subtilis trp operon is               
              regulated by a trans-acting RNA binding protein, the product of the            
              mtr locus.  In the presence of tryptophan, Mtr recognizes, and                 
              presumably binds to, a site in the trp leader transcript.  This                
              binding influences the attenuator to form a transcription                      
              terminator.  The mtr locus contains two structural genes, mtrA and             
              mtrB; both are required to regulate the trp operon.  The objective             
              of this work is to determine how Mtr recognized its RNA target and             
              how it influences the attenuator to cause transcription                        
              termination.  Specific objectives are to: 1) purify Mtr and                    
              determine its subunit structure.  2) develop in vitro assays for               
              Mtr function including RNA binding and transcription regulation.               
              3) characterize the RNA target site in the trp leader transcript               
              and demonstrate  that Mtr binds this site.  Features of Mtr                    
              required for RNA-binding will also be studied.  4) determine the               
              mechanism of tryptophan activation of Mtr.  5) determine if Mtr                
              regulates other genes.  The importance of RNA-binding proteins as              
              gene regulators is clear.  Sequence- specific RNA-protein                      
              interactions regulate a wide range of cellular processes.  This                
              work will provide information about how proteins recognize RNA and             
              how RNA-binding proteins regulate gene expression.
