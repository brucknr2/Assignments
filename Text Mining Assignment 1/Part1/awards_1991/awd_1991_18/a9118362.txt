Abstract    :
              This award is for support of a project to develop and test a                   
              three-dimensional, time-dependent simulation of the West                       
              Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS).  The model will be used to test                    
              hypotheses for ice sheet behavior and to predict the future                    
              of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet.  The simulation will                          
              combine the high speed of finite difference models and the                     
              high and variable resolution of finite element models.  The                    
              simulation will have the capability to dynamically follow                      
              features of the ice sheet with the grid, which will provide                    
              a powerful tool for ice sheet prediction.
