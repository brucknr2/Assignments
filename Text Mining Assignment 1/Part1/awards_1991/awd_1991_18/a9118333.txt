Abstract    :
              The laboratory has been using monoclonal antibodies (MABs) to                  
              study the topology of selected proteins associated with                        
              photosynthesis in higher plants.  This is done by isolating and                
              cloning hybridomas which secrete MAbs of interest.  Once                       
              obtained, the ability of the Mabs to bind to various                           
              preparations (rightsideout thylakoids, insideout thylakoids,                   
              isolated Photosystem II membranes, isolated proteins, etc.) can be             
              asessed and in so doing it is possible to determine the exposure of            
              the specific epitopes to which the MAbs bind.  By cross correlating            
              our Mab binding data and epitope determination with hypothetical               
              models of protein topography based on hydropathic analyseSs of                 
              protein primary structure, more topologically correct models of                
              photosynthetic protein complexes of the thylakoid membrane can be              
              developed.
