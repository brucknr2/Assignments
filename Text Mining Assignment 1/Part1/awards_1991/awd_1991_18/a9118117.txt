Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Pattern formation on lepidopteran wings consists of the genetic and            
              cellular processes that control the patterned synthesis of specific            
              pigments.  The proposed investigations present an attempt to                   
              elucidate the mechanism involved in the patterned development of               
              one of the three major pigments in the wing, melanin (which is the             
              pigment that makes up all black portions of the pattern) in Precis             
              coenia and Heliconius charitonia (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae).  The              
              spatial patterns of protein synthesis during successive days in the            
              developing wing correspond precisely to the subsequent patterns of             
              pigment synthesis.  Patterned synthesis of phenoloxidase thus                  
              presages the subsequent pattern of melanin synthesis.  The aim of              
              the proposed investigation is to develop molecular probes for the              
              phenoloxidase gene.  The cloned phenoloxidase probes will be used              
              in subsequent studies on the role of the gene product in pigment               
              pattern formation.  The cloned gene will also be used in future                
              investigations on the control of patterned enzyme expression.
