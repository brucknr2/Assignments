Abstract    :
              The objective in this study is to investigate the modes of                     
              emplacement of lava flows in the giant Tertiary-age flood basalt               
              province of the Columbia River plateau.  Also planned is research              
              that should enable an estimate to be made of the amount of                     
              degassing that occurred during the extrusion of one or two selected            
              large lava flows.  In addition to gaining new insights into flood              
              basalt volcanism, knowledge of discharge rates, eruptive styles,               
              and volatile budgets of the magmas will be crucial to assessing the            
              environmental impacts of this end-member style of volcanic                     
              activity.  The PIs are testing methods of diagnosing flow surface              
              morphologies, vesicle distribution patterns, and internal flow                 
              structures of the lavas.  They also will be making parallel studies            
              on the characteristics of vent structures and feeder dikes to gain             
              additional information on discharge rates.
