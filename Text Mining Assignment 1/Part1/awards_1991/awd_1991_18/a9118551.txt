Abstract    :
              The objective of this proposal is to apply the Re/Os system to                 
              problems in mantle evolution and the nature of mantle magma sources            
              using the decay of 187Re to 187Os as the natural tracer.  This                 
              study will focus on 1) comparing the 187Os/186Os ratios of                     
              mid-ocean ridge basalts with those of ocean island basalts; 2) the             
              coupled use of 187Os/186Os and 3He/4He variations in basalts                   
              elucidating magma sources; 3) a systematic study of carefully                  
              documented samples of the Mesozoic Appalachian tholeiite province              
              of eastern North AMerica will determine the controls on Re and Os              
              abundances during generation and evolution of mantle-derived magmas            
              on long-term Re/Os systematics of lithosphere mantle.  The samples             
              will be analyzed for 187Os/186Os by negative ion thermal ionization            
              mass spectrometry (NTIMS).  Re concentrations will continue to be              
              determined by SIMS.  This work should provide a broader                        
              understanding of the origin of mantle magmas.
