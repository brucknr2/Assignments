Abstract    :
              The principal investigator will carry out a combined field and                 
              laboratory study of Archaean anorthosites from the high-grade                  
              gneiss complex of West Greenland, utilizing a variety of                       
              geochemical techniques. The work will result in new insights into              
              the nature of magmatic differentiation of anorthosite bodies and               
              place new constraints on their parent magma compositions. The work             
              will also bear on general problems related to the early crustal                
              evolution of the Earth.
