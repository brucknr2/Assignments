Abstract    :
                   An image analysis system attached to a scanning electron                  
              microscope will be utilized to obtain morphometric measurements of             
              selected Paleogene calcareous nannoplankton.  This technology will             
              open up a new method in studying nannoplankton phylogeny, which has            
              hitherto been hindered by the small size of these fossils.  The                
              combination of scanning electron microscopy and image analysis                 
              enable detailed measurements of several morphological parameters               
              to be made on a large number of specimens, leading to data set                 
              which can be statistically evaluated in terms of phylogenetic                  
              trends.   The simple shape of nannoplankton lends itself to shape              
              analysis using uncomplicated and unambiguous parameters.  The                  
              intention of this study is to construct a morphometric/phylogenetic            
              scheme which is largely independent of previous taxonomic                      
              complications.  Construction of this scheme will allow:  1)                    
              Quantitative assessment of the evolutionary mode and tempo of the              
              calcareous nannoplankton through the Paleogene, 2) Correlation of              
              evolutionary trends with paleoceanographic and paleoenvironmental              
              events, and 3) Development of a "morphometric biochronology" in                
              which an age and error bar can be obtained from morphological                  
              measurements on a small number of specimens.
