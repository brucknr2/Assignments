Abstract    :
              This project is to study four new eclogite xenolith localities from            
              Yakutia, Siberia.  It will provide a three-dimensional view of the             
              craton edifice at various depths and distances from the craton                 
              edge.  There has been much speculation and discussion over the                 
              petrogenesis of eclogite inclusions in kimberlite with some authors            
              favoring high pressure igneous fractionation and others low                    
              pressure igneous fractionation.  This study will compare and                   
              contrast pertinent chemical and isotopic signatures from the widely            
              separated Kaapvaal and Siberian cratons.  This multinational                   
              approach will include petrographic and mineral-chemical analyses               
              of selected xenoliths. The study will include an exchange of                   
              scientific personnel between the United States and the Soviet                  
              Union. A representative suite will be chosen for further                       
              whole-rock, major-and trace-element analyses and O, Rb-Sr, Sm-Nd,              
              U-Pb, and Re-Os isotopic analyses.  Finally, the PI will use the               
              results of this comprehensive study of the eclogite xenoliths of               
              the SIberian craton, along with other data, to achieve a more                  
              complete and global picture of the formation of mantle eclogites               
              and the structure and evolution of old cratons.
