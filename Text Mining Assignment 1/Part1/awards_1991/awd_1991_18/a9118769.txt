Abstract    :
              Composite materials are being developed for applications in the                
              design of bridges and buildings.  This project will investigate,               
              analytically and experimentally, the behavior of cable supported               
              bridges using composite cables.                                                
                                                                                             
              The bridges will be investigated for static and dynamic load                   
              conditions for the linear and non-linear range of the material.                
              The result of this research will be used to install cable hangers              
              in a suspension bridge.//
