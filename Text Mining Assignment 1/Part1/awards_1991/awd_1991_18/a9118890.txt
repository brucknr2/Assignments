Abstract    :
              An experimental study will be conducted of the feasibility of                  
              performing ..in situ laser spectroscopic measurements in a                 
              tribological surface force microscope.  This could allow                       
              determination of molecular behavior and micro.flows in molecularly             
              thin films on sliding surfaces and lead to better understanding of             
              the properties of boundary lubrication films and other thin                    
              molecular layers.  Initial experiments are aimed at determining                
              detection limits for a variety of laser.induced signals originating            
              from the small contact area and under the physical constraints                 
              enforced by the design of the surface force microscope.  Selected              
              long.chain molecular layers, deposited by the Langmuir.Blodgett                
              technique will be used.  The results will be used to design a                  
              surface force microscope with significantly improved capabilities.
