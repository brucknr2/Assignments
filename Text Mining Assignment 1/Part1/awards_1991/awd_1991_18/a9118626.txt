Abstract    :
                   Neural network threshold autoregressive models are                        
              investigated in this project.  This model may be used with                     
              advantage in pattern recognition.  Effect of a misspecified model              
              on forecasting will also be investigated.                                      
                   The properties of a predictive Kullback-Leibler divergence                
              measure will be investigated. Predictive diagnostic checking will              
              also be explored.
