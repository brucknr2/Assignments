Abstract    :
              The research objective is modification and testing of an existing              
              broadband seismometer for eventual installation in ocean borehole              
              OSN-1, drilled by the ODP in March of 1991 (Leg 136).  Augmentation            
              of world-wide seismograph coverage through the addition of ocean               
              floor seismic observatories will improve earthquake location, and              
              allow the more accurate determination of deep Earth velocity                   
              structure.                                                                     
              %%%                                                                            
              Understanding why and where earthquakes occur is essential to                  
              mitigating these natural hazards.  The earth motions induced by                
              earthquakes also provide detailed information on deep earth                    
              structure.  Such information is crucial to understanding such                  
              phenomena as the Earth's magnetic field, and the distribution of               
              mineral resources on the Earth's surface.  Our ability to measure              
              earthquakes, however, is severely limited by geographic constraints            
              on the placement of seismometers.  Heretofore, the two-thirds of               
              the Earth's surface that is water-covered has been inaccessible to             
              seismometer coverage.  Emplacement of borehole seismometers in                 
              ocean-sub-seafloor observatories is one solution proposed. This                
              research is the first step in the creation of a network of ocean               
              observatories: the modification and land-testing of a bore-hole                
              seismometer capable of recording earth motions over a wide band of             
              frequencies.
