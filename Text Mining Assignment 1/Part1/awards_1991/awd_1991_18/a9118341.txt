Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Minerals in biological systems are deposited in an organic and            
              matrix and assemble into calcareous structures or skeletons. The               
              organic matrix consists of soluble and insoluble components                    
              containing lipids, carbohydrates and glycoproteins. The matrix is              
              important in calcification, and in crystal formation and                       
              regulation. Invertebrates are good systems to study calcification.             
              This project uses an octocoral, a colonial cnidaria commonly known             
              as a sea whip, which forms microscopic spicules of calcium                     
              carbonate crystals associated with a matrix. The colonies are large            
              enough to provide a sufficient amount of organic matrix for                    
              biochemical analysis and isolation of antigens for antibody                    
              preparation. This organism is an excellent system to probe the                 
              mechanisms of biomineralization.
