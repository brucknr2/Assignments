Abstract    :
              The principal investigator, in collaboration with Dr. James Beard              
              of the Virginia Museum of Natural History, will investigate the                
              melting of metamorphic rocks that contain the minerals biotite and             
              hornblende. Their experiments, to be conducted over a wide range               
              of pressure, will provide geologists with important information                
              regarding the generation of magmas within the earth's crust.
