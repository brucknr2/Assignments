Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Vitamin D helps the body use calcium and phosphorus in bones,                  
              nerves, and muscles.  However, vitamin D must be activated in the              
              kidney before it can work in the body.  One of the factors which               
              helps the kidney to activate vitamin D is parathyroid hormone.                 
              This grant will study the details of how parathyroid hormone                   
              stimulates the kidney to activate vitamin D.  To study this, we                
              will use rats, slices of rat kidney, and cells taken from the rat              
              kidney and grown outside the rat.  These studies may help to treat             
              people who have diabetes and people who are elderly.  In these                 
              people, parathyroid hormone may not stimulate the kidney to                    
              activate vitamin D, and lack of activated vitamin D may contribute             
              to bone disease.
