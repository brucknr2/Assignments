Abstract    :
              Recent work from deep sea (Ocean Drilling Project) records around              
              the Antarctic continent has shown that there were one or more                  
              brief, extremely warm, paleoclimatic events in the Pliocene.                   
              This award supports a micropaleontological study of the deep sea               
              sediment record from the South Ocean to identify Pliocene warm                 
              events in the southern high latitudes.  Using microfossil                      
              assemblages (diatoms and coccoliths) the work will determine the               
              temporal and spatial extent of these warm episodes and estimate                
              the summer temperature for such time intervals.
