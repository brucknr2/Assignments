Abstract    :
              It is proposed to develop ultraviolet laser                                    
              induced conductivity into a viable technology                                  
              for the semiconductor industry, and to                                         
              investigate the mechanisms for these large                                     
              conductivity increases in organic materials.  An                               
              investigation of the crucial laser and materials                               
              parameters necessary to optimize laser induced                                 
              conductivity in polymers will be undertaken.                                   
              Initially, a hierarchy of simply devices such as                               
              resistors and vias will be fabricated by direct                                
              laser irradiation of polymers.  Later, integrated                              
              structures such as ROM's are of interest.  A                                   
              technique has been developed to produce sub                                    
              100 nm lines in polyamide by direct laser                                      
              patterning.  It is proposed to investigate the                                 
              electrical properties of such structures.
