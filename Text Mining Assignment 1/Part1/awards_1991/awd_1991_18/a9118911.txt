Abstract    :
              In recent years evidence has been accumulating that many                       
              enzymes proceed through radical mechanisms.  Most reactions                    
              involve redox cofactors for which radical intermediates are                    
              plausible based on model studies of cofactor chemistry.  New                   
              types of mechanisms have been proposed recently involving                      
              radicals on amino acid side chains.  Although there has been                   
              much compelling indirect evidence consistent with H-atom                       
              abstraction from substrates by protein-derived radicals, to                    
              date there has been no direct evidence.  Galactose oxidase from                
              the fungus Dactylium dendroides catalyzes the oxidation of                     
              primary alcohols with O2, producing aldehydes and H2O2.  Based                 
              on recent EPR, resonance Raman, and X-ray crystallographic                     
              structural information and on extensive preliminary studies                    
              with mechanism-based inactivating substrate analogs, a new                     
              mechanism for galactose oxidase catalysis is proposed featuring                
              rate-determining H-atom abstraction by a tyrosine radical from                 
              the alcohol CH2.  The reaction mechanism of galactose oxidase                  
              catalysis will be studied in the proposal research.  The                       
              resulting detailed reaction mechanism should become a paradigm                 
              for substrate activation using protein-centered radicals for H-                
              atom abstraction from substrates.  Such fundamental information                
              will be useful in understanding more biomedically relevant                     
              enzymes, such as ribonucleotide reductases, which are more                     
              difficult to study due to stringent substrate specificities.
