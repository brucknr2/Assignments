Abstract    :
              In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the                       
              Chemistry Division, George Flynn of Columbia University will                   
              use high resolution infrared diode laser absorption techniques                 
              to study four dynamical processes.  Included in these                          
              experiments are the study of energy flow from individual                       
              quantum states of highly vibrationally excited molecules to                    
              acceptor collision partners; the quenching of electronically                   
              excited molecules with unpaired spins, with emphasis on the                    
              quantum states in which the acceptor molecules are left;                       
              reaction dynamics involving hot atom reagents; and non-reactive                
              hot-atom collision processes which produce vibrationally                       
              excited collision partners.

              Experimental studies of chemical reactions and relaxation                      
              phenomena involving electronic, vibrational, and rotational                    
              energies of molecular systems are important to scientists                      
              examining the energy transfer mechanisms and chemical                          
              reactivity of relatively complex species.  Many biochemists,                   
              chemists, and physicists are interested in a detailed                          
              understanding of energy exchange in order to understand how                    
              chemical reactions occur as well as what causes a system                       
              undergoing collision to react rather than transfer any excess                  
              internal energy.  These experiments should help elucidate the                  
              fundamental forces which control reactive and nonreactive                      
              collision processes.
