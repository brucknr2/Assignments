Abstract    :
              This award supports a paleomagnetic study of East Antarctica                   
              where early Paleozoic reference poles are not well                             
              established.  The investigation will provide new poles from                    
              South Victoria Land (SVL) in cratonic East Antarctica for                      
              the time period between 550 and 450 million years ago, (the                    
              Early Cambrian to the Late Ordovician).  New paleomagnetic                     
              data from East Antarctic Cambrian and Ordovician rocks will                    
              constrain the early Paleozoic Gondwana apparent polar wander                   
              path and increase our understanding of East Antarctic's                        
              early paleozoic tectonic evolution.
