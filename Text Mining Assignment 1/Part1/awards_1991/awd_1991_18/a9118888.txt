Abstract    :
              Description: This project supports research to be conducted by an              
              Indian team led by Dr.Lali Chatterjee of the Physics Dept. of                  
              Jadavpur University in Calcutta and a team led by Dr. Thornton                 
              Murphy of Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory.  The Indian                   
              scientists will participate on Fermilab Experiments 782 and 802.               
              In E782, a study of muon interactions in a bubble chamber, two                 
              scientists from India, Drs. Chatterjee and Gosh will participate               
              with several U.S. and foreign institutions.  In E802, a study of               
              muon interactions in emulsion, the Jadavpur team has been                      
              approved by Fermilab as the sole investigator.  The visits by the              
              Indian scientists to Fermilab will cover three phases: planning                
              the emulsion exposure, exposing the stack, and establishing                    
              bubble chamber scanning criteria and efficiencies to assure                    
              consistency of film scanning in Calcutta.                                      
                                                                                             
              Scope:  This project represents a strong collaborative effort in               
              experiments that require efforts and inputs from scientists from               
              several countries utilizing major U.S. facilities and unique                   
              experimental opportunities.  The collaboration will be beneficial              
              to both the U.S. and the Indian scientists.
