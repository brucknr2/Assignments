Abstract    :
              This award is for support of a one year project to study the                   
              micropaleontologic character (diatoms, foraminifera, and other                 
              microfossils) of sub-glacial sediments from beneath ice stream B,              
              as part of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) program.  The                   
              sediments to be studied were obtained by Barclay Kamb as part of               
              his drilling program on Ice Stream B during the 1991/1992                      
              Antarctic field season.  The objectives of this study are to: 1)               
              identify Pleistocene and Pliocene episodes of West Antarctic ice               
              sheet glaciation, 2) evaluate deglacial and preglacial                         
              environments in West Antarctica, 3) evaluate sediment provenance               
              and glacial mixing, 4) test models of rapid ice stream flow (sub-              
              ice till deformation or basal sliding), and 5) provide base-line               
              geologic and chronostratigraphic data as an aid to geophysical                 
              interpretations.
