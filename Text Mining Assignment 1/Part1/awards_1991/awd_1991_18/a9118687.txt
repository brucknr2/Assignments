Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to develop the ability to predict the              
              folding/unfolding behavior of proteins based upon structural                   
              information.  The physical basis of two fundamental properties of              
              proteins will be addressed, the stability of the native                        
              conformation and the cooperativity of the folding/unfolding                    
              transition.  At the present time, the structure of over five                   
              hundred proteins has been determined; also, the thermodynamics of              
              the folding/unfolding behavior of a significant number of                      
              proteins has been studied in great detail by high sensitivity                  
              calorimetric techniques.  Unfortunately, the relationships                     
              between protein structure and protein folding behavior are not                 
              yet understood at a quantitative level.

              Understanding the forces and mechanisms that control how proteins              
              fold into their functional structures will significantly advance               
              our knowledge of biological organization at the molecular level.               
              From a practical point of view, the success of this research                   
              program will provide a quantitative conceptual framework to                    
              improve strategies for the rational design of proteins with                    
              specific stability and cooperative properties.
