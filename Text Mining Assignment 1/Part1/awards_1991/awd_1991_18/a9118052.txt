Abstract    :
              Solid-State Excimer Formation and Transportation - A theoretical               
              study of the long-standing problem of solid-state excimer formation            
              in a range of molecular crystals is proposed.  An excimer is an                
              electronic excitation of two molecules bound together only in the              
              excited state.  Formation, transport, and annihilation of these                
              entities will be studied in this program.  The goal of this work is            
              the unification of the vast existing experimental database under a             
              single theoretical umbrella.  This proposal will be cofunded by                
              DMR-Materials Theory (65%) and CHE (35%).

              The interaction of light with matter has been the basis for a wide             
              range of useful devices, ranging from lasers and solar cells to                
              windows and binoculars.  Among the various paths known for such                
              interaction, the exciton is perhaps the least well understood at               
              this time.  This project is intended to put our understanding of               
              excitonic interactions on a firm foundation.  Such a foundation in             
              clearly needed to develop further understanding of this unique form            
              of solid-state excitation.  This proposal will be cofunded by DMR-
