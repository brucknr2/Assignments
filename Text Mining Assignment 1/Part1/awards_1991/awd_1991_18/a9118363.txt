Abstract    :
              The overall goal of the project is to develop an ecosystem level               
              understanding of the rates and pathways of carbon, nitrogen,                   
              sulfur and water cycling within an Antarctic dry valley lake,                  
              Lake Fryxell, and to develop a quantitative conceptual model for               
              the system for comparison to similar ecosystems.  Understanding                
              the processes controlling elemental cycling in this physically                 
              relatively simple amictic system will enhance an understanding                 
              not just of Antarctic lakes but of other aquatic systems,                      
              especially marine and estuarine sediment systems and stratified                
              water columns.                                                                 
                                                                                             
              The specific objectives are to determine the relative importance               
              of physical versus biological processes in controlling the                     
              composition and distribution of bio-active versus non-bioactive                
              gases in Antarctic dry valley lakes.  A determination will be                  
              made of the relative importance for system organic matter                      
              production of rates of water column versus algal mat                           
              photosynthesis and their relative contribution to the ecosystem                
              carbon cycle.  The overall annual rate of organic matter                       
              decomposition within the lake ecosystem will be estimated.  The                
              final synthesis of data collected in this project will be a model              
              of carbon balance for Lake Fryxell.
