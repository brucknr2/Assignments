Abstract    :
                   The PI will carry out a series of laboratory experiments on               
              thermal convection in two superposed fluid layers with different               
              densities and viscosities.  The density and viscosity of the                   
              working fluid will be controlled by varying the concentrations                 
              respectively of salt and cellulose (Natrosol) in aqueous solution.             
              The most important advantage of this technique is that the density             
              and viscosity can be varied independently, which was not possible              
              in previous experimental studies.  The primary goals of the                    
              experiments are (1) to determine the conditions under which thermal            
              and mechanical coupling between the layers occurs,a nd (2) to                  
              derive scaling laws for quantities (e.g., Nusselt number and mixing            
              rate) which describes the global evolution of the system.
