Abstract    :
                   Synextensional sedimentary deposits provide an important                  
              record of the Earth's surface response to crustal stretching.  This            
              project will use the synextensional sedimentary rocks of the                   
              Colorado River extensional corridor to evaluate three recently                 
              proposed models for detachment (extensional) fault evolution, and              
              to determine fault separation and paleogeography of the region.                
              The results will have important implications for continental                   
              extensional tectonics.
