Abstract    :
              The objective of the proposed analytical research is to develop a              
              technical basis for predicting the limit of dynamic stability of               
              drill bits used in various earth boring operations. The                        
              investigation will incorporate the combined effects of axial,                  
              torsional and lateral modes in the analysis of bit motion and in               
              the determination of the limit of dynamic stability. A study of                
              the effects of mode coupling will show which modes of vibration                
              are critical and lead to practical methods of changing the                     
              structural stability of the drilling system. The knowledge gained              
              from this research will provide a technical guidance for reducing              
              drillstring failures and increasing penetration rate.
