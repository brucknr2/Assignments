Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Research will focus on the biochemical and molecular mechanisms by             
              which the marine copepod Tigriopus californicus responds to changes            
              in environmental salinity. This species, like many others, is known            
              to accumulate high intracellular concentrations of proline, a non-             
              essential amino acid. The mechanisms regulating proline synthesis              
              in response to osmotic stress in higher organisms remain to be                 
              determined. Previous work has shown that one regulatory site for               
              induction of proline synthesis lies within the first two steps of              
              the pathway between glutamate and proline; the current work will               
              concentrate on this pathway. The goals of the proposed work are to             
              elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying this regulation and              
              to determine why such regulation fails among some interpopulation              
              hybrids.                                                                       
              Primary objectives are: (1) to isolate (clone) the genes encoding              
              the first two enzymes in the proline synthesis pathway, (2) to                 
              determine the normal pattern of regulation of these genes during               
              osmotic response, (3) to screen interpopulation hybrid lines for               
              aberrant regulation of proline synthesis at the biochemical level,             
              and (4) to use the cloned genes as probes for determining the                  
              mechanism underlying hybrid breakdown in proline synthesis.
