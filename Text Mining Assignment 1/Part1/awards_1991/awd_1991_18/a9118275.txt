Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal targets the hormonal bases of insect egg development             
              and subsequent maternal behavior. Insects have been widely used as             
              model systems to study basic mechanisms of hormone action, and in              
              the isolation and identification of key regulatory proteins that               
              hold promise in the development of biorational pesticides. This                
              investigations utilizes the ring-legged earwig. Anisolabis                     
              annulipes. This relatively primitive insect is an excellent model              
              system for investigating the hormonal regulation of egg development            
              and reproductive behaviors because it exhibits discrete cycles of              
              ovarian development, pronounced maternal behavior, precisely timed             
              juvenile dispersal.                                                            
              My specific goals are to investigate: (1) the biochemical identity             
              of juvenile hormone, a primary reproductive hormone produce by                 
              corpora allata, an essential step to future experiments; (2) the               
              hormonal basis of maternal care and the degree to which it is                  
              coupled to the cycle of egg development by manipulation of levels              
              of hemolymph (blood) proteins that specifically degrade juvenile               
              establishment of a direct method for determining rates of juvenile             
              hormone synthesis, and subsequently determining the effects of                 
              hormone application and of denervation of corpora allata on                    
              juvenile hormone production. The final stage of the investigation              
              will be to pursue stimulatory/inhibitory effects of the brain on               
              corpus allatum activity.
