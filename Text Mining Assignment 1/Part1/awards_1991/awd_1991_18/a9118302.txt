Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Two approaches are proposed to investigate substrate specificity               
              and catalytic mechanisms of two different enzymes, citrate synthase            
              (CS) and serine carboxypeptidase (CPD).  The first will be an X-ray            
              crystallographic analysis of the structures of the enzymes and to              
              compare ligand affinities and catalytic activity of related or                 
              mutant forms of the enzymes.  The second will be to investigate the            
              role of electrostatic fields in the mechanisms by use of                       
              theoretical calculations.                                                      
                                                                                             
              Citrate synthase is one of few enzymes capable of directly forming             
              a carbon bond.   A detailed mechanism for part of the reaction has             
              been proposed.  Site-directed mutants of CS with differing activity            
              have been constructed.  Their structures will be analyzed by                   
              crystallographic techniques, enzyme kinetics and electrostatic                 
              field calculations to study the roles of selected side chains.                 
                                                                                             
              Serine carboxypeptidases are highly specific proteinases which are             
              essential for the maturation of peptide hormones.  They are                    
              unrelated to other serine proteinases, but have the same active                
              site groups.  Analysis of inhibitor binding will determine the                 
              basis for substrate specificity.  Selected mutants of yeast CPD                
              will be studied to determine the basis for the unusual pH                      
              dependence of the reaction and to test whether the enzymatic                   
              mechanism is similar to that proposed for other serine proteinases.
