Abstract    :
              The Diels-Alder reaction is one of the most powerful                           
              carbon-carbon bond forming reactions in chemistry, generating                  
              as many as four stereocenters in a single step. A U-shaped                     
              template will be developed bearing 2,6-di(acylamino)pyridine                   
              and carboxylic acid groups to simultaneously bind maleimide and                
              dienes bearing pendant amino groups in an appropriate                          
              orientation for Diels-Alder reaction. By means of                              
              enthalpic(hydrogen bonding) and entropic(proximity) effects,                   
              the template is anticipated to catalyze the Diels-Alder                        
              reaction while controlling the stereo- and regioselectivity.                   
              The goals of the research include control of the                               
              regioselectivity of reaction of substituted cyclopentadienes,                  
              inversion of the natural endo-selectivity of the Diels-Alder                   
              reaction, and achievement of enantioselectivity.  Emphasis will                
              be placed upon the development of strategies to overcome                       
              product inhibition interactions.

              This award is the starter grant increment of Dr. Nowick's                      
              Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Chemistry in support of his                
              research at the University of California at Irvine. The main                   
              thrust of Dr. Nowick's research is the development of a                        
              template catalyst to bind suitable diene and dienophile                        
              components and catalyze regio-, stereo-, and enantioselective                  
              Diels-Alder reactions.
