Abstract    :
              A structural investigation by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)                 
              spectroscopy of RNA-protein interactions will be carried out.                  
              These interactions are poorly understood, and their importance in              
              areas such as RNA processing and RNA viruses is rapidly becoming               
              appreciated.  The systems to be studied include the prokaryotic                
              ribosome, the eukaryotic spliceosome and the regulation of                     
              transcription in bacteriophage T4.  In the ribosome and                        
              spliceosome, specific RNA-protein interactions are crucial to                  
              structure and function, and components of each including                       
              individual proteins, RNA fragments and complexes will be isolated              
              and studied.  In addition, the structure of the putative DNA-                  
              binding domain of a vital protein that controls transcription in               
              bacteriophage T4 will be determined.                                           
              %%%                                                                            
              Interactions between proteins and nucleic acids are central to                 
              many cellular processes and the results of this research will                  
              provide important insights into the mechanisms by which proteins               
              recognize specific nucleic acid sequences.
