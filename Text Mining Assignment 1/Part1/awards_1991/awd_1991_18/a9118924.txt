Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The experiments proposed involve Taylor-Couette flow in superfluid             
              helium, mutual-friction coefficients at elevated pressures and a               
              study of the interactions of elementary excitations with each other            
              and with quantized vortices.                                                   
                                                                                             
              A major objective of the work is to lay a solid foundation for                 
              understanding the hydrodynamics of superfluid He flowing at very               
              high Reynolds numbers.
