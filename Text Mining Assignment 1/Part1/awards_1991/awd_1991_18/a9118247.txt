Abstract    :
                This project focuses on the transport pathway from the                       
              endoplasmic reticulum to the lysosomal membrane. A family of                   
              recently characterized lysosomal membrane glycoproteins ("lgp's")              
              and their cDNAs will be used to study the molecular requirements               
              for transport to, and maintenance in, the limiting membranes of                
              these terminal degradative compartments.  Site-directed                        
              mutagenesis and expression of the cDNAs in cultured cells will be              
              used to define targeting features of lgp's, while antisense RNA                
              expression will be used to explore functions.  The apparent                    
              mistargeting of overexpressed lgp's will be studied to further                 
              elucidate the regulation of this pathway.  Additional components               
              of the lysosomal membrane will be characterized to search for                  
              common targeting features, as well as to further define and                    
              understand this dynamic organelle.                                             
                                                                                             
              Membranes of eukaryotic cells define a diverse set of                          
              intracellular compartments that are functionally and                           
              biochemically distinct.  Proteins that span or cross membranes                 
              are transported from their points of synthesis to their                        
              appropriate sites of action, often traversing multiple organellar              
              compartments along the way.  Proteins must therefore possess                   
              features that are not only essential for their functions, but                  
              also essential for transport and targeting to their final                      
              destinations.  To date, few of the latter features have been                   
              defined.  The results of this project will increase our                        
              understanding in this fundamental area of cell biology.
