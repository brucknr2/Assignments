Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The long term objective of the research being proposed is to                   
              provide a molecular description of primary events leading to the               
              onset of differentiation in mammalian cells. Specifically, this                
              research will focus on providing a detailed description of the                 
              mechanism of action of the protein Id, a molecule shown to                     
              inhibit the differentiation process in multiple cell lineages.                 
              The main model system that will be sued to study Id activity is                
              the muscle differentiation pathway in which Id has been shown to               
              antagonize the action of the muscle determination gene MyoD. 1)                
              The regions of the Id protein molecule required for its activity               
              will be determined by site directed mutagenesis followed by                    
              functional analysis in transfection assays. Both the ability of                
              Id to inhibit myogenesis and its ability to overcome the growth                
              suppressive properties of MyoD will be investigated in these                   
              studies. 2) The Id gene will be isolated from a mouse genomic                  
              library and the enhancer elements responsible for its regulated                
              expression during differentiation will be identified by deletion               
              analysis, transient transfections and the use of transgenic mice.              
              3) Inducible versions of the Id gene will be constructed to                    
              determine the phenotype of timed over expression of Id in                      
              cultured cells and transgenic mice.
