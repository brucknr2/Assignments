Abstract    :
              The specific objective for the research is to identify sequence and            
              structural features of the phytochrome A molecule involved in its              
              regulatory action.  During this period the focus on the use of                 
              overexpreession of mutagenized phytochrome A in trangenic                      
              Arabidopsis to identify functionally important residues.  This                 
              focus will capitalize on the recently developed transgenic                     
              Arabidopsis system which provides an easily scorable hypocotyl                 
              length phenotype for loss of function in the mutagenized                       
              polypeptide.                                                                   
              %%%                                                                            
              The significance of this research is that it will help define the              
              mechanism by which the regulatory master switch, phytochrome,                  
              controls plant gene expression in response to light.
