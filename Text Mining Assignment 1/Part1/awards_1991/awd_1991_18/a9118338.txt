Abstract    :
              The principal investigator will develop and implement computerized             
              X-ray tomography and automated petrographic image analysis. This               
              will aid in the analysis of porphyroblast distribution, patterns               
              of compositional zoning, and crystal size distributions in rocks.              
              The work will help geologists relate two-dimensional analysis to               
              a larger three-dimensional framework. It also will help establish              
              the relative importance of possible reaction mechanisms and kinetic            
              controls on crystallization in diverse metamorphic environments.
