Abstract    :
              The principal investigator will (1) evaluate the budget of the rare            
              earth elements, as well as U and Th, in the Wepawaug Schist of                 
              south central Connecticut, and (2) develop techniques for precisely            
              determining the prograde temperature-pressure-time history of                  
              pelitic metamorphic rocks. This work will help constrain the                   
              absolute time of formation of important minerals, and in turn give             
              geologists critical information needed to interpret rock ages and              
              geologic events.
