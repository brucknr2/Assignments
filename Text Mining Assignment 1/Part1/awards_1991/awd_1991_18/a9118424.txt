Abstract    :
              This is research will place a newly developed instrument on an                 
              Office of Naval Research sponsored marine mooring to measure sea-              
              ice draft, as a method of determining sea-ice thickness, in the                
              Arctic Ocean over the Chukchi Continental Shelf.  Time-series                  
              measurements will be obtained on sea-ice draft distribution over               
              a one-year period at a single location.  These data will be                    
              analyzed together with a similar time series measured at a second              
              location approximately 100 km away, to determine the spatial and               
              temporal coherence of sea-ice draft and the ice-draft distribution.            
              The quasi-permanent sea-ice cover of the Arctic Ocean is a central             
              component of the northern high latitude climate system, and secular            
              changes in the concentration and thickness of the sea ice can be               
              important proxy indicators of wide-spread arctic climate                       
              variations.
