Abstract    :
              The principal investigator will investigate the interaction of                 
              grain boundary fluids and fluid inclusions during the progressive              
              deformation of quartz-dominated rocks and veins from the Simplon               
              fault zone of Switzerland and Italy. The goal of the study is to               
              determine to what degree deformation affects the chemical composi-             
              tions of fluid inclusions. These data are critical for meaningful              
              interpretations of fluid inclusion data from deformed rocks.
