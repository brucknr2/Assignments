Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                  The central goal of this project is to determine 129I/I and               
              36Cl/Cl ratios in fluids from the KTB pilot-hole (Vorbohrung).  This           
              project is a component of the international participation in the               
              scientific investigation of the super-deep borehole (Hauptbohrung)             
              of the Federal Republic of Germany.  The purpose of investigation              
              is to contribute partially to the international efforts for a                  
              better understanding of the petrogenesis, geochemical and isotopic             
              evolution of the segments of the continental crust as represented              
              in the KTB pilot-hole.  In particular, the principal investigators             
              will address the issues of residence time and sources of the fluids            
              encountered at 3.4 km depth.  The objectives of the study are in               
              complete agreement with the scientific goals of the KTB                        
              Hauptbohrung.
