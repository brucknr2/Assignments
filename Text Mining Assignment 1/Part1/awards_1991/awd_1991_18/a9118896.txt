Abstract    :
                   This Small Grant for Exploratory Research will support a                  
              reexamination of the roles and uses of statistical theory and                  
              methodology in the field of geophysics.  One objective is the                  
              identification and initial formulation of statistical theoretical              
              questions arising in paleomagnetism and in estimating fields of                
              distortion or motion.  A second objective is to identify needs                 
              for new statistical methodology or for substantial modification                
              and extension of existing methodology for specific kinds of                    
              analysis frequently presented by geophysicists in their research.
