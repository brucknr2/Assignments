Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Cotton and his group will continue their research on the                  
              analysis and numerical simulation of convective storms. They will              
              focus on multi-scale aspects (organization of convective cells into            
              lines and clusters, interaction with synoptic scale systems) and on            
              the genesis of severe weather events (flash floods, strong winds,              
              tornadoes). The work combines the use of an interactive, nested-               
              grid model, viz. CSU's Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (RAMS)             
              with analysis of data gathered by high-resolution observational                
              systems, including the CHILL-radar, a national research facility               
              housed at CSU. The linkage between modelling and observations                  
              provides iterative testing of hypotheses by numerical simulations,             
              validation and refinement of the models and objectively analysed               
              documentation of storms. This last function will depend on four                
              dimensional data assimalation procedures (4DDA) to be developed. A             
              significant element of the planned work lies in new developments in            
              the RAMS' physics and numerics.                                                
                                                                                             
                   Cotton's past record of productivity (in students and public-             
              ations) foreshadows a significant contribution toward meeting the              
              demands generated by the U.S. Weather Research Program, and the                
              national effort in weather system modernization over the next                  
              decade.
