Abstract    :
              A genetic analysis of homologous genetic recombination in the plant            
              Arabidopsis thaliana will be done. Mutants which are defective in              
              recombination or which have elevated levels of recombination will              
              be isolated. These mutants will be mapped and characterized by                 
              genetic analysis. The first immediate goal of this proposal is to              
              identify suitable marker systems for rapid, accurate measurement of            
              meiotic and mitotic recombination so that these methods may be used            
              to identify and characterize mutants. The second goal is to screen             
              an existing set of DNA repair deficient mutants as well as newly               
              mutagenized plants for individuals with abnormal recombination                 
              frequencies. The third goal is to characterize the relationship                
              between repair and recombination in Arabidopsis.                               
                                                                                             
              This work will establish a genetic system that will make a                     
              molecular analysis of recombination in plants become feasible.
