Abstract    :
                   In late June 1992, the Field Museum of Natural History, the               
              University of Illinois at Chicago and the University of Chicago                
              will host the Fifth North American Paleontological Convention                  
              (NAPC.V) under the auspices of the Association of North American               
              Paleontological Societies (ANAPS).  The primary objectives of                  
              NAPC.V are to :  i) encourage scientific and professional                      
              interactions between different subdisciplines in paleontology; ii)             
              provide improved opportunities for the participation of students               
              in major national and international meeting; iii) stimulate                    
              integration of paleontological expertise into research with biology            
              and geology in the broad sense.  NSF support will attain these                 
              objectives by:  i) partially covering the costs associated with the            
              participation of six plenary speakers from different subdisciplines            
              in paleontology in NAPC.V, as well as key paleontologists                      
              (especially junior faculty, students and participants from                     
              overseas) who are contributing to scheduled interdisciplinary                  
              symposia; and ii) subsidizing the participation of students                    
              (particularly women and minorities) in NAPC.V.
