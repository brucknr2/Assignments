Abstract    :
              In addition to its important role as a source of energy for                    
              photosynthesis, light plays an extremely important role in the                 
              regulation of plant development.  While much is known about the                
              phytochrome system, responsive to wavelengths at the red end of                
              the electromagnetic spectrum, little is known about photoreceptors             
              or their signal transduction chains at the blue end.  The                      
              investigator proposes to continue investigating a blue light                   
              mediated phosphorylation of a plasma membrane protein that is                  
              hypothesized to be involved in phototropism and perhaps other blue             
              light responses.  They plan to purify and characterize the protein             
              and other proteins which may interact with it in photoreception and            
              early signal transduction.  Studies of the system at the gene level            
              will be initiated by cloning and sequencing the genes encoding for             
              these proteins.  Elucidation of this system at the cell,                       
              biochemical and molecular levels should be a major step forward in             
              our understanding of how light regulates plant development.
