Abstract    :
                This research is for a cooperative project with Soviet                       
              scientists to conduct detailed seismic measurements at the Kola                
              super-deep borehole.  This project involves personnel from the                 
              Ministry of Geology of the USSR, the Institute for Physics of the              
              Earth of the USSR Academy of Sciences, the University of Wyoming,              
              the University of Glasgow, the University of Edinburgh, and the                
              University of Bergen.  Seismic data to be collected include a                  
              vertical-seismic profile in the borehole, a common-depth-point                 
              profile over more than 100 km, and a detailed refraction-                      
              reflection line using large shots for mantle as well as crustal                
              investigation.  The Soviets are to cover costs of data                         
              acquisition of over $2 million.  The results of the research will              
              be invaluable to interpretation of the numerous crustal seismic                
              studies ongoing throughout the world.
