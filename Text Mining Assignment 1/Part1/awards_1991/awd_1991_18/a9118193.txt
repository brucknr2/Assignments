Abstract    :
              This award will support a U.S.-Mexico scientific                               
              collaboration between Professor Jorge Jose of                                  
              Northeastern University and Professors G. Monsivais,                           
              E. Cota, and G. Ramirez of the Universidad Autonoma                            
              Nacional de Mexico (UNAM).  The main objective of                              
              the research is to study electronic and                                        
              superconducting properties of systems of restricted                            
              dimensionality.                                                                
                                                                                             
              The proposed study will be divided into two parts:                             
              1) transport in quasi-one dimensional electronic                               
              systems with and without interactions, disorder, and                           
              time-dependent potentials, and 2) studies of the                               
              metastable magnetic properties of random arrays of                             
              Josephson junctions as well as high temperature                                
              superconductors.  The proposed research will rely on                           
              the use of numerical simulation techniques, as well                            
              as analytic techniques, and will build on previous                             
              successful work of the collaborators.  This research                           
              is likely to lead to the development of new devices                            
              within the realm of mesoscopic quantum effect                                  
              electronics.
