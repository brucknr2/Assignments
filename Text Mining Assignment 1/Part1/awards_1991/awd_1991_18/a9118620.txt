Abstract    :
              This award supports a systematic study of new fossil vertebrates               
              collected in the Beardmore Glacier area of Antarctica.  Material               
              from the upper Fremouw Formation, that includes several new                    
              therapsids and temnospondyls, will be prepared.  The current                   
              project will also include the preparation, study and description               
              of a new assemblage of dinosaur fossils collected from the Falla               
              Formation.  These specimens are of particular importance becuase               
              they represent the only early dinosaurs (Late Triassic to Jurassic)            
              known from Antarctica and the only dinosaurs of any kind from the              
              Antarctic mainland.  They represent only the third terrestrial                 
              vertebrate fauna from the Transantarctic Mountains.
