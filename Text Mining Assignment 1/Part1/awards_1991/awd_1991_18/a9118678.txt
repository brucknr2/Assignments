Abstract    :
              This award is for support of a project to assess mechanisms of                 
              Antarctic ice-sheet and paleoclimatic evolution through the last               
              glacial cycle in the Ross Embayment.  Detailed examination of the              
              glacial geology and isotope chronology of carefully selected field             
              areas will be undertaken in order to test hypotheses of extensive              
              or limited grounded ice in the Ross Embayment at the last glacial              
              maximum.  Intergration of this geologic record with ice-core                   
              glaciochemistry from the McMurdo Dome core will produce the first              
              isotopically dated Antarctic paleoclimatic curve.  This information            
              will allow disentanglement of important paleoclimatic forcings of              
              ice sheet evolution, evaluation of hypotheses of ice-age climate               
              dynamics requiring rapid, synchronous global change, and tests of              
              the sensitivity of the West Antarctic ice sheet to climate change.
