Abstract    :
              The principal goal of this project is to characterize the                      
              chemical and kinetic mechanism of 4-methoxybenzoate                            
              monooxygenase (4MBMO).  This enzyme is an Fe-Rieske enzyme, a                  
              class of enzyme which plays a prominent role in biodegradation                 
              of aromatic species.  Extensive characterization will aid in                   
              designing strategies for use of bioremediation to remove                       
              hazardous chemicals from the environment. This work will also                  
              add to our understanding of the possible modes of oxygen                       
              activation.                                                                    
              %%%                                                                            
              This project will result in training both graduate                             
              and undergraduate students in biochemical analysis of                          
              environmental problems  In the course of this project, the                     
              students will be trained in the tools of enzymology,                           
              microbiology and physical biochemistry.  The laboratory                        
              experience of the undergraduate students(s) will be organized                  
              to train them to think critically about experimental design and                
              results and to educate them in the values and methods of                       
              science.  Graduate education in this program should train an                   
              individual to be an independent professional; one of our goals                 
              is to increase the pool of scientists trained to approach                      
              environmental and ecological questions on a molecular level.
