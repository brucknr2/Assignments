Abstract    :
                   This award will provide half the funds needed to acquire a                
              laser-ablation sampler for the inductively-coupled plasma mass                 
              spectrometer system installed in the Department of Geological                  
              Sciences at Cornell University. The addition of this laser device              
              will significantly enhance capabilities for trace element analysis.            
              Laser ablation provides the opportunity for microanalysis and in               
              situ analysis with excellent spatial resolution. This laser device             
              will be used in trace element partitioning studies in both natural             
              and experimental rock systems. Analytical studies of mantle and                
              crustal xenoliths are also planned.
