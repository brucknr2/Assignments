Abstract    :
              Cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) and disease susceptibility are                
              associated with a mitochondrial gene, T-urf13, which is carried by             
              the Texas male-sterile cytoplasm (cms-T) of maize.  T-urf13 encodes            
              a 13-kilodalton protein, URF13, which is located in the inner                  
              mitochondrial membrane.  The fungal pathogens, Bipolaris maydis                
              race T and Phyllosticta maydis, produce pathotoxins that are                   
              responsible for the virulence toward cms-T maize.  Mitochondria                
              from cms-T are specifically sensitive to the pathotoxins;                      
              sensitivity is caused by a toxin-URF13 interaction that mediates               
              pore formation in the inner mitochondrial membrane.  T-urf13 is                
              correlated with CMS by the molecular analysis of cms-T revertants              
              and the effects of fertility restoration.                                      
                                                                                             
              Nuclear and mitochondrial transformation experiments are proposed              
              to test the relationship between T-urf13 and CMS.  Standard and                
              mutated URF13s are used to study their effects on CMS and to                   
              determine the structural elements of URF13 relevant to CMS.  The               
              effects of URF13 mutation on CMS and toxin sensitivity are compared            
              to determine if the two traits rely on a common structure and                  
              mechanism.  A maize mitochondrial transformation system is proposed            
              that is based on the toxin-sensitivity response of T-urf13 and                 
              particle bombardment.  The pathotoxin-URF13 interaction will be                
              investigated to learn how URF13 forms a membrane pore.***//
