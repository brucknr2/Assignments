Abstract    :
              Scorpion venoms are complex mixtures that contain a large number of            
              small basic proteins.  These neurotoxins interact with the sodium              
              channels of excitable membranes to enhance the inward sodium                   
              current and to delay sodium current inactivation.  Their toxic                 
              effects are a consequence of the depolarization of receptive cells.            
              The present investigation is part of a continuing multidisciplinary            
              program to elucidate the structure-function relationships of                   
              various toxins derived form the venom of the scorpion Centruroides             
              sculpturatus Ewing (CsE).  Using NMR spectroscopy in combination               
              with distance geometry and molecular mechanics refinement methods,             
              the solution structures of various homologous toxins from CsE will             
              be determined.  These studies will test a number of hypotheses                 
              related to the proposed structure-function relationships among                 
              these neurotoxins.  These studies will also be extended to some                
              purified toxins from the venom of L. quinquestriatus for which                 
              detailed information about receptor binding sites is now becoming              
              available.  These studies will provide the background information              
              necessary for the use of neurotoxins as structural probes of sodium            
              channels in biomembranes.
