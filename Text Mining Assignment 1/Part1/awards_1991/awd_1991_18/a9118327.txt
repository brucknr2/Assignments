Abstract    :
              The objective of this award is to examine the                                  
              relationship between chromatin structure and gene activity in                  
              higher eukaryotes.  Studies on basal and regulated                             
              transcription by RNA polymerase II have generally focussed upon                
              the identification and characterization of promoter-and                        
              enhancer-binding proteins with naked DNA templates.  Recent                    
              findings on the mechanism of transcriptional activation by                     
              these sequence specific factors strongly suggest that dynamic                  
              interactions between chromatin and the transcription factors                   
              are involve in the regulation of gene expression.  For                         
              instance, it has been found that these transcriptional                         
              "activators" may actually function as antirepressors--that is                  
              they appear, at least in part, to counteract repression of                     
              basal transcription by chromatin.  In this award the                           
              working hypothesis is that there are key interactions between                  
              transcription factors and components of chromatin in the                       
              course of activation and repression of gene activity.  Two                     
              different systems for reconstitution of chromatin will be                      
              developed, and then the resulting chromatin will be used as                    
              template for in vitro transcription analysis .  These studies                  
              should lead to a better understanding of the process of gene                   
              activation and should eventually be applied to the molecular                   
              analysis of diseases involving improper expression of genes,                   
              such as some forms of cancer.
