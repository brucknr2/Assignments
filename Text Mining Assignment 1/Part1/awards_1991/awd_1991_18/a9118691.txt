Abstract    :
                   This study builds on new developments in the analysis of very             
              small amounts of Rb/Sr isotopes in garnets.  The new technique will            
              be applied to two field areas where substantial geological and                 
              petrological information is available, in order to determine high-             
              precision pressure-temperature-time paths for the rocks.  The study            
              constitutes the first field-tests for this technique and is                    
              essential for verification of its applicability to tectonic                    
              problems.  The results will have profound implications for tectonic            
              and metamorphic rate calculations from a wide variety of tectonic              
              environments.
