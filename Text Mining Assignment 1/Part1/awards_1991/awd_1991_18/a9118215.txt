Abstract    :
              Regulation of differential mRNA stability is an important control              
              step in plastid gene expression.  Dr. Gruissem has shown that                  
              ribosome association and structures in the mRNA are important                  
              determinants for the decay of chloroplast mRNAs.  Inverted repeat              
              sequences (IR-RNAs) in the 3' untranslated region of chloroplast               
              mRNAs function as cis-regulatory determinants for mRNA 3' end                  
              processing and stability , and interact with RNA-binding proteins.             
              Three of the RNA-binding proteins have been purified and sequenced             
              and the gene for the proteins has been cloned.  Two RNA-binding                
              proteins have been identified and partially purified that                      
              specifically interact with the 3' IR-RNA of one mRNA.  It is                   
              proposed to continue the functional analysis of the RNA-binding                
              proteins in chloroplast mRNA metabolism and stability using in                 
              vitro reconstituted systems, and by genetic interference of the                
              expression of their genes in Arabidopsis.  A biochemical and                   
              molecular approach is presented to determine how ribosome                      
              association contributes to the different half-lives of chloroplast             
              mRNAs.                                                                         
              %%%                                                                            
              Dissection of the molecular mechanisms by which chloroplast                    
              mRNA stability is accomplished will provide novel and general                  
              information about the nuclear control of organelle gene expression.            
              Regulation of mRNA processing and stability is an important                    
              mechanism in control of gene expression in virtually all organisms.            
              Despite the wide-spread occurrence of mRNA stability control, our              
              understanding of this type of regulation is still cryptic and                  
              incomplete.//
