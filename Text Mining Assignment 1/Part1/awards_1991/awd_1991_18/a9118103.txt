Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Vitellin (Vt) is a phosphoglycolipoprotein which serves as the                 
              primary nutritive source for the insect embryo.  Following uptake              
              into the oocyte, Vt is stored in yolk granules, variably processed             
              and finally degraded in a controlled manner during embryo                      
              development.  The mechanisms responsible for initiating and timing             
              Vt breakdown are unknown.  Previous work from this laboratory with             
              Blattella germanica identified a processing proteinase involved in             
              Vt degradation and showed that its activation in vivo is correlated            
              temporally with the acidification of the yolk granules and changes             
              in their size.  Because these events may be interrelated                       
              physiologically in the regulation of Vt degradation, the following             
              studies will be carried out:  the identification of the mechanism              
              responsible for yolk granule acidification and how that mechanism              
              is activated, the purification and characterization of the                     
              processing proteinase, and the investigation of vitellophage and               
              yolk granule morphology during early embryo development.
