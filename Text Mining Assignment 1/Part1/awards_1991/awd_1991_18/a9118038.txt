Abstract    :
                This research will analyze recordings that were made by chance               
              from an IRIS network installed in the northern Caucasus which                  
              recorded the Ap?ril 29, 1991  Ms=7.2 Ossetian earthquake in the                
              Soviet Union.  Seven of the stations were transferred to the                   
              aftershock area by May 15 and recorded more than 500 events.                   
              This is a rare opportunity to study an intercontinental                        
              earthquake that is related to the continent-continent collision                
              of the Arabian and Eurasian plates.  This research is a component              
              of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
