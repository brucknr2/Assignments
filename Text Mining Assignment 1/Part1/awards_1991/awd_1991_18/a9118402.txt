Abstract    :
                   This award provides one-half the funds necessary for the                  
              acquisition of a used electron microprobe to be installed and                  
              operated in the Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary                
              Sciences at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. MIT is                  
              committed to providing the remaining funds needed for this                     
              acquisition. The instrument was not used much by its previous                  
              owner, the Polaroid Corporation, is in excellent condition, and is             
              expected to provide the analytical capabilities needed for a                   
              fraction of the cost of a comparable new instrument.                           
                   The microanalytical capabilities of the probe will be used                
              primarily by researchers at MIT and at the Woods Hole Oceanographic            
              Institution to analyze geological samples.
