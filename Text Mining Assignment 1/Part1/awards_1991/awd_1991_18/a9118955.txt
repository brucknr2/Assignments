Abstract    :
              This project is aimed at helping bioprocess monitoring,                        
              control, and optimization by providing a novel technique                       
              for on-line process variable estimation and optimization.                      
              Fermentation kinetic models seldom include the influence                       
              of environmental factors, like pH and temperature.  The                        
              development of accurate quantitative models, which                             
              simulate how cells respond to various environmental                            
              changes, will help in better utilizing the chemical                            
              synthesis capabilities of cells.  The proposed method will                     
              use environmental and physiological information available                      
              from on-line sensors to estimate concentration of species                      
              in a bioreactor.  Based on these estimates, the                                
              optimization scheme will provide the best environmental                        
              conditions which will drive the cells to their maximum                         
              productivity.
