Abstract    :
                   This award provides funds to supplement support from the                  
              University of Minnesota for developing a laboratory facility for               
              lake-bottom cores at the Limnological Research Center (LRC),                   
              University of Minnesota. About half of this award will cover                   
              salaries of LRC personnel. The other half will be used to acquire              
              equipment for documenting, storing, and analyzing lake sediment                
              cores. The LRC facility addresses a need for a coordinated approach            
              to lacustrine core samples which are critical to the interpretation            
              of paleoclimatic variations during the immediate geological past.
