Abstract    :
              Southern South America provides a natural and almost continuous                
              transition from polar to temperate climatic settings.  The                     
              recovery of high resolution late Quaternary paleooceanographic                 
              and paleoclimatic records from the Chilean continental margin is               
              thus an essential step in establishing the temporal and physical               
              linkages between the oceanographic, atmospheric, and terrestrial               
              systems of the southern hemisphere.  This award addresses the                  
              late Quaternary marine record of marginal sediments of the                     
              Pacific rim of southern Chile.  High resolution biostratigraphic,              
              paleoecologic, paleooceanographic, and paleoclimatologic                       
              reconstructions will be accomplished through diatom, foramineral,              
              and mineralogic analyses of modern and late Quaternary sediments.              
              Comparing these results with paleoclimatic interpretations of                  
              terrestrial and ice core data will lead to a more comprehensive                
              understanding of the ocean-atmosphere-continent response to                    
              climate change.                                                                
                                                                                             
              The development of a high resolution late Quaternary climate                   
              record from southern Chile by this project is required for:  (1)               
              establishing the relationships in the timing and extent of late                
              Quaternary glacial/climatic fluctuations between the Antarctic                 
              Peninsula and South America and (2)  completing a regional                     
              framework of preliminary paleoclimatic studies, thereby leading                
              to detailed future research on the neoglacial history of southern              
              South America and the Antarctic Peninsula region.
