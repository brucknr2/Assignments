Abstract    :
              The long term goal is to understand gene regulation during                     
              development in plants.  The area on which the PI has chosen to                 
              focus his efforts is regulation of transcription, specially the                
              initiation step.  Assembly of the transcription complex is the                 
              first step at which regulation can occur.  In order to evaluate                
              events during the assembly process it was first necessary to                   
              isolate and purify several plant transcription factors (TFs),                  
              then to characterize them (wheat TFIIA and TFIID), and to                      
              establish a heterologous wheat/human in  vitro transcription                   
              system using the cauliflower mosaic (CaMV) 35S promoter.                       
              Objectives for the next funding period are:                                    
                   1.  Continued biochemical characterization of wheat TFIIA                 
                   2.  Continued biochemical characterization of wheat TFIID                 
                   3.  Enzymology of transcription using wheat TFIIA AND wheat               
                      TFIID
