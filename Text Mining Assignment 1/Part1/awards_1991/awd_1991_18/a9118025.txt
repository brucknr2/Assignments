Abstract    :
                This research is to continue gravity monitoring as part of an                
              earthquake hazards program in the Beijing region of China.  Gravity            
              is monitored by means of eight Geodynamics TRG-1 tidal gravimeters             
              installed at semi-permanent sites, and at a number of stations                 
              visited periodically with three LaCoste-Romberg Model G                        
              gravimeters.  The monitoring program was begun in 1981 as part of              
              the U.S./PRC Protocol on Earthquake Studies and has continued to               
              the present, thus forming a valuable continuous record exceeding               
              ten years.  Gravity  is related to elevation changes and subcrustal            
              mass movements that have been proposed to be a part of the process             
              of preparation for earthquakes.  This region surrounding Beijing               
              is designated by the PRC earthquake hazard program as one of high              
              probability for the next major earthquake in China.  This research             
              is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program             
              and the U.S./PRC Earthquake Studies Protocol.
