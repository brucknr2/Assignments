Abstract    :
              The principal investigator will study the source of fluids, the                
              length scales of compositional heterogeneties in the fluid, and the            
              timing of fluid-rock interaction within the Franciscan complex of              
              California, utilizing isotopic and other geochemical techniques.               
              The results of this work will bear on the role of fluids in                    
              subduction zones, as well as on the geologic history of North                  
              America.
