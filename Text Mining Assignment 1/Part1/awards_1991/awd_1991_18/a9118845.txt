Abstract    :
              This research will explore the reactivity and structural                       
              chemistry of tervalent nickel in coordination environments                     
              which are thought to mimic those found for nickel hydrogenase                  
              enzymes.  These enzymes are responsible for the reversible                     
              conversion of of hydrogen--an essential conversion in anaerobic                
              metabolism for both chemotrophic and phototrophic bacteria. The                
              coordination environment of the nickel site varies with                        
              different organisms. A consensus coordination sphere has 2-4                   
              nitrogen or oxygen donors and 1-3 sulphur or selenium donors                   
              around nickel. Stabilization of nickel in its tervalent                        
              oxidation state will be a significant synthetic challenge due                  
              to the propensity of these systems to degrade by disulfide                     
              formation and concomitant metal reduction. A new class of                      
              ligands based on triazacyclononane will be designed and                        
              synthesized to circumvent this problem. The incorporation of                   
              other metals in this unique coordination environment will also                 
              be investigated.                                                               
              %%%                                                                            
              This award is made as the starter grant increment of Dr. Daniel                
              Stack's Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Chemistry in                       
              support of his research at Stanford University. The thrust of                  
              Dr. Stack's research is the design, synthesis and                              
              characterization of analogs of nickel hydrogenases.
