Abstract    :
                   This research is designed to document a high-precision record             
              of terrestrial responses to the widespread and rapid                           
              ocean/atmosphere reorganization in and around the North Atlantic               
              Ocean during the Younger Dryas Chronozone of the last deglaciation             
              (11,000-10,000 years ago).  The chronology and rates of change in              
              vegetation and association climate during the Younger Dryas will               
              be documented for land areas adjacent to the late-glacial Loch                 
              Lomond ice sheet over the Scottish Highlands.  An AMS 14C chronology           
              of changing paleo-vegetation will be used to document the timing               
              of terrestrial biotic responses as a kind of bioassay for the rapid            
              reorganization of the North Atlantic.  In turn, lags in growth and             
              dissipation of the ice sheet will be determined and cross-                     
              calibrated with the climate record from Scotland, Ireland and the              
              North Atlantic.  Results of this work will define the boundary                 
              conditions needed to develop and test several numerical models of              
              growth and response of ice-sheet to major, abrupt, and transient               
              climate shifts of the past and future.  One such model of ice-sheet            
              dynamics will be developed and tested as part of the project.
