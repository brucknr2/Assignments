Abstract    :
                   This award provides funds to equip a new shock-wave research              
              facility to be installed in the Department of Geophysical Sciences             
              at the University of Chicago. Equipment covered by this award                  
              includes high-speed digital counters, pulse generators, high-speed             
              streak camera, pulsed xenon strobe, and an oscilloscope. The                   
              facility will be used in studies of the physical properties of                 
              crystalline and amorphous silicate materials under the pressure and            
              temperature range of the Earth's mantle. In particular, the first              
              application will be to determine the systematic dependence of the              
              equation of state of silicate liquids on their chemical                        
              composition. Such data are crucial to an understanding of the                  
              buoyancy of melts in the deep interior and the differentiation of              
              the Earth via magmatic processes during its history.
