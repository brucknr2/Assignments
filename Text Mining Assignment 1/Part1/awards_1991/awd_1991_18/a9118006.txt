Abstract    :
              The principal investigators will investigate mass transfer and                 
              veining processes associated with regional metamorphism of both                
              pelitic and basic rocks. They will focus specifically on the                   
              processes and length scales of mass transport during prograde                  
              metamorphism and subsequent uplift-related hydrothermal activity.              
              The PI's will attempt to establish the genetic links between                   
              metasomatism and mineral reactions, fluid and heat fluxes, volume              
              strains, and the thermal and baric evolution of orogenic belts                 
              during metamorphism.
