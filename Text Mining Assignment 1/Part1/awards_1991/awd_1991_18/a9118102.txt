Abstract    :
              Funds are requested for instrumentation necessary to establish the             
              fermentation protein of a complete Cell Culture Facility in the                
              Institute for Biological Research and Technology at the University             
              of South Carolina.  This facility will replace an unusable 28 L                
              fermenter, and will provide a wide range of fermentation services              
              to the University community.  The User Group includes faculty from             
              the Department of Chemistry and Biological Sciences, as well as the            
              College of Pharmacy and School of Medicine.  The scope of projects             
              to be supported by this instrumentation includes:  (1) studies on              
              the structure and function of hemeiron oxygenase enzymes; (2)                  
              mechanistic studies on thymidylate synthase; (3) studies on                    
              mammalian gene expression; (4) work on thymidylate synthase and                
              fluoropyrimidine resistance; (5) structure function studies on                 
              matrix vesicle annexins; (6) using selenium as a probe of                      
              structure/function of biomacromolecules; (7) examining physiology,             
              ecology, and evolution of bacterial functional group; (8) studies              
              of the genetics of coal solubiolization; (9) mechanism of gene                 
              regulation in Caulobacter; (10) structural studies of rat spermatid            
              transition protein 2; (11) examining the interaction of antitumor              
              agents azinomycin A and B with DNA; (12) mechanistic studies of                
              enolase; (13) cell division gene products of Bacillus subtilis;                
              (14) role of human papillomaviruses in the transformation of human             
              cells; (15) formation and role of pseudouridine in mRNA splicing               
              cofactors; (16) preclinical evaluation of a human recombinant alph             
              B/D hybrid interferon in therapy of hepatitis and papillomavirus               
              infections; and (17) integrins and their interaction with the                  
              extracellular matrix.
