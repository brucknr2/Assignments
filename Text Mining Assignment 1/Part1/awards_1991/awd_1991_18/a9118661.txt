Abstract    :
                   The long-term objective of this laboratory is to elucidate the            
              molecular mechanisms and the functional components involved in the             
              regulation of plant gene expression in response to environmental               
              stimuli. Comprehension of these sensory and response pathways is               
              essential for understanding the dynamic nature of plant                        
              development. The expression levels of five genes, the TCH genes of             
              Arabidopsis, are rapidly and sharply increased in response to                  
              diverse stimuli, such as rain, wind, touch, heat shock and                     
              darkness. Three of the TCH genes encode calmodulin-related                     
              proteins, suggesting roles for calcium ion and calmodulin in the               
              signal transduction pathways.                                                  
                                                                                             
              The focus of this work is to characterize the regulation of the                
              calmoduln-related TCH  genes in plants and cultured cells in                   
              response to diverse environmental stimuli. First, the transcription            
              initiation sites, intron/exon boundaries and polyadenylation sites             
              will be defined and the full-length cDNA sequences will be                     
              determined for the calmodulin-related TCH2 and 3 genes.                        
              Subsequently, the tissue- and developmental-specificity of TCH 2               
              and 3 mRNA accumulation in plants will be examined, with the                   
              emphasis on comparing the characteristics of the responses to                  
              different stimuli. The processes of habituation, desensitization               
              and recovery will be investigated using TCH mRNA accumulation as               
              an assay. Additionally, the regulation of TCH 2 and 3 gene                     
              expression by mechanical stress, heat shock and calcium ion will               
              be addressed using cultured root cells that are relatively                     
              homogeneous and easily manipulated. Because of the universal role              
              of calcium ion a second messenger in eukaryotic cells, elucidation             
              of the regulation of expression of genes that encode calcium ion               
              receptors will likely be relevant for the great variety of plant               
              and animal cells that transduce extracellular stimuli into calcium             
              signals.
