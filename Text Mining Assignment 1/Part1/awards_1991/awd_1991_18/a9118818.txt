Abstract    :
              The storage and relaxation processes of photoexcited charge                    
              carriers and persistent photoconductivity (PPC) in II-VI                       
              semiconductor alloys is to be investigated.  Detailed studies will             
              be made of PPC related critical phenomena, including phase                     
              transitions, conductivity noise, and charge carrier decay behavior             
              under different conditions.  It will explore the origin of PPC in              
              II-VI semiconductors and provide quantitative characterization of              
              PPC effects.  Studies of transport properties, including Coulomb               
              gap, hopping conduction, and structure of electron networks in the             
              PPC mode are proposed.  Potential applications of PPC in II-VI                 
              semiconductor alloys are discussed.
