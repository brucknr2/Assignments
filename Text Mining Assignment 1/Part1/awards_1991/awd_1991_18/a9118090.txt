Abstract    :
                This research is to use tomographic inversion to determine 3-                
              dimensional velocity in the crust and upper mantle beneath                     
              Alaska.  The area of highest seismic station density, and                      
              therefore resolution, is in the south-central portion of the                   
              state which has a high seismic activity.  The main source of data              
              will be from local earthquakes recorded by the Alaska Earthquake               
              Information Center which is a joint effort of the University of                
              Alaska and the U.S. Geological Survey.  Teleseismic arrival times              
              will also be used for large scale inversions that emphasize                    
              deeper structure that includes the subducting oceanic plate.                   
              This research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard                 
              Reduction Program.
