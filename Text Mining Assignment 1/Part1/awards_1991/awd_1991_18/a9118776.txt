Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Fundamental investigation of the physics of quantum confinement and            
              phase coherence, with emphasis on charge quantization and processes            
              related to preparation, passivation, and characterization of the               
              material properties of microcrystalline silicon in an amorphous                
              silicon dioxide matrix is being conducted.  The amorphous silicon              
              dioxide serves both as a large energy barrier for resonant                     
              tunneling, and for the passivation of electrically active interface            
              defects.  This material combination broadens the type of quantum               
              well structures from those requiring lattice matching of materials             
              with different band gaps to include an established materials system            
              that is not restrained by the lattice matching condition.  These               
              materials and their behavior are of interest from both basic                   
              science and technological perspectives.                                        
              %%%                                                                            
              This research is expected to broaden and extend our knowledge of               
              the properties and behavior of the primary materials used in                   
              microelectronics, silicon/silicon dioxide, and provide fundamental             
              understanding of quantum effects in microcrystalline structures.               
              From an application point of view, understanding these properties              
              will be helpful to semiconductor device design and fabrication, and            
              the fundamental research results will be of importance in a general            
              way to the technology of advanced integrated electronic circuits.
