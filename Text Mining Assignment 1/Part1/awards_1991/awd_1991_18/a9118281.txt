Abstract    :
              This is for continuation of a project to determine the preeruptive             
              distribution of gas in a large body of rhyolitic magma, the Bishop             
              Tuff.  First results of the PI's studies of melt inclusions and of             
              pumice formation pressure and vesicularity suggest that a                      
              surprisingly large excess of gas was present in preerupted Bishop              
              magma.  To definitely establish the amount of gas in the Bishop                
              magma the PIs plan comprehensive studies of individual pumice                  
              clasts from a selected set of old and new stratigraphically                    
              controlled sites.  They will determine the vesicle and crystal                 
              content of individual clasts of pumice as well as the compositions             
              of phenocrysts and the concentrations of H2O, CO2, Cl, Ba, U, Rb               
              and other elements in both enclosed and hourglass melt inclusions              
              in quartz and feldspar phenocrysts.  The work will result in the               
              first determination of the distribution of gas in a preeruptive                
              body of magma.  This data will then be used to test theories on gas            
              accumulation in magma bodies and its effect on the nature of                   
              volcanic eruptions.
