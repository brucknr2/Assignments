Abstract    :
                   This award provides funding for the acquisition, storage and              
              distribution of seismogram data at the Lamont-Doherty Geological               
              Observatory of Columbia University. The project will include                   
              collection of analog film chips of seismograms from the                        
              international Worldwide Seismographic Station Network and the                  
              development of new software for the distribution and analysis of               
              seismogram data. The data are an important archival source for much            
              research in earthquakes and seismic tomography and will be made                
              available rapidly and efficiently to a broad spectrum of U.S. and              
              international research seismologists.
