Abstract    :
                   This award will support instrumentation and operation of an               
              X-ray beamline dedicated to ultra-high pressure research at the                
              National Synchrotron Light Source at Brookhaven National                       
              Laboratory. The radiation source at the beamline is a                          
              superconducting wiggler insertion device which will generate                   
              intense high-energy polychromatic x-radiation, ideally suited for              
              the characterization of microsamples at ultra-high pressure and                
              elevated temperature inside a diamond-anvil cell (DAC).                        
                   Instrumentation development for the beamline will include a               
              new temperature measurement system to be used in conjunction with              
              laser heating of samples in the DAC to temperatures up to 5000K.               
              A cryogenic system will also be developed for use in low-                      
              temperature studies of condensed planetary ices and gases. Samples             
              to be studied include a wide variety of phases considered likely               
              candidates to form the interior of Earth and other planets. The                
              beamline facility will serve the needs of the high-pressure                    
              community in the geosciences and will be open to researchers in                
              this community as well as to materials scientists interested in                
              ultra-high pressure phenomena.
