Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The XVth International Conference on Magnetic Resonance in                     
              Biological Systems will be held in August, 1992 in Israel.                     
              Magnetic resonance spectroscopy is now one of the central                      
              techniques in biology and medicine.  Both ESR and NMR have provided            
              essential information on the structure-function relationships of               
              proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates and membranes.  Especially              
              noteworthy are the recent developments of NMR techniques for the               
              determination of the three-dimensional structure of proteins in                
              solution and the powerful combination of NMR with the methods of               
              in-vitro mutagenesis.  At the same time, one of the most exciting              
              recent advances has been the application of magnetic resonance                 
              methods to living organisms, providing for the first time a direct,            
              non-invasive monitor of biochemical events in selected, spatially              
              localized regions of living animals and humans.  The program                   
              planned will reflect this broad range of applications of magnetic              
              resonance spectroscopy.
