Abstract    :
              With this award the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic                
              Program continues its support of research by Dr. Daryle H.                     
              Busch of the Chemistry Department, University of Kansas,                       
              concerning the binding of O2 (dioxygen) to transition metal                    
              complexes.  The goal of the research is to control the                         
              conformation of iron(II) or cobalt(II) complexes and thus                      
              enable reversible dioxygen binding at a single site or at two                  
              or more correlated sites.  Tetradentate and pentadentate                       
              ligands which impose structural constraints will be used to                    
              iteratively synthesize complexes which may have the desired                    
              properties.  Specifically, the ligands tested will belong to                   
              one of six classes:  porphyrins, cyclidenes, alpha-dioximes, or                
              one of three types of macromolecules from the Schiff base                      
              family.  Measurements of equilibrium constants and rate                        
              constants for oxygen binding and autoxidation will be used to                  
              assess the affinity of the site for oxygen and determine the                   
              mechanism of oxidation by dioxygen.                                            
              %%%                                                                            
              Transition metal complexes which can bind and carry atmospheric                
              oxygen will be synthesized.  The shape of various groups                       
              attached to the metal will be varied in order to find ways to                  
              control the ease with which the oxygen molecule is attached and                
              released by the metal and to prevent the oxygen from reacting                  
              with the metal compounds.  The chemistry of these compounds is                 
              relevant to understanding the binding and transport of oxygen                  
              in respiring organisms and to the potential development of many                
              useful devices, such as fuel cells and sensors, and synthetic                  
              blood.
