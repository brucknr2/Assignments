Abstract    :
                   This award provides for one half the funds needed to upgrade              
              an inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrophotometer                
              (ICP-AES). The additional funding to make this acquisition possible            
              has been committed by Lehigh University. This upgraded instrument              
              forms an important component of expanding research and educational             
              programs in the recently reorganized and enlarged Department of                
              Earth and Environmental Sciences Lehigh. A large number of users               
              conducting research in diverse areas of geologic,geochemical, and              
              environmental study is planned.
