Abstract    :
                   Several contrasting models exist for the tectonic development             
              of the Himalayan and Tibetan Plateau.  Each of these models                    
              predicts different times for the initiation of crustal thickening,             
              differences in the rate or thickening, and different times for                 
              attainment of present crustal thickness.  However, none of the                 
              existing models predicts the inferred denudation event at 25 to 20             
              Ma.  This study will test the models and determine how widespread              
              was the denudation, using structural mapping and 40Ar/39Ar                     
              thermochronology along the Gangdese belt, and in the Yadong-Gulu               
              rift.  The thermochronology will also be combined with magneto-                
              stratigraphy on existing samples in order to fully test the models.            
              The results will provide a significant contribution to under-                  
              standing the tectonics of collisional and crustal thickening                   
              processes.
