Abstract    :
              Columbia University Theory Day isto be held twice a year at Columbia           
              University, once in the fall and once in the spring (1992-1994).  It           
              attracts 100-150 people mostly from the  New York City metropolitan            
              area.  Theory Days have two goals.  The first is to give an                    
              opportunity to theoretical computer scientists to meet.  The second is         
              to enable people outside of theory to learn about  new developments in         
              theoretical computer science.                                                  
                                                                                             
              The Department of Computer Science at Columbia University covered the          
              expense of Theory Day during the first five years, and the department          
              together with the National Science Foundation covered the expense in           
              the following four years.This award helps to cover the expenses of the         
              next six theory days.
