Abstract    :
              Site-directed mutagenesis will be used to substitute amino acid                
              residues in these enzymes,  and steady-state and transient                     
              kinetics, x-ray crystallography, and other methods will be used to             
              study these variants.  Amino acid residues in the proton relay                 
              system, and the environment of the catalytic zinc, will be studied.            
              Protein flexibility and hydrogen tunneling will be studied in the              
              liver enzyme.  "Extraneous" structural elements, including the                 
              structural zinc loop and other  loops, will be deleted.  The                   
              origins of the oligomeric structures will be explored.                         
              Fluorescence properties of the horse liver enzyme will be                      
              determined by x-ray crystallography.

              Alcohol dehydrogenases from horse liver and yeast have been studied            
              extensively.  The objectives of the proposed research are to answer            
              several outstanding questions about the catalytic mechanism of the             
              enzyme, the evolution of specificity for substrates and coenzymes,             
              and the role of the three dimensional structure in enzyme dynamics             
              and catalysis.  This research should increase our understanding of             
              biocatalysis.
