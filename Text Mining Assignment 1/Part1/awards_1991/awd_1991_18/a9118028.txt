Abstract    :
                   This award provides 50% funding required for the acquisition              
              of a direct-coupled plasma spectrometer to be installed and                    
              operated in the Department of Geology at the University of North               
              Carolina, Chapel Hill. The University of North Carolina is                     
              committed to providing the remaining funds necessary.                          
                   The instrument will be used primarily in the analysis of                  
              geological samples such as igneous rocks, sedimentary rocks,                   
              sediments, and pore waters. The Principal Investigator, on-campus              
              colleagues, and colleagues from Duke University and North Carolina             
              State University are expected to be the most frequent users. Many              
              of these investigators are actively involved in research projects              
              supported by the National Science Foundation for studies in igneous            
              petrogenesis, continental evolution, sedimentology, chemical                   
              alteration of sediments, paleoceanography, and environmental                   
              geology.
