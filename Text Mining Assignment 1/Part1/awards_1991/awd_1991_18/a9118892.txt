Abstract    :
                   The research planned for this 1 year grant seeks to answer                
              three questions using the pitcher-plant mosquito, Wyeomyia                     
              smithii.  1) How does the average growth rate (size at adulthood               
              + days to reach adulthood) of individuals in a population predict              
              fitness (rc= capacity for increase)?  2) Are growth rate and its               
              underpinnings of size at the time to adulthood heritable traits;               
              are these traits independent or interdependent (genetically                    
              correlated)?  3) Can variation in fitness between nearby and                   
              distant populations be explained by genes acting independently                 
              (additively) or is interaction within genes (dominance) and/or                 
              between genes (epistasis) an important component of genetic                    
              differentiation of populations?                                                
                   The ability of mosquito populations to transmit disease                   
              (their vectorial capacity) depends upon their adult size and                   
              longevity, traits which should be predictable from growth rate                 
              and its components.  Answers to the first two questions will then              
              have application for mosquito control.                                         
                   If, as they suspect, gene interactions are important in                   
              population differentiation, isolated populations may be harboring              
              greater genetic variation than is presently appreciated.  Answers              
              to the third question will then bear on the recovery of rare or                
              endangered species that persist only as fragmented populations.
