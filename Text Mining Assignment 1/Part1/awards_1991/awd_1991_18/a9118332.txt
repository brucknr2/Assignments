Abstract    :
                This research is to use existing high-resolution seismic                     
              reflection profiles and earthquake data with bathymetry and                    
              gravity measurements to study a region offshore southern                       
              California.  In this active seismic area, the objective will be                
              to delineate structures that are currently deforming and                       
              correlate them with locations of earthquakes.  This area includes              
              the site of the offshore 1986 M=5.8 Oceanside earthquake.  The                 
              results will help to determine if the identification of active                 
              deformation structures can be used to estimate seismic hazard.                 
              This research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard                 
              Reduction Program.
