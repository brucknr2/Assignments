Abstract    :
              The principal investigator will study rocks from the Proterozoic               
              crust of the midcontinent region of the USA, utilizing age-dating              
              and other geochemical techniques.  The main aim of the present work            
              is to better understand the extent of older basement beneath                   
              granite-rhyolite provinces, as well as the genesis of the granite-             
              rhyolite magmas.  This work is important in helping us understand              
              the geologic evolution of North America.
