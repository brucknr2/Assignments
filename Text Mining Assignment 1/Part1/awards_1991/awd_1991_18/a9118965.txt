Abstract    :
              In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry program                 
              of the Chemistry Division, Professors Bevan and Lucchese of                    
              Texas A&M University will use pulsed lasers to characterize                    
              hydrogen bond dynamics of gas phase systems. By making use of                  
              modern high resolution spectroscopic techniques applied to                     
              relatively simple diatomic and triatomic systems, it will be                   
              possible to test quantitative models for fundamental hydrogen                  
              bond properties at a level of detail not suitable for more                     
              complex situations.                                                            
              %%%                                                                            
              Hydrogen bonding is one of the most significant interactions                   
              between molecules. This kind of interaction influences such                    
              diverse properties as the boiling and freezing points of water                 
              and the structure of genetic material (DNA). The time course of                
              rapid hydrogen bond formation can best be investigated in                      
              simple gas phase systems which are amenable to detailed                        
              theoretical calculations. Professors Bevan and Lucchese will                   
              conduct experiments and develop appropriate theory for such                    
              systems, and the result will be a deeper understanding of the                  
              ubiquitous hydrogen bonding process.
