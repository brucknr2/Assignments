Abstract    :
                   The overall goal of this project is to determine the                      
              predictability of large-scale atmospheric patterns on timescales               
              of one to two weeks and rapidly developing midlatitude storms on               
              timescales of one to two days.  Sources of error in predicting                 
              these phenomena using numerical models can come from the model                 
              itself or from errors in the initial data used at the start of                 
              the prediction.  This research will attempt to distinguish                     
              between the two, examining cases of rapidly developing storms                  
              (explosive cyclogenesis) and persistent periods of high                        
              amplitude atmospheric wave patterns known as atmospheric blocks.               
              The work represents a continuation of research begun under a                   
              previous grant.  The principal investigator will employ a more                 
              sophisticated and more complete version of a general circulation               
              model than he used previously.                                                 
                This research ultimately should contribute to a better                       
              understanding of atmospheric dynamics and to improving short and               
              medium range weather prediction.
