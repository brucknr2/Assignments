Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Knotted (Kn1) locus, defined by dominant mutations that affect             
              leaf development, was cloned by transposon tagging.  Subsequent                
              sequence analysis demonstrated that Kn1 encodes a homeodomain, a               
              DNA-binding motif encoded by a number of Drosophila developmental              
              genes.  While the dominant, gain-of-function mutations specifically            
              affect the leaf, initial results demonstrate that in normal plants,            
              the protein is abundant in meristems and not detectable in                     
              developing leaves.  The present goal is to understand the wildtype             
              function of the Kn1  gene using both genetic and molecular                     
              approaches.  Loss of function mutations will be isolated in maize              
              and the gene will be ectopically expressed in transgenic plants to             
              evaluate the phenotype and functional domains of the gene.                     
              Unlinked suppressors will be isolated in Arabidopsis using either              
              the maize gene or a putative Arabidopsis Kn1 homolog.  Sequences               
              bound by the Kn1 protein in vivo will be immunoprecipitated using              
              a monoclonal antibody to determine what genes might be regulated               
              by Kn1.  Kn1 has many features expected of a key regulatory gene               
              including the homeobox, meristematic expression, and provocative               
              mutant phenotypes.  Understanding how Kn1 functions may provide                
              fundamental insight into the genetic control of plant development.
