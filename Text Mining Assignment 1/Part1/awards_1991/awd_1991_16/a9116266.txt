Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project involves the systematic collection and analysis of                
              rock samples form near-ridge seamounts on the pacific plate within             
              150 KM of the East Pacific Rise axis between 16 and 19 S.  Rock,               
              natural glass, and constituent minerals will be analyzed using                 
              electron probe, wavelength-dispersive X-ray fluorescence, and mass             
              spectrometer techniques.  These data, in conjunction with existing             
              geochemical data on the nearby East Pacific Rise axis, will form               
              the basis of a 3-D analysis of the upwelling zone associated with              
              this fast-spreading extreme of ocean ridge accretion.
