Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a field project to collect rocks from the Chile Ridge in               
              order to study the effects on magmatism when a spreading ridge is              
              being subducted.  The authors will test two hypotheses: (1) that               
              the subducting slab acts as a cap on upwelling of the mantle and               
              affects the foucsing of the magma to the ridge axis; (2) the break-            
              up of the slab can provide exchange between ocean mantle and mantle            
              under the arc.  The authors will study the elemental and isotopic              
              composition of rocks at varying distances from the trench.
