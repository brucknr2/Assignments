Abstract    :
              This award will provide logistical support for a period of five                
              years to the NOAA Aeronomy Laboratory to make measurements from                
              McMurdo and Palmer Stations in Antarctica, and to provide some                 
              logistical help in Thule, Greenland.  Ground-based visible and                 
              ultraviolet spectroscopy will be used to measure stratospheric                 
              column abundances of ozone (O3), nitrogen di (and tri) oxide (NO2              
              and NO3), chlorine dioxide (OClO) and bromine monoxide (BrO).  The             
              simultaneous measurements of these gases, and their seasonal and               
              diurnal variations, are of particular value in studying the polar              
              ozone holes and the photochemistry which is responsible for the                
              destruction of ozone.                                                          
                                                                                             
              This project is important for the study of manmade effects on                  
              global change.
