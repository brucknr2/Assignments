Abstract    :
                   Development of theoretical models for electron and                        
              positron collisions with atoms will be developed.  Both                        
              perturbative and non-perturbative techniques will be used.                     
              Perturbative calculations, exact to second order will be made                  
              for electron and positron scattering from helium, sodium and                   
              the heavier rare gases.  Optical potential model calculations                  
              will be made using a close coupling approach for the same                      
              atoms.
