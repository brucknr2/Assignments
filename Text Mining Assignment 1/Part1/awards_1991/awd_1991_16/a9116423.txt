Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will support the participation by nine U.S. scientists in           
              a U.S.-Japan Seminar on Electronic Structure and Fermiology of                 
              High-Tc Superconductors to be held July 27-29, 1992 in Sendai,                 
              Japan.  The co-organizers are Professor Arun Bansil, Physics                   
              Department, Northeastern University, Boston, and Professor                     
              Takashi Takahashi, Department of Physics, Tohoku University,                   
              Sendai, Japan.  The purpose of the seminar is to bring together                
              U.S. and Japanese scientists to discuss the nature of electronic               
              states in the high-temperature superconductors at and near the                 
              Fermi energy.  There is considerable activity in both countries in             
              this rapidly developing area of research and this seminar will                 
              provide an opportunity for reviewing the status of the field and               
              identifying new directions of research.                                        
                                                                                             
              The seminar will bring together theorists and experimentalists on              
              both the U.S. and Japanese sides.  The technical sessions will focus           
              on dHvA experiments, photoemission, positron annihilation, optical             
              studies, tunneling and NMR, and Raman and other studies.
