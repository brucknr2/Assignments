Abstract    :
              Novae explosions result from the sudden "burning" of fresh                     
              hydrogen dumped onto a white dwarf by an orbiting companion.                   
              The composition of the nova ejecta is dominated by heavy                       
              elements, reflecting the mass lost by the evolved white                        
              dwarf star.  One area in which nova observations has been                      
              lacking has been that of the infrared.  The Principal                          
              Investigator (PI) will conduct a three year study of bright                    
              nova with a modern detector in the infrared using the Uni-                     
              versity of Wyoming's 2.3-meter infrared telescope. These                       
              spectra will permit the study of fine-structure "coronal"                      
              lines as the nova ejecta gas becomes rarefied and as                           
              atoms of several intermediate-mass elements (Al, Ne, Si,                       
              Mg) selectively condense onto dust grains.  The PI's                           
              observations should provide direct evidence of this process                    
              and provide an understanding of the chemical abundances of                     
              this one important constituent of the dust grains in interstellar              
              space.
