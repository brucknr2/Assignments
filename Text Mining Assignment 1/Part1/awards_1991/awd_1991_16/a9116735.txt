Abstract    :
              This project is a Minority Research Initiation Planning Grant to               
              support an African American anthropologist to consult with                     
              leading experts in the anthropology of emotions, in order to help              
              her do a pilot research project on the African American women's                
              cultural construction of dysphoria, or depression.  The project                
              involves interviewing groups of women on their understanding of                
              dysphoria and their techniques for coping with it.  The planning               
              grant is designed to aid the applicant in preparing a full-                    
              fledged research proposal on this subject.  This sort of project               
              is important substantively, to further understanding on sub-                   
              cultural variation in how people conceptualize moods and                       
              emotions, and as a technique to increase the representation of                 
              minority scientists in the US.
