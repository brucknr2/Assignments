Abstract    :
              The major thrust of the Drexel University program focusses on the              
              recruitment and retention of the target groups which are currently             
              underrepresented in the graduate engineering fields.  A multi-                 
              pronged approach is utilized to inform and attract the target                  
              groups into the PhD program through media advertising in                       
              appropriate journals, presentations at engineering education                   
              conferences, and through personal contacts with faculty and                    
              professional staff in engineering education across the U.S.  To                
              assure the continued success of the program, contacts will also be             
              established and maintained with the undergraduate engineering                  
              programs and regional high schools through existing outreach                   
              programs at Drexel.  There is a mentor system to create an                     
              educational, social and emotional environment conducive to                     
              fostering successful acclimation and advancement of the recruited              
              students.  The object is to oversee and assist the progress of the             
              students from enrollment to employment.  An optional Industrial                
              Internship Program will be developed to encourage industrial                   
              participation, and to increase the financial resources available               
              to the students.  The NSF funds are viewed as seed money, namely               
              for establishing the program and for leveraging external funds                 
              through industrial, private, state and University sources to                   
              sustain the program on a regular basis.
