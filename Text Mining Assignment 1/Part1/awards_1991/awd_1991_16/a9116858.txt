Abstract    :
                We propose to model the temporal evolution of the large-scale                
              density structures of the plasmasphere as they are created and                 
              controlled by the dynamics of refilling and convection.  These                 
              structures are a prominent features appearing in measurements of               
              the plasmasphere and will be theoretically examined with a two-                
              dimensional plasmaspheric model ?Rasmussen et al., 1990! patterned             
              after Chen and Wolf ?1972!.  Our approach will be to parametrically            
              study plasmaspheric features created by a variety of temporally-               
              and spatially-varying electric fields and to compare these features            
              with recent measurements of the plasmasphere.  Areas of specific               
              interest are the two-dimensional structure of regions of relatively            
              dense plasma, which appear to be detached from the main body of the            
              plasmasphere when seen from the perspective of an orbiting                     
              satellite, as well as the creation of various characteristic                   
              plasmaspheric density profiles ?see Horwitz et al., 1990!.  This               
              modeling study is, in part, motivated by new observations of                   
              structures in the plasmasphere ?e.g., Carpenter et al., 1990;                  
              Horwitz et al., 1990; Anderson et al., 1990!.
