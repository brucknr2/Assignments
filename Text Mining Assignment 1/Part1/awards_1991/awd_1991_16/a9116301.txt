Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  One of the most urgent questions in biological                            
              oceanography at present is that of the fate of small                           
              phototrophs in pelagic food webs.  The prevailing concept,                     
              based on both theoretical considerations as well as laboratory                 
              and field data, is that phagotrophic protists are the dominant                 
              predators of < 5 um sized cells, and as well may consume a                     
              significant portion of the biomass production of larger                        
              phytoplankton.  Most previous studies of protistan herbivory                   
              have involved either laboratory experiments with single                        
              species, primarily ciliates, or estimation of total                            
              microzooplankton grazing pressure on natural phytoplankton                     
              assemblages. A more complete picture of the magnitude and                      
              details of the component parts of this link in pelagic food                    
              webs in needed, especially with respect to the role of                         
              phagotrophic flagellates.  Dr. Sherr and collaborators will                    
              investigate herbivory by pelagic flagellates and ciliates in                   
              the natural planktonic assemblages of Oregon coastal waters.                   
              Questions addressed will include: 1) Do phagotrophic protists                  
              have a greater grazing impact on <5 um sized phytoplankton than                
              on cells > 5 um? 2) What is the relative grazing impact of                     
              flagellates versus ciliates on phytoplankton? 3) Do rates of                   
              protistan herbivory show consistent day/night differences? 4)                  
              Do thresholds of prey density exist? 5) Does predation affect                  
              the cell division rates of phytoplankton? 6) Do phagotrophic                   
              protists show selective feeding among various phytoplankton                    
              taxa in situ?
