Abstract    :
              On behalf of a consortium of universities, the College of                      
              Oceanography at Oregon State University will undertake                         
              development and construction of piston and gravity coring                      
              capabilities for the new R/V THOMAS THOMPSON that is operated                  
              by the University of Washington.  The basic deck lay-out of                    
              this new ship that will commence research operations in late                   
              1991, was intended to accommodate a long-core handling                         
              system.  A deep ocean, long-core handling system will be                       
              designed and built based on systems successfully used on                       
              other U.S. and German research vessels.  The corer will be                     
              able to routinely retrieve large diameter (11.5 cm) 30 meter                   
              long cores.  This capability is important for ongoing and                      
              planned global ocean and other research projects.
