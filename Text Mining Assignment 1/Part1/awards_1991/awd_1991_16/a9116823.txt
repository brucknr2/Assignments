Abstract    :
              The School of Engineering at Howard University in conjunction with             
              the Materials Science Research Center of Excellence, and the                   
              Department of Electrical Engineering and Mechanical Engineering is             
              establishing an "Engineering Doctoral Enhancement Effort (EDEE)"               
              program.  The purpose of the program is to recruit and educate                 
              underrepresented graduate students with the terminal degree in                 
              engineering.  The program will support seven additional graduate               
              students pursuing the doctoral degree in engineering.  To qualify              
              for the fellowship support the candidates must be U.S. citizens or             
              permanent residents, and desire to pursue a career in teaching and             
              research, as exhibited by their past educational and professional              
              experiences.
