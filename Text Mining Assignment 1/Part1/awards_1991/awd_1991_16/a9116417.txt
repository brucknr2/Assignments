Abstract    :
              This award is made as the starter grant increment of Dr. Robert                
              Kennedy's Postdoctoral Fellowship in Chemistry Award in support                
              of his research at The University of Florida. The research                     
              will be an investigation of the electrochemistry of                            
              alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone, a tetradecapeptide, with                 
              the goal of developing a sensor which can be used to measure                   
              its release from individual cells of the rat pituitary gland.                  
              Fast scan cyclic voltammetry at carbon fiber microdisk                         
              electrodes will yield signals with suitable detection limits                   
              and stability.  The close spacing of the cell and the electrode                
              will prevent dilution of secreted hormone and allow for the                    
              observation of the release profile with minimum diffusional                    
              distortion. Liquid chromatography will be implemented to ensure                
              the identity of the voltammetric signal.

              The successful development of this micro-electro-analytical                    
              technique will provide a general method to study peptide                       
              secretion from individual cells with the best time resolution
