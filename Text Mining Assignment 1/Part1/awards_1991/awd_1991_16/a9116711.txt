              The primary objective of this U.S.-Bulgaria research                           
              project between Drs.William H. Outlaw, Peter H. Homann                         
              of Florida State University (FSU), Dr. Clanton C. Black                        
              of the University of Georgia, Dr. Andrew Maretzki of the                       
              Hawaiian Sugar Planter's Association (HSPA), and Drs.                          
              Mitko Nikolov Angelov, Emanuil N. Karanov, Antoaneta B.                        
              M. Kroumova, and Liliana Todorova Maslenkova of the

              Physiology (Sofia), is to conduct biophysical,                                 
              biochemical, and molecular biological investigations on                        
              plant physiological processes that affect plant                                
              productivity.  Specifically, the researchers will study                        
              photosynthesis allocation and water stress, basic                              
              disciplines which are relevant to agronomic                                    
              productivity.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              This project in plant physiology fulfills the program                          
              objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling                        
              leading experts in the United States and Eastern Europe                        
              to combine complementary talents and pool resources in                         
              areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
