Abstract    :
              The Southern Ocean is recognized as a critical region with regard              
              to its oceanic productivity and global carbon dioxide balance.  The            
              region is known to be elevated in nutrients year-round, but extreme            
              temporal and spatial variability on all scales is observed in the              
              productivity.  This project will focus on nitrogen dynamics, with              
              an emphasis on new production, that photosynthetic production or               
              organic material based on nitrate as a nitrogen source.                        
              Environmental factors controlling new production appear to be                  
              different in the Antarctic compared to temperate seas.                         
              Experiments aim to determine the relationship between new                      
              production and various factors such as irradiance, heterotrophic               
              use of reduced nitrogen compounds, and concentrations of urea and              
              ammonia. The research will be conducted on two international,                  
              multidisciplinary cruises on British and French ships. The                     
              collaboration with international scientists provides an excellent              
              opportunity to advance this field.
