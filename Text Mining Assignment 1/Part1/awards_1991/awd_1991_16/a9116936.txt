Abstract    :
                   ADMI stands for the Association of Department Heads of                    
              Computer Science and Engineering Departments at Minority                       
              Institutions and it was initially organized in 1989 at an                      
              NSF-funded workshop.  Its fundamental purpose is to increase                   
              the number of minorities in computer science and computer                      
              engineering through a variety of activities including the                      
              development of research and education programs.  With NSF                      
              support over the past two years ADMI has been able to conduct                  
              four proposal writing workshops for minority institutions, to                  
              initiate a visiting scientists program, to incorporate as a                    
              not-for-profit corporation, to conduct a membership drive,                     
              and to begin to develop an industrial affiliates program.                      
              ADMI currently represents about 75 of the 117 minority                         
              institutions which have departments or programs in computer                    
              science or computer engineering.  The purpose of the grant is                  
              to provide enough additional startup support to ADMI for one                   
              year to allow it to become self-sufficient.  ADMI will                         
              organize and run a conference on resource issues for                           
              minority institutions, develop research and educational                        
              programs for its member institution (including mentoring                       
              programs), develop fund raising mechanisms, and prepare a                      
              proposal for the Alliances for Minority Participation                          
              program.
