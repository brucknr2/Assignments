Abstract    :
                   In spring 1989, a new and unique fossil deposit was uncovered             
              in the Pinecrest Beds at the Richardson Road Shell Pit, Sarasota               
              County, Florida.  This deposit is composed primarily of complete               
              bones and articulated skeletons of one species of cormorant                    
              (Phalacrocoracidae) as well as hundreds of bones and otoliths of               
              marine fish.  Such a complete sample of one species of bird is                 
              rare, and only one other locality in North America (Bone Valley,               
              Florida, 4.5 Ma; see Becker 1985) has produced a large sample of               
              complete (but no associated) bones of cormorant.  Funds from the               
              NSF SGER grants program will allow excavation of this unique fossil            
              site before it is lost to erosion, looting and mining operations.              
              Because this site is in imminent danger of total destruction, a                
              grant from the SGER program will allow immediate action to ensure              
              that the deposits are properly excavated and studied.  these                   
              excavations will result in the recovery of substantial fossil                  
              material and provide taphonomic information on how this assemblage             
              formed.
