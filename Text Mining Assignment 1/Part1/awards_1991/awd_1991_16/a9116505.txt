Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Fundamental research directed toward improved understanding at the             
              atomic level of interatomic bonding, electronic states of                      
              surfaces/interfaces, and epitaxial crystal growth will be                      
              conducted.  The PI is a recognized expert in surface science, and              
              is employing a unique combination of surface science analytical                
              techniques, time-of-flight impact-collision ion-scattering                     
              spectrometry(TOF ICISS), ballistic electron emission                           
              microscopy(BEEM), and scanning tunneling microscopy(STM) to study              
              the properties and behavior of metals(indium, tin, and lead)                   
              deposited on silicon.  This material combination was chosen for the            
              study because little or no metal diffuses into the substrate, the              
              interface is sharp, and the surface reconstructions which occur as             
              a consequence of metal deposition on the surface are well-ordered              
              with small defect concentrations.                                              
              %%%                                                                            
              This research is expected to provide deeper fundamental                        
              understanding of atomic interactions and their relationship to                 
              epitaxial crystal growth.  From an application point of view,                  
              understanding these properties is helpful to semiconductor device              
              design and fabrication.  The results will be of importance in a                
              general way to the technology of large scale, high speed integrated            
              electronic circuits.
