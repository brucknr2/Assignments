Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Rapid advances in remote sensing technology have made possible            
              nearly continous monitoring of the atmosphere in fine spatial de-              
              tail. Several new observing systems, including wind profilers,                 
              NEXRAD doppler radars, automated surface observing stations,                   
              computer-assisted aircraft observing systems, and improved                     
              satellite instrumentation have either been recently deployed, or               
              will be deployed in the U.S. in the 1990's. At the same time                   
              computer facilities with order-of magnitude increases in                       
              computational capability have become available to the National                 
              Weather Service (NWS). These advances offer opportunites for                   
              significant improvements in numerical weather prediction (NWP),                
              exemplified by development of a 30-km resolution mesoscale model               
              (the . model) at the National Meteorological Center (NMC),                     
              scheduled for operational use in about 1992. A critical element in             
              the advancement of NWP is the more accurate specification of the               
              initial state, using the full capability of the advanced systems to            
              be deployed. The work proposed combines two mathematical approaches            
              ("nudging" and the adjoint equation method) in the development of              
              a 4-dimensional (spatial and time) data assimilation (4DDA) scheme.            
              It carries through to the testing and evaluation of such a scheme              
              at PSU. The NMC has already expressed interest, contigent upon the             
              PSU research results, in transferring the scheme and testing it in             
              an operational environment.
