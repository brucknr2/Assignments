Abstract    :
              In this project, the PI will collect and analyze upper ocean                   
              velocity data using an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP)                
              during cruise P14-C from Aukland, NZ to Suva, Fiji, as part of the             
              World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE).  Hydrographic and                   
              tracer work have already been funded for this section, and the                 
              addition of velocity data will allow more thorough interpretation              
              of the entire data set.
