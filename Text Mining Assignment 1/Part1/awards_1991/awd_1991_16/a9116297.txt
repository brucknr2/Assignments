Abstract    :
                   This is the first of a three year continuing award.  There                
              search focuses on planning of multifingered robotic grasping of                
              objects in situations where there is incomplete information. The               
              grasping behavior will be continuously and incremetally refined                
              based on sensed information during task execution and                          
              reasoningabout object and manipulator geometry.  The grasping                  
              operation will combine reflexive behavior based on simple                      
              stimulus-action rules and local information only, with reactive                
              behavior which provides robust capabilities for dealing with                   
              uncertainties and minimizes the amount of preplanning                          
              resourcefully without a priori models of the environment or the                
              task.  Such systems will be needed for autonomous robotic                      
              operation in unstructured, unfamiliar, or unpredictably changing               
              situations such as space, underwater, or environmental                         
              operations, and may also be easier and more economical to deploy               
              in more structured environments such as some manufacturing                     
              processes.
