Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will support a two-year U.S.-Japan cooperative                      
              research project between Professor Richard Schlichting,                        
              Department of Computer Science, University of Arizona, and                     
              Professor Takuya Katayama, Department of Computer Science,                     
              Tokyo Institute of Technology.  The goal of the project is to                  
              simplify the construction of fault-tolerant software, that is, software        
              that can continue to provide service despite failures in the                   
              underlying computing platform.  The specific intent is to adapt the            
              AG programming languages developed at the Tokyo Institute of                   
              Technology for this purpose by extending it to support two                     
              techniques frequently used in fault-tolerant programming, recovery             
              and replication.  AG is based on attribute grammars, and as such,              
              offers advantages such as a declarative style, separation of semantic          
              and syntactic definitions, and a functional foundation.
