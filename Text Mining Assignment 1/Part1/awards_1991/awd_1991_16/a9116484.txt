Abstract    :
              This award will support the participation of ten U.S. scientists               
              in a U.S.-Japan Seminar on Two-Phase Flow Dynamics, to be held                 
              July 5-11, 1992 in Berkeley, California.  The co-organizers are                
              Professor Virgil Schrock, Department of Nuclear Engineering,                   
              University of California Berkeley, and Professor Tadashi                       
              Sakaguchi, Department of Production Engineering, Kobe University,              
              Japan.                                                                         
                                                                                             
              Two-phase flow dynamics is a short name for the complex                        
              problems that involve the transient and steady state motions of                
              fluids comprised of more than one phase.  Such flows are                       
              especially challenging to analyze because the interface                        
              separating the phases is usually moving and changing in a very                 
              complex way that depends upon mechanical, thermodynamic, and                   
              sometimes chemical effects.  This seminar will deal with selected              
              topics in two-phase flow dynamics that are fundamental problems                
              in their own right and are central to  analysis of large complex               
              energy systems, especially the transient behavior of such systems              
              and their esponses in hypothetical accident scenarios.  The                    
              research now underway by the U.S. and Japanese seminar                         
              participants has begun to identify new approaches that hold the                
              promise of substantial improvement in the predictive capability                
              of two-phase flow analysis.  The participants will discuss the                 
              current state of knowledge in this field and the difficult                     
              unresolved problems, and they will attempt to develop a vision of              
              how the subject can be advanced and what directions for future                 
              research will be most promising.
