Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                  This is a three-year project to study included fluids, fluid-             
              rock interactions, and fluid-transport processes associated with               
              rocks of the Continental Deep-Drilling Program (KTB) in the                    
              Bavarian Oberpfalz region.  The three specific aspects of the                  
              drilling project to be addressed are:  1) Characterization of                  
              volatile-bearing fluid inclusions (by quantitative laser Raman                 
              microspectroscopy and conventional microthermometry); 2) structural            
              characterization and petrologic interpretation of graphite (by                 
              laser Raman microspectroscopy and petrographic analysis); and 3)               
              investigation of the chemical evolution of the C-0-H-N fluids,                 
              which in come cases culminated in graphite precipitation.  The                 
              principal investigator's research group is particularly suited to              
              this project because of many previous and ongoing studies,                     
              including developing methodologies for:  the quantitative Raman                
              analysis of fluid inclusions in the C-O-H-N system; quantifying                
              internal volatile pressures from Raman peak parameters in multi-               
              component C-O-H-N gas/fluid mixtures; and characterizing graphite              
              structures and their associated metamorphic grades from Raman                  
              spectral parameters.  In addition, evaluations of fluid evolution              
              will be aided by ongoing studies of stable and metastable                      
              equilibria in synthetic fluids in the C-O-H system, and by studies             
              of fluid-rock interactions in parts of the Duluth mafic intrusive              
              complex wherein both fluids and lithologies bear strong                        
              compositional similarities to those of the KTB.
