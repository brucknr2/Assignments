Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will support a two-year U.S.-Japan cooperative                      
              research project between Professor Yuki-Kazu Iwasa, Department                 
              of Mechanical Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology,              
              and Professor Kaoru Yamafuji, Department of Electronics, Kyushu                
              University, Fukuoka, Japan.  Other U.S. investigators involved in              
              the project are from the University of Wisconsin, Oak Ridge                    
              National Laboratory, the National Institute for Standards and                  
              Technology, and Brookhaven National Laboratory.  Other Japanese                
              investigators are from Osaka University, Yokohama National                     
              University, Iwate University, and Nihon University.                            
                                                                                             
              The project will focus on three important areas of research on                 
              superconducting magnet technology:  (1) engineering issues on                  
              high-Tc superconductor magnet technology, emphasizing and                      
              incorporating the requirements of fabricability, windability,                  
              stability, protection, and operating temperature; (2) thermal                  
              stability and protection for high-Tc magnet systems; and (3) AC                
              losses in high-Tc superconductors.  The U.S. and Japanese                      
              research groups will share their unique facilities to collaborate in           
              both experimental and analytical studies in these important areas.
