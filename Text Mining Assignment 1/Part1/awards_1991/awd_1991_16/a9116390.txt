Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              How did the universe, which apparently began with an almost                    
              perfectly uniformly expanding Big Bang, evolve into the present                
              exceedingly complex and granular structure of galaxies, clusters               
              and superclusters of galaxies, and vast voids?  Theories to account            
              for this are best tested by observations of the changing clustering            
              of objects over exceedingly great distances and look back times                
              toward the beginning.  Only quasars are bright enough to permit                
              this, but they are too few in number to define the early structure.            
              Far more numerous absorbing objects exist between us and the                   
              distant quasars.  Using an existing multifiber spectrograph (to be             
              in the second year of the grant) and the McDonald Observatory 2.7 -            
              meter reflector to detect and analyze the redshifts of these                   
              absorbing clouds along lines of sight to the quasars, the                      
              clustering of large numbers of otherwise undectable high redshift              
              objects can be described, thereby directly studying the evolution              
              of large-scale structure in the universe.  The effects of ionizing             
              flux from quasars upon their local neutral hydrogen environment                
              will also be measured, and the incidence will be determined.                   
                                                                                             
              This is the second part of a two part collaborative project.  Dr.              
              Smith has worked for many years in extragalactic studies.  Dr.                 
              Crotts, the co-investigator, is a leading young instrumentalist.
