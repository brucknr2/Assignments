Abstract    :
                   The multilinear extension (MLE) of a game, first introduced               
              as a technique for calculating the value of a game, has over the               
              past two decades been shown to have numerous other applications.               
              In this project its mathematical properties will be studied in                 
              some detail, with a view towards such applications as the                      
              computation of both symmetric and asymmetric values of large                   
              games, deriving other (asymmetric) values to games, developing                 
              solution concepts for games without side payments, and computing               
              reduced games.                                                                 
                   MLE may also be used to resolve certain problems which are                
              found in the current representation of some types of games.                    
              These include non-atomic games, which are used to represent                    
              economic situations of pure competition, and spatial games, which              
              are frequently used to model voting and coalition formation in                 
              political situations.  In both of these cases, the current                     
              representation fails to allow for some stochastic behavior on the              
              part of agents; the MLE (which has a probabilistic                             
              interpretation) can remedy this drawback.
