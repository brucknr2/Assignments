Abstract    :
              The purpose of this award to the American Society of Civil                     
              Engineers (ASCE) is for ASCE to organize a technical study mission             
              to Germany, Austria, Hungary and Czechoslovakia.  ASCE has in                  
              effect Agreements of Cooperation with engineering societies in                 
              these countries (with the exception of the Czechoslovakian                     
              societies) and these agreements are instrumental in strengthening              
              the relationships between American civil engineers and those of the            
              countries where the Agreements exist.  This study mission will                 
              assist materially in cementing these relationships and energizing              
              future cooperative research efforts between U.S. engineers and                 
              those in these countries.  The mission to Hungary and                          
              Czechoslovakia is particularly significant in this regard as these             
              countries move from a centrally planned to a market-driven economy.
