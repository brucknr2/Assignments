Abstract    :
                This grant supports one-half of the inside-U.S. expenses for                 
              hosting, in September, U.S. university scientists and the 15-                  
              member State Seismological Bureau delegation for the 1991                      
              Coordinator's Meeting of the US/PRC Earthquake Studies Protocol                
              and for a Symposium on "Earthquake Prediction:  The State of the               
              Art".  The State Seismological Bureau, the U.S. Geological                     
              Survey, and the National Science Foundation are the members of                 
              the Protocol.  This travel and symposium is important to the                   
              successful conduct of U.S. projects of earthquake hazards                      
              research planned or underway in the PRC.  This research is a                   
              component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
