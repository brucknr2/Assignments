Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will support a two-year U.S.-Japan cooperative                      
              research project between Dr. David Furth, Department of                        
              Entomology, Museum of Comparative Zoology, Harvard                             
              University, and Professor Kunio Suzuki, Department of Biology,                 
              Toyama University, Japan.  The project involves joint study of the             
              insect specimens housed in Japan, focusing on the collections of               
              chrysomelids, including especially the so-called "flea beetles" of             
              subfamily Alticinae.  The investigators will undertake to upgrade              
              the basic taxonomy of the group by describing the reliable                     
              morphological characters for distinguishing species and genera.                
                                                                                             
              Dr. Furth and Professor Suzuki are experts on chrysomelid                      
              morphology and systematics, especially with the characters to be               
              used in this character congruence study.  Dr. Furth will spend                 
              three months travelling in Japan with Professor Suzuki to study the            
              Asian flea beetle genera available in collections in Japan.  This              
              study will demonstrate the usefulness of correlation of characters             
              (congruence) to phylogenetic research in systematic biology and                
              will eluicdate the Galerucinae/Alticinae relationship and provide              
              the foundation for creating a tribal system in the Alticinae.
