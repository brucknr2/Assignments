Abstract    :
              This award provides for the development of flow cytometric                     
              techniques and instrumentation for the analysis of large cell (10              
              to 50 microns in diameter), principally plant cell protoplasts.                
              The emphasis will be on development of digital pulse processing                
              modules for real time analysis and sorting.  The development of                
              novel substrates and gene expression systems for use with                      
              transgenic plants will also be explored.  Finally, these techniques            
              will be used to select populations of transgenic plant cells                   
              expressing developmentally regulated genes as a first step in the              
              construction of tissue specific-DNA libraries.
