Abstract    :
              This award will support a research collaboration                               
              between a group headed by Prof. John Sclater of the                            
              Scripps Institution of Oceanography and Prof. Ricardo                          
              Fernandez of the Centro de Investigacion Cientifica y                          
              Educacion Superior de Ensenada (CICESE) of Mexico.                             
              The purpose of the collaboration is to study the                               
              relation between heat flow and depth in the Gulf of                            
              Mexico.                                                                        
                                                                                             
              The old ocean floor of the western Gulf of Mexico has                          
              the lowest heat flow observed through oceanic crust.                           
              Most researchers have ignored these data, which was                            
              collected in the 60's, attributing the low values to                           
              unusually rapid sedimentation or to non-linear thermal                         
              gradients.  However, a re-analysis of much of the data                         
              suggests that the role of non-linear gradients has                             
              been exaggerated and that much of the data may be                              
              reliable.  For this project, the investigators intend                          
              to carry out detailed heat flow surveys around two                             
              sites in the Gulf of Mexico, make individual                                   
              measurements on a transect between the two sites,                              
              analyze these data, and determine whether it supports                          
              the thermal boundary layer model indicated by the                              
              earlier measurements.
