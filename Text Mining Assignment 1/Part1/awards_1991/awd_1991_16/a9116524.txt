Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This Doctoral Dissertation Improvement award is directed towards               
              understanding the immunological factors contributing to variation              
              in reproductive performance in non-human primate species.  Among               
              some human populations, immunological similarity between mates                 
              appears to increase the likelihood of pregnancy loss.  If true,                
              this would provide an evolutionary pressure selecting for                      
              increased genetic diversity within populations.                                
                                                                                             
              This study will investigate the relationship between reproductive              
              outcome and the major histocompatibility complex in a captive                  
              colony of Macaca nemestrina at the Washington Primate Research                 
              Center.  The degree of immunological similarity between                        
              successful and unsuccessful pairs will be compared.  Findings                  
              from this study will help to characterize the evolutionary forces              
              which are currently effecting the reproductive performance in all              
              primates.
