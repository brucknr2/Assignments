Abstract    :
              The objectives of this study are:  (1) to investigate                          
              experimentally how thiosulfate and polythionates form through                  
              sulfur-water interaction (T>100oC), (2) to determine experimentally            
              the thermal stabilities of thiosulfate and polythionates, (3) to               
              determine experimentally the catalytic effects of mineral surfaces             
              (pyrite and quartz) and trace levels of Fe2+(aq) on (1) and (2),               
              and (4) to determine the sulfur speciation in several sulfur-rich              
              hot springs in Yellowstone National Park in situ.  Objectives are              
              achieved through a combination of experimental work in the                     
              hydrothermal laboratory and field work in collaboration with the               
              U.S.G.S.  Ion Chromatographic techniques will be used for the in               
              situ analysis of sulfur species, the PI will again collaborate with            
              Kirk Nordstrom, and use a mobile, U.S.G.S. laboratory equipped with            
              an IC identical to the one in the PI's lab.  The results of these              
              experiments will be used to identify natural hydrothermal                      
              solutions that could contain sulfur oxyanions in significant                   
              concentrations.
