Abstract    :
              Our goal is to expand the capabilities of our lifetime-                        
              resolved multifrequency phase fluorometer in order to be                       
              able to resolve the conformational heterogeneity and                           
              dynamics of biomolecules (i.e., both lipids and proteins).                     
              We require i) a laser system capable of providing an                           
              intrinsically modulated coherent light source for excitation                   
              of a range of different chromophores and ii) a microchannel                    
              plate photomultiplier tube (MCP-PMT) for phase sensitive                       
              detection at the ultrahigh frequencies characteristic of                       
              subnanosecond lifetime comoponents.  This instrumentation                      
              will enable us to dramatically increase the sensitivity                        
              (i.e., ~ 1000 fold) and dynamic range of our instrument, and                   
              will provide the resolution necessary to accurately measure                    
              the time-dependent terms relating to the fluorescence                          
              intensity decay of site-directed fluorophores, allowing us                     
              to directly measure the conformational hetergeneity an                         
              dynamics of macromolecules.  In addition, the higher                           
              incident power will allow us to utilize small amounts of                       
              material (i.e., < 10 pmoles).  This latter capability will                     
              permit the initiation of experiments aimed at identifying                      
              key regulatory features in highly purified, native membranes                   
              (e.g., brain synaptic membranes) at low, nonperturbing                         
              concentrations of fluorophores; as well as structure-                          
              function relationships on site-directed mutants of the ATP                     
              Synthase (CF1CF0), Ca-ATPase, and the Glutamate Receptor.
