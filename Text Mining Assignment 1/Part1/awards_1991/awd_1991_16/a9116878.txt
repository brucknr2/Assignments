Abstract    :
              The Graduate Engineering Education program at Cornell University               
              will be associated with three nationally ranked, well equipped and             
              well staffed graduate fields: Electrical Engineering, Computer                 
              Science, and Materials Science and Engineering.  Their research                
              activities encompass a complete spectrum of studies from                       
              semiconductor and optical materials, to devices, to software and               
              hardware, and finally to system integration.  These activities                 
              propel the rapid developments of computers and communication                   
              systems.  Persons with doctorates in these fields will meet                    
              extremely urgent needs for engineering faculty and research                    
              positions.  This program will build on and further enhances the                
              ongoing efforts in identifying, attracting and training graduate               
              students from targeted groups.  The goals are:  development of                 
              candidates; timely support of application process for admission and            
              financial aids; provision of a rigorous, friendly, and supportive              
              education environment; guidance of career goals and placements.
