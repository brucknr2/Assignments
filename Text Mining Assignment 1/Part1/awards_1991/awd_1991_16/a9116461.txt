Abstract    :
                   This award provides support to the University Navstar                     
              Consortium (UNAVCO) located in Boulder, Colorado. UNAVCO is a                  
              consortium of 30 U.S. universities that manages a facility                     
              providing equipment and logistical assistance to earth scientists              
              making use of the Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites for               
              research in crustal dynamics, earthquake, volcano, and global                  
              change research.                                                               
                   Using GPS, vector baselines between receivers separated by 100            
              kilometers or more are now being routinely measured with one                   
              centimeter (or 100 parts per billion) accuracy. Such measurements              
              can be completed using portable equipment in a few hours or less.              
              The ability to make such measurements has found immediate                      
              applications in research on global plate tectonics, earthquake                 
              mechanics, volcano monitoring, and regional tectonics.                         
                   The UNAVCO facility offers a complete support program for                 
              university-based investigators including assistance in planning                
              filed work, training of personnel, equipment, shipping, customs,               
              field operations, technical troubleshooting, data management,                  
              analysis and archiving. UNAVCO also represents the academic                    
              research community and acts as a central clearinghouse for                     
              information on the scientific applications of GPS. As a part of its            
              service to investigators, UNAVCO tests GPS equipment and                       
              techniques, and works to improve GPS surveying accuracy.
