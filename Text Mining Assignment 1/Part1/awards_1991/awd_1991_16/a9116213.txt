Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Recent developments in long period seismology provide an                       
              opportunity to constrain the large scale framework of tectonics                
              through seismic velocity variation in the oceanic upper mantle.                
              Resolution has been improved to a level of about 100 km and                    
              important details of ridges and hotspots can be observed.  In order            
              to improve the seismic structure and discover further correlation              
              with tectonic features, the principal investigator will work on the            
              following:  (1) extension of surface wave data to obtain better                
              coverage in the southern hemisphere, (2) analysis of shorter period            
              surface waves to improve resolution within the lithosphere, (3)                
              waveform analysis of S, SS, SSS,... and P, PP, PPP,... type body               
              waves in order to increase depth resolution, and (4) joint analysis            
              of seismic, geoid, and topography data to examine consistency of               
              models.
