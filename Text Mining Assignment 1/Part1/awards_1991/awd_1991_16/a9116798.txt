Abstract    :
              The Protein Data Bank (PDB) contains the atomic structure of                   
              macromolecules. As of October 1991 there were 790 structural                   
              entries (196 Mbytes), if current growth rates persist, this                    
              number could grow to 10,000 by the end of the decade. The data                 
              provide opportunities for understanding biological function                    
              through, for example, comparative structural research.  This work              
              addresses several challenges in first making the PDB more                      
              accessible to molecular biologists and crystallographers in                    
              particular, and second assisting in the management of increasing               
              amounts of data. Several software developments are being                       
              undertaken in parallel, but share the same class libraries.                    
              First, a new object-based PDB storage format provides suitable                 
              access to the levels of substructure found in macromolecules.                  
              Second, object-based software tools that interrogate and                       
              manipulate structural data, and assist in structure verification               
              are being derived from existing structured programs. Finally, a                
              high-level query language provides intuitive and direct                        
              interaction with the PDB. Each aspect of software development                  
              proceeds by prototyping followed by iterative cycles of testing                
              in the laboratory and code modification. This work integrates the              
              state-of-art database research results such as object-oriented                 
              databases and knowledge bases, software engineering results such               
              as component and glue collaborative work such as extended                      
              transaction models to support cooperative scientific research.                 
              These tools could potentially precipitate the discovery of new                 
              structure-function relationships by permitting data query in a                 
              more intuitive fashion.
