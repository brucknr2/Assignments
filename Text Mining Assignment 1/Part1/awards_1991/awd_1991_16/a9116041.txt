Abstract    :
              Convergent margin accretionary prisms are structurally complex                 
              geological features.  This is a proposal to conduct a walkaway                 
              Vertical Seismic Profile experiment at Oregon Margin site OM-3 to              
              image the structural features within 3km of the borehole both                  
              perpendicular and parallel to structural strike.  This should                  
              result in better definition of the frontal thrust and its associ-              
              ated amplitude anomalies as well as part of the protothrust zone.              
                                                                                             
              Because the VSP's will be acquired in the drill hole using                     
              surface seismic sources, they should provide a better tie to                   
              surface seismic data.  The walkaway VSP illumunates the zone                   
              below the borehole geophone, thereby imaging the structure below               
              and laterally away from the drill hole.  This lateral coverage                 
              will yield amplitude vs offset information, which will be used                 
              for inferring fluid contents of the frontal thrust and other                   
              layers that exhibit anomalous amplitudes.                                      
                                                                                             
              This award will support Dr. Moore's efforts to obtain Vertical                 
              Seismic Profiles (VSP) at the Oregon Margin drill site 3 (OM-3),               
              which will be drilled on ODP Leg 146.  This experiment will                    
              provide a more comprehensive three dimensional picture of the                  
              complex structural features of an accretionary prism within a                  
              three kilometer radius of the borehole. This will lead to a                    
              better understanding of the coupled structural and hydrogeologic               
              system within the prism. VSP's will also allow direct comparison               
              of seismic information to cored material and borehole logging                  
              data.
