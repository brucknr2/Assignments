Abstract    :
                This grant is to provide partial support for the International               
              Seismological Centre in the U.K.  Data from this center has                    
              provided the cornerstone for many research efforts in the U.S.                 
              and is a necessary and useful asset of the global seismological                
              community.  This research is a component of the National                       
              Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
