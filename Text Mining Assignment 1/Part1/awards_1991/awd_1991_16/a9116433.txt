Abstract    :
              This award, co-funded by the Brazil Program and the                            
              Eukaryotic Genetics Program, supports cooperative                              
              research in biology to be conducted by Dr. Joyce L.                            
              Hamlin of the University of Virginia School of                                 
              Medicine and Dr. Francisco J.S. Lara of the University                         
              of Sao Paulo, Brazil.  The focus of the research is to                         
              gain an understanding of replication in complex                                
              eukaryotic genomes.                                                            
                                                                                             
              The project will study the control of replication of                           
              the DNA puff regions in the salivary glands of the                             
              sciarid fly, Rhynchosciara americana.  The system                              
              offers an unusual opportunity to examine special                               
              regulatory controls over replication that are                                  
              exercised during development.  The collaboration                               
              between the two laboratories is synergistic, thereby                           
              allowing studies that would be impossible to carry out                         
              in either of the individual groups.                                            
              The Hamlin group offers expertise in molecular biology                         
              while the Lara group is expert in all aspects of the                           
              biology of Rhynchosciara.
