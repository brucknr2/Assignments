Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is the sedimentary geology componenet of AMASEDS. The                     
              objective of AMASEDS was to identify dominant processes controlling            
              strata formation on different time and vertical scales and their               
              implication for paleoenvironmental interpretations. This is a new              
              award to allow the laboratory analysis of AMASEDS samples to be                
              continued towards the fruition of the project.
