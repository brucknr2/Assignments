Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              The large climate change oceanographic programs JGOFS (Global Ocean            
              Flux Study) and WOCE (World Ocean Circulation Experiment) now being            
              implemented require data management systems which will make                    
              possible the exchange and synthesis of diverse and widely spread               
              data sets.  Substantial progress on a data management system for               
              JGOFS (and potentially other programs such as WOCE and other global            
              change initiative) which:  can be easily used as a simple, but                 
              flexible, database on microcomputers and workstations; will have               
              common database features for combining and manipulating data sets,             
              and have non-common but scientifically useful features such as                 
              interpolating one data set against another; will be "extensible,"              
              meaning that new features or operations can be added at any time               
              without requiring the alteration of existing software or                       
              operations; can be easily used to import data from other PI's and              
              data archives, both national and international, over a network;                
              will impose minimal format restrictions on user's data; and will               
              give users of larger machines simple procedures for gathering data             
              from many sources over networks without regard to the originator's             
              or end user's data format.                                                     
                                                                                             
              In addition, a number of data sets which will be of interest in                
              JGOFS planning and synthesis work are being gathered, edited and               
              placed on-line.  This part of the effort, in addition to its                   
              scientific value, provides a number of diverse data sets for                   
              testing and demonstrating the capabilities of the system.  This                
              current renewal effort will complete the development and                       
              installation of this system.
