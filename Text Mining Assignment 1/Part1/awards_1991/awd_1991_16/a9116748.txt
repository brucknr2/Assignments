Abstract    :
              Theoretical research will be conducted on the properties of the                
              two-dimensional electron liquid in the presence of long-range                  
              disorder.  This type of disorder is usually created in                         
              heterostructures with large spacer width by randomly distributed               
              remote impurity ions.  Screening by the two-dimensional electron               
              liquid competes effectively with the resultant random potential.               
              However, in some cases this screening is not effective and the two-            
              dimensional electron liquid becomes very inhomogeneous.  In a                  
              strong magnetic field this state occurs each time the filling                  
              factor of the Landau level corresponds to an integer or a                      
              fractional gap.  Different manifestations of the inhomogeneous                 
              state will be studied: the low temperature behavior of the                     
              conductivity tensor in the filling factor range where all gaps are             
              destroyed by disorder; the width of the plateau of the quantum Hall            
              effect; the attenuation of the surface acoustic waves; the Wigner              
              crystal formation in the presence of the long range disorder.                  
              %%%                                                                            
              Theoretical studies will be made on the physics of mesoscopic                  
              systems where quantum effects are manifest on a macroscopic scale.             
              In particular, studies will be made on the effects of disorder on              
              the properties of the two-dimensional electron liquid which forms              
              at junctions between semiconductors.
