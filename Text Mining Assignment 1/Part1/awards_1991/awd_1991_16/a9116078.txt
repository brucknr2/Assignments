Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The study will initiate a series of experiments to investigate                 
              theeffects of supercritical phase separation on the distribution               
              ofelements and isotopes in subseafloor hydrothermal systems.                   
              Thiswill allow modelling of phase separation processes.  Gas and               
              trace element-spiked NaCl-dominated fluids will be used in                     
              analyses. Funding is provided for two years.
