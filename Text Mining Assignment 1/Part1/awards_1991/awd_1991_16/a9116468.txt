Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award supports the development of a computerized database                 
              and network of the microbial germplasm collections, "the                       
              Microbial Germplasm Database", that are utilized in research                   
              related to plant biology.  The Microbial Germplasm Database will               
              contain information concerning living culture collections of                   
              plant associated microbes and viruses, that are located all over               
              the world.  These collections are valuable resources for the                   
              research community, however, are not efficiently utilized because              
              they are not catalogued or quantified for easy access.  The                    
              Microbial Germplasm Database will provide the research community               
              with a centralized information center where all plant-associated               
              microbes collections will be described with an easy on-line                    
              access.  This database will be linked to other databases of                    
              similar nature, such as the World Data Center at Riken, Japan.
