Abstract    :
              This renewal project will continue the investigation of the Model              
              Elimination (ME) procedure.  The ME procedure, a linear input proof            
              procedure, has received recent attention for several reasons,                  
              including the ability to use the elegant Prolog implementation                 
              architectures.  Previous work has demonstrated by implementation that          
              ME has an advantage over other uniform provers on an interesting set           
              of hard problems.  New investigation will attempt to overcome the most         
              severe handicap of the ME procedure, no use of intermediate results,           
              without destroying the speed advantage ME enjoys.  For example, the            
              optional nature of lemma use for ME invites highly selective                   
              mechanisms for Lemma retention.  An alternate approach allows low              
              selectivity but not as much possibility of high gains.  Work will              
              also continue on the development of sequential, parallel and                   
              distributed implementations of ME.
