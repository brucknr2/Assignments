Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will support a two-year U.S.-Japan cooperative science              
              project between Professor Frederick Frey, Department of Earth,                 
              Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences, Massachusetts Institute of                
              Technology, and Professor Masaaki Obata, Department of                         
              Geology, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan.  This project                   
              is part of Professor Frey's current research to determine the trace            
              element and isotropic systematics of minerals and whole-rocks from             
              contiguous layers in the Horoman peridotite, Hokkaido, which                   
              grew out of a conference in July 1990 sponsored by the U.S.-Japan              
              Cooperative Science Program.  At that time, Professor Frey and                 
              his colleagues at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution                     
              obtained samples of the Horoman peridotite that they brought back              
              to study in their petrologic and geochemical analytical laboratories.          
              During Professor Frey's visit to Japan in 1992 he will discuss his             
              laboratory results and revisit and study important field locations.
