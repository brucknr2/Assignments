Abstract    :
                   This project supports a workshop by the National Academy of               
              Sciences to develop a research briefing and a paper on the role of             
              the mathematical sciences in high performance computing and                    
              computation.  The briefing paper will be used in planning at the               
              National Science Foundation and will be distributed to other                   
              federal agencies that support research in the mathematical sciences            
              and high performance computing.                                                
                   The project has particular promise for identifying research               
              opportunities and research topics in the mathematical sciences that            
              require emphasis in order that the High Performance Computing and              
              Communications program outlined by the Federal Coordinating Council            
              for Science, Engineering, and Technology reach its full potential.
