Abstract    :
                   Management of pest species in agricultural environments has               
              become highly technical since the introduction of synthetic                    
              chemicals as pesticides.  The judicious use of these chemical                  
              tools, integrated with cultural, mechanical and biological controls            
              to minimize effects on the environment is an integral part of                  
              Integrated Pest Management (IPM).  Industry support for a IPM                  
              research program has been obtained to establish an                             
              Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Integrated Pest            
              Management at North Carolina State University.                                 
                   The initial research program at the Industry/University                   
              Cooperative Research Center for Integrated Pest Management will                
              address the impact of pest management on environmental quality,                
              crop loss assessment and economic threshold determinations, genetic            
              engineering for improved pest management, improved  understanding              
              of pest biology and ecology, pesticide resistance detection and                
              management, and development of decision support systems for IPM.               
                   The Principal Investigator and his colleagues are                         
              internationally recognized researchers that have the capability and            
              resources to run the Center.                                                   
                   This Center has been coordinated with Dr. F. Heineken, Program            
              Manager of Biotechnology Program.                                              
                   The Program Manager recommends North Carolina State University            
              be awarded $50,000 for the first year of a five-year continuing                
              award.                                                                         
                   Near the end of each 12 month period the Program Manager                  
              and/or the Director of the Engineering Centers Division will review            
              the progress of the Center on a number of criteria, including the              
              following:  (1) the extent to which the university-industry                    
              interaction and collaboration is developing; (2) the extent to                 
              which the support base is expanding; (3) the extent to which a                 
              robust research program is developing.  If the review is                       
              satisfactory, the Program Manager will recommend support of the                
              next period of this continuing award.
