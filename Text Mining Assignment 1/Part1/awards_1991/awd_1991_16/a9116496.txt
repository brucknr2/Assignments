Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a project of fundamental research on the extragalactic                 
              distance scale by one of the leaders in this field.  Using the                 
              latest available instrumentation, the properties of Cepheid                    
              variable stars will be studied both in our galaxy and in several               
              nearby systems.  This will more than double the number of                      
              galaxies which have reddening corrected distance moduli.  It is                
              these calibrated galaxies which are used in the classical                      
              determination of the Hubble constant which in turn measures the                
              scale of the universe in both distance and time.
