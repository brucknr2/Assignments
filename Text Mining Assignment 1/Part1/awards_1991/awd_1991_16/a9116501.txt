Abstract    :
              The Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program in the                     
              Chemistry Division has supported a comprehensive investigation                 
              of curve-crossing events in chemical reactions being carried                   
              out by Professor Guo at the University of Toledo. Professor Guo                
              is conducting a study of non-adiabatic transition dynamics in                  
              the photodissociation of small molecules, including new                        
              three-dimensional quantum mechanical calculations of the                       
              photodissociation dynamics of alkyl iodides in the gas phase.                  
              Professor Guo's new approach treats the dissociation degree of                 
              freedom by a quantum wavepacket method while characterizing                    
              environment motions by classical trajectories.  The quantum and                
              classical subsystems are coupled via the Ehrenfest scheme so                   
              that the wavepacket and the trajectory can be propagated                       
              self-consistently.                                                             
              %%%                                                                            
              Most chemical reactions can be adequately understood as                        
              involving reactant and product molecules in their ground                       
              electronic states.  However, there are many important                          
              reactions, including most processes that are initiated by                      
              ultraviolet radiation, for which the reaction process involves                 
              interaction between the ground and excited electronic states.                  
              A new theoretical method is being tested that should permit                    
              prediction of the probability of such processes and thereby                    
              contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms of processes                 
              initiated by light.
