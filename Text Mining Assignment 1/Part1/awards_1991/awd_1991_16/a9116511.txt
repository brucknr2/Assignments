Abstract    :
                   The award will cover participation of this group of                       
              individuals in studying the physics of the particle                            
              responsible for the weak interaction - the Z0.  The machine                    
              called LEP at CERN in Europe which makes Z0's has been running                 
              now for almost three years, and this group were responsible                    
              for building an important component of the spectrometer called                 
              L3 which is used in the detection of the Z0 decay products.                    
              These decays reveal details of the theoretical "standard                       
              model" for the interactions of nature (including the weak                      
              interaction) with great precision.  The same group also plans                  
              to participate in the design and construction of a future                      
              detector to be used at the SSC accelerator which should be                     
              operational in the next decade, and which should provide clues                 
              to questions for which the standard model has no answers.                      
              Such preparations are necessary at this time, given the large                  
              scale of the SSC project.
