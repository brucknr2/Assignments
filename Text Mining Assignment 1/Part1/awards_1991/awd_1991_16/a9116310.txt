Abstract    :
              Tissue Engineering is a new discipline that has as its                         
              goal the reconstitution of tissues and organs for use as                       
              model systems in basic and applied research as well as for                     
              use as grafts to replace damaged of diseased body parts or                     
              body functions.  The tissues and organs built ex vivo may                      
              consist of living cells combined with extracellular                            
              molecules, or of acellular structures designed to be                           
              remodeled in vivo.  It is perceived that the products of                       
              Tissue Engineering must be standardized and                                    
              quality-controlled.  Regulatory issues related to their                        
              manufacture and use need to be formulated and resolved.                        
              Tissue Engineering is a nascent science and technology                         
              that draws support from many fields, including cell                            
              culture, extracellular matrix biochemistry, cell and                           
              developmental biology, immunology and biomechanics.                            
                                                                                             
              Shaping Tissue Engineering through the synthesis of the                        
              sub-disciplines on which it depends is one of the                              
              objectives of this Conference, which is organized around                       
              challenge topics that attempt to highlight the roles of                        
              the sub-disciplines.  Tissue Engineering has the potential                     
              of accelerating the application of discoveries made in                         
              basic research to useful products for both the laboratory                      
              and the clinic.  How this potential is realized is in                          
              large part the focus of this Conference.
