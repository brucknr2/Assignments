Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research in             
              mantle geochemistry between Gordon Brown and Jonathan Stebbins                 
              of Stanford University and George Calas and Francis Taulelle of                
              the University of Paris VI and VII respectively.  They will study              
              silicate liquids at high temperatures and pressures and trace                  
              elements in silicate minerals.  Drs. Brown and Calas bring to this             
              collaboration their innovative methods in synchrotron based X-ray              
              absorption.  This is complemented by Stebbins and Taulelle's work              
              in high temperature and pressure NMR (Nuclear Magnetic                         
              Resonance) spectroscopy.  The project will benefit from access to              
              advanced facilities at Stanford and in Paris.                                  
                                                                                             
              The project will provide new information on the bonding of                     
              silicate liquids (melts) under simulated upper mantle conditions               
              and the structural role of transition metals in silicate minerals.             
              The results will advance our understanding of the structure-                   
              property relationships of these silicate liquids at high temperatures          
              and pressures. Detailed knowledge of the structure-property                    
              relationships of these liquids and the melting phase, will be vital            
              for understanding the dynamic processes, structure and                         
              compositional zoning within the Earth and other planets.
