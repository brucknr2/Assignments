Abstract    :
              The major goal of the proposed Euro-American Bi-Lateral                        
              Engineering Research Workshop is to enhance effective                          
              interaction between state administrations, local industries                    
              and academic communities in the United States and Europe,                      
              and to provide the appropriate professional framework for                      
              technical discussions of current practice and engineering                      
              research needs. The workshop will focus in the area of                         
              Environmental Geomaterials with special attention to new                       
              technologies and construction materials which ensure long-                     
              term containment performance of engineered pollution                           
              seepage barriers in both constructed environments and                          
              geologic media, for high or low risk radio-active                              
              materials, hazardous wastes and a variety of chemical                          
              contaminants.
