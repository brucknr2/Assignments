Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This three-year award supports U.S-France cooperative research in              
              computational linguistics between James Pustejovsky of Brandeis                
              University and Patrick Saint Dizier of the University Paul Sabatier            
              in Toulouse.  The project addresses research in the semantics of               
              word meaning in natural language processing.  The objective is to              
              combine formal and theoretical work on the representation of word              
              knowledge and then to define a computational framework for                     
              expressing this knowledge.  Dr. Pustejovsky brings to this                     
              collaboration experience in the theory of lexical semantics and                
              natural language representation.  His recent research has provided a           
              contemporary framework for research on lexical knowledge.  This                
              is complemented by the French group's innovative methodology for               
              applying logic programming to natural language processing                      
              problems.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              Lexical semantics, one of the most difficult areas in natural                  
              language processing, requires effective computational tools. This              
              project addresses that problem by combining the complementary                  
              approaches of the U.S. and French investigators.  The results will             
              advance our knowledge of computer linguistics and contribute to                
              the resolution of several practical problems in this field:                    
              information retrieval, interface between humans and computers,                 
              machine translation, dictionary design and electronic document                 
              dissemination.
