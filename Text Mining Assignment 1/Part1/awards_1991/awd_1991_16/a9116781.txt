Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will support a two-year U.S.-Japan cooperative                      
              research project between Professor Lane Hemachandra, Department                
              of Computer Science, University of Rochester, and Professor                    
              Osamu Watanabe, Department of Computer Science, Tokyo                          
              Institute of Technology.  Other investigators involved in the project          
              are Professor Juris Hartmanis, Department of Computer Science,                 
              Cornell University, Professor Kojiro Kobayashi, Department of                  
              Information Sciences, Tokyo Institute of Technology, and                       
              Professors Mitsunori Ogiwara and Seinosuke Toda, both of the                   
              Department of Computer Science and Information Mathematics,                    
              University of Electro-Communications, Tokyo, Japan.                            
                                                                                             
              The project is focused on closure properties of some natural                   
              intermediate complexity classes such as                                        
              The investigators will focus on two areas in complexity theory:  (1)           
              the realtive complexity of seemingly "intermediate" closure                    
              properties of key function classes--properties that seem neither to            
              be possessed by the classes nor to be hard for the classes, and (2)            
              the question of whether all infinite NP sets have infinite sparse              
              subsets that are (relatively) siimple, a question that springs from            
              the study of perfect hash functions.
