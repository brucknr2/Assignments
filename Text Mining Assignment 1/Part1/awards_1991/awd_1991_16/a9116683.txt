Abstract    :
              Fischer         The basic goal of this research is to develop general  analysis
              and design methods for multidimensional filter bank  signal decompositions,
              featuring non-rectangular spectral  partitions, and to integrate such methods
              with novel source  coding techniques to produce a family of effective and
              efficient  image and video coders. The work focuses on the following four 
              tasks:  1.     design exact/near-exact reconstruction multidimensional 
              multirate filter banks for a variety of non-rectangular spectral  partitions; 
              2.     develop a theory for the subband coding gain and coder  performance of
              multidimensional multirate filter bank source  coders, emphasizing the filter
              banks developed in 1;  3.     develop a theory for the influence of perceptual
              weighting  functions in subband coding systems; and  4.     determine a theory
              for the performance of linear prediction  in a multirate filter bank signal
              decomposition, with emphasis on  the source coding application.  Fixed, forward
              adaptive, and  backward adaptive prediction are being considered.
