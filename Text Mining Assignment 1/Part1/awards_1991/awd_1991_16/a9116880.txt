Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Experimental studies to ascertain the influence of hydrogen atoms              
              incorporated during MBE growth of ZnSe on the electrical and                   
              optical properties are conducted.  The ability of hydrogen atoms to            
              neutralize shallow and deep levels in the ZnSe bandgap will be                 
              investigated.  In order to incorporate hydrogen atoms into ZnSe                
              epilayers in a highly controlled way, a UHV-compatible RF plasma               
              discharge free-radical source mounted on the MBE system will be                
              employed rather than a conventional effusion source.  Extensive                
              Hall-effect and photoluminescense measurements will be carried out             
              to characterize the salient optical and electronic properties of               
              the epilayers.                                                                 
              %%%                                                                            
              This research may provide a solution to the general problem of                 
              self-compensation in wide-bandgap compound semiconductors which                
              would represent a major step towards understanding the fundamental             
              nature of these materials and provide the basis for realizing                  
              improved optoelectronic devices operating in the blue spectral                 
              region.
