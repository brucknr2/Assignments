Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Fundamental research on critical interfaces in thin layered                    
              structures formed from oxide films deposited in-situ on various                
              III-V compound semiconductor surfaces with silicon interlayers will            
              be conducted.  The idea being explored is that the III-V/Silicon               
              interface states do not pin the Fermi level, and the Si/SiO2                   
              interface either exhibits a very low density of interface states,              
              or a favorable energy distribution of such states in the gap,                  
              thereby making MOS structures with III-V semiconductors feasible.              
              The objective is to understand basic factors affecting interface               
              state density with these materials and to achieve conditions of                
              sufficiently low(<1011cm-2) values to allow effective surface                  
              potential modulation in III-V metal-oxide-semiconductor(MOS)                   
              structures.                                                                    
              %%%                                                                            
              This research is expected to provide deeper understanding of--and              
              may also provide a long-sought solution to--the control and                    
              manipulation of electronic energy states of compound semiconductors            
              at interface regions of layered structures.  The results could be              
              of particular significance to the technology of large scale, high              
              speed integrated electronic and photonic circuits which consume low            
              power.
