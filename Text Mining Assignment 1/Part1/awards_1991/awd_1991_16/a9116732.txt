Abstract    :
                   This project is to observe deformations along 2500 km of one              
              of the world's most prolific generators of large and great                     
              earthquakes, the Chilean convergent plate margin.  The proposed                
              distribution of regional GPS observing sites is focused on                     
              measurements of deformation of the region immediately above the                
              main interplate seismic zone, but includes stations on the Nazca               
              plate and sites across the Andes to establish the overall plate                
              motions and deformations within the Andean orogen.  This regional              
              GPS network would be observed every two years during six week                  
              campaigns with receivers utilized in a pattern of fixed and leap-              
              frogging mobile deployments.  During the intervening years                     
              subsidiary campaigns mounted using 5 or 6 receivers would implement            
              a program of spatial densification at specially selected parts of              
              the regional network.  Approximately 40-60 sites would abe observed            
              during each subsidiary campaign.  The primary short-term scientific            
              objective is to measure seismic and aseismic deformations in the               
              cycle of major interplate earthquake recurrence in relation to                 
              plate convergence and the tectonics of the subduction zone.  The               
              secondary, longer-term objective is to observe the horizontal and              
              vertical deformations with the forearc and across the Andean                   
              cordillera.  The proposed consortium includes U.S. experts in GPS              
              deployment and data analysis; South American seismicity, tectonics             
              and field operations; and strong ties with Chilean, Argentine and              
              Bolivian scientists and the national geodetic surveys.
