Abstract    :
                   The Committee on National Statistics of the National                      
              Academy of Sciences works to improve the statistical methods                   
              used for analysis in many fields of science.  Its work is                      
              also aimed at upgrading the quality of statistical                             
              information on which important basic research and public                       
              policy decisions are founded.  The committee,  composed of                     
              distinguished statisticians and other scientists of eminence,                  
              identifies problem areas in which statistical questions are                    
              pivotal,  and carries out studies which evaluate these                         
              questions comprehensively and seek to provide feasible                         
              solutions.  Broad support for the committee's developmental                    
              activities and basic operating costs is provided by a                          
              consortium of federal agencies led by the National Science                     
              Foundation.  Each agency contributes an annual sum                             
              proportionate to its interest in the committee's yearly                        
              agenda and the size of its own research budget.  The award                     
              recommended at present represents the foundation's financial                   
              participation in the consortium for Fiscal Year 1991.  The                     
              award also carries notification of the foundation's intention                  
              to contribute a similar amount to the committee's upkeep in                    
              future years,  contingent upon satisfactory progress and the                   
              availability of funds.
