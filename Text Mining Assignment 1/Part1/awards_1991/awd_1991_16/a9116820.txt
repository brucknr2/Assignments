Abstract    :
              The rearrangemnt of N-acyl-2-furylamines to                                    
              N-acyl-3-piperidinones (the "aza-Achmatowicz" reaction) is a                   
              novel, practical method for enantioselective preparation of                    
              nitrogenous substances.  A key step in the technique is the                    
              chemoenzymatic resolution of racemic furylglycine and                          
              furylalanine.  The resolved aminoacids are efficiently                         
              transformed into building blocks for the synthesis of                          
              structures as diverse as azasaccharides, beta-lactams, unusual                 
              aminoacids, glycoside antibiotics, and amphibian alkaloids.                    
                                                                                             
              %%%                                                                            
                                                                                             
              With this award, the Organic Synthesis Program will support the                
              research of Dr. Marco A. Ciufolini at Rice University.  The                    
              research explores new ramifications of an old well-established                 
              nitrogen heterocycle ring-forming reaction which permits                       
              asymmetric control at a crucial stage of the reaction sequence.                
              This is combined with utilization of new organometallic                        
              reagents to generate new synthetic methodology that should                     
              benefit research in biochemistry, medicine, as well as in the                  
              chemical industry.
