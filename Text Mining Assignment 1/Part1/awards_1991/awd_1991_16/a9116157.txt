Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This three-year award supports cooperative research between                    
              Thomas C. Halsey of the University of Chicago and Bertrand                     
              Duplantier of the Theoretical Physics Laboratory at the French                 
              National Center for Scientific Research, Saclay.  The investigators            
              will cooperate on problems in condensed matter physics of                      
              disordered, fractal geometric systems.  Utilizing partial differential         
              equations expressed in terms of random walkers, they will study                
              problems involving conductivity, pattern formation in corrosion and            
              surface impedance at rough semiconductor-metal interfaces.                     
                                                                                             
              Dr. Halsey brings to this collaboration experience in numerical                
              work and scaling arguments for the behavior of random walks near               
              rough surfaces.  He has developed a number of fast numerical                   
              algorithms to address these problems.  This is complemented by the             
              French investigator's analytical background and mathematical                   
              techniques in generating exact results. Their combined efforts in              
              numerics, scaling and exact results will contribute to the solution of         
              these problems.  It will also advance our understanding of the basic           
              physics and chemistry involved in electrical conductivity, corrosion           
              and surface interactions.
