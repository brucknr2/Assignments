Abstract    :
              In this project, the PI will study the principal water masses of               
              the South Atlantic Ocean, and attempt to map their spreading                   
              routes through the basin.  Historical hydrographic data from the               
              National Oceanographic Data Center archive will be augmented by                
              new data from the South Atlantic Ventilation Experiment (SAVE) and             
              the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE), which include new               
              tracer data.  These tracers will allow new interpretations, which              
              were previously inaccessible to temperature and salinity data                  
              alone.
