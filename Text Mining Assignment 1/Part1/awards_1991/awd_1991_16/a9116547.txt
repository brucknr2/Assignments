Abstract    :
              This work contributes to scientific data processing technology                 
              through the development of an extensible toolkit of database                   
              operators to capture, clean and manipulate scientific data, and                
              through the study of mechanisms for interactive, real-time                     
              scientific processing, such as parallelization and flow control.               
              This work builds on the experience of the research team in                     
              gathering and processing spacecraft data and in developing                     
              extensible database technologies as part of the Volcano project.               
              The team includes a graduate student in computer science who has               
              worked extensively at the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space                 
              Physics (LASP) of the University of Colorado on spacecraft                     
              operations and data management projects.  The focus of this                    
              project is on the development of new database technologies which               
              can be accomplished by combining real-time and database query                  
              processing techniques.  The key results of this work will                      
              include:  (1) techniques for enhancing the responsiveness of                   
              database query operations, (2) tools to enable a scientist to                  
              capture and process huge amounts of scientific data such as those              
              received from a spacecraft, and to process these data                          
              interactively, and (3) an extensible toolkit of database                       
              operations (such as capture, clean, relate, manipulate, and                    
              display scientific data sets) to facilitate analysis of the                    
              complex data sets required to understand complex scientific                    
              issues such as global ozone depletion.
