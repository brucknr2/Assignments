Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The proposed work consists of testing the hypothesis that                      
              recruitment pulses to rocky intertidal barnacle populations are                
              caused by the collision of upwelling fronts with the rocky                     
              intertidal zone.  It is hypothesized that the upwelling front is a             
              place of convergence, and that larvae of intertidal barnacles                  
              accumulate there.  To test this hypothesis, knowledge of the                   
              temporal history of the position and vertical structure of an                  
              upwelling front is required, along with knowledge of the                       
              distribution and abundance of larvae in the water column, and their            
              recruitment success during periods of active upwelling and                     
              relaxation from upwelling.  The PIs propose to address this issue              
              through a series of field measurements consisting of: (1) use of               
              shipboard net tows together with temperature, salinity, and                    
              velocity measurements along a transect off Monterey, California, on            
              six short cruises during each of two upwelling seasons; (2) moored             
              measurements of temperature and wind; (3) benthic monitoring in the            
              intertidal zone; (4) shore-based measurements of temperature and               
              salinity; and, (5) satellite AVHRR data.
