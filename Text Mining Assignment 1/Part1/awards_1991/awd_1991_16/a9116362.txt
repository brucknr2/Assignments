Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Fundamental research directed toward improved understanding of                 
              atomistic processes and structure in semiconductors and their                  
              surfaces will be conducted.  The atomistics of dislocation motion              
              in semiconductors will be studied using real-time atomic                       
              resolution transmission electron microscope video recordings of                
              dislocation kink motion. The research aims to understand the                   
              correlation between kink motions on different moving partial                   
              dislocations, the nature of obstacles to kink motion, and their                
              density and waiting times.  Also, the early stages of the growth               
              of SiGe alloys on silicon will be studied by ultrahigh vacuum                  
              transmission electron diffraction.  The research seeks to                      
              determine the atomic coordinates for low coverage Ge on Si(111)                
              surface structures, and in comparing the results with scanning                 
              tunneling microscope(STM) work.                                                
              %%%                                                                            
              This research is expected to provide deeper fundamental                        
              understanding of atomic interactions and their relationship to                 
              defects, defect motion, and early stages of epitaxial crystal                  
              growth.  From an application point of view, understanding these                
              properties is helpful to semiconductor device design and                       
              fabrication.  The results will be of importance in a general way               
              to the technology of large scale, high speed integrated                        
              electronic circuits.
