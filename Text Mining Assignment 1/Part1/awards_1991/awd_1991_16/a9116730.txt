Abstract    :
                   Magnetic resonance spectra, used in scientific, engineering               
              and medical research, depart from pure Lorentzian behavior in the              
              presence of inhomogeneities such as those commonly encountered in              
              many of these applications.  This research will develop                        
              appropriate analytic methods using statistical theory drawn from               
              semiparametric model analysis.  This new methodology will be                   
              derived to remove distortions caused by magnetic field                         
              inhomogeneity and by temporal instability.  Also, statistical                  
              theory and methodology will be developed to analyze repeated                   
              observations such as those taken to identify and study metabolic               
              changes at intervals during an extended period of time.
