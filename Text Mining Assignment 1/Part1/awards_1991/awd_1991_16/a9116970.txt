Abstract    :
              This purpose of this effort is to support the American Society for             
              Engineering Education (ASEE) in establishing and perpetuating a                
              scholarly journal dedicated to research in engineering education.              
              The award is for $223,198. Establishing a high-quality, peer-                  
              reviewed journal  dedicated to encouraging scholarly research in               
              engineering education and disseminating that research widely will              
              make a lasting contribution to the discipline.  By publishing                  
              current research on curriculum reform, faculty development, and                
              other areas of vital concern, this journal will help to improve the            
              quality of engineering education in the United States.
