Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              High-density coverage of peridotite samples collected by the PI                
              during U.S. and Russian cruises between 0 and 15 deg N on the Mid              
              Atlantic Ridge will be analyzed.  This will allow the study of                 
              small scale heterogeneities in major elemental chemistry on                    
              olivine, amphibole and plagioclase.  The data will provide                     
              information about variations in initial composition, degree of                 
              partial melting and thermal structure of the upper mantle.
