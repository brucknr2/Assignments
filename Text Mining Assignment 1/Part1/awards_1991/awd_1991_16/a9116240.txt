Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will support collaborative research between Robert                  
              Bernheim, Pennsylvania State University, and Paola Bicchi,                     
              University of Siena, Italy.  This project is directed toward three             
              areas of molecular and laser spectroscopy that have evolved out of             
              previous contacts with scientists from Pisa, Siena, and Florence.              
              The objectives of the research collaboration are threefold:  laser-            
              induced shifts in chemical equilibrium; molecular spectroscopy of              
              vapors of the Group III Elements:  Ga, In, Tl; and cooperative                 
              fluorescence studies of translational recoil of photodissociation              
              products.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              The equilibrium shift studies are of fundamental importance as they            
              provide unambiguous evidence for the use of lasers to "guide"                  
              chemical reactions.  The collaboration will seek to extend this                
              remarkable effect to chemical systems other than alkali metal                  
              vapors, possibly even to a stabilized vapor of H-atoms.  The                   
              proposed studies of molecules such as In2 will reveal the potential            
              of these systems for active gain media for visible and uv eximer               
              lasers.  Cooperative fluorescence studies will provide an alternative          
              method for the investigation of translational energy partitioning              
              resulting from photodissociation processes.  The major benefit of              
              the collaboration is the sharing of equipment -- a Bomem Fourier               
              transform spectrometer at Penn State; a tunable mode-locked laser              
              system and proper detection apparatus for quantum beat                         
              experiments in Florence; and tunable, pulsed and CW dye lasers in              
              all locations where researchers with special skills and expertise              
              make use of special variations.  One of the major benefits of this             
              work will be the stimulation of international activity in the field of         
              laser-guided chemistry.  Furthermore, the cooperative fluorescence             
              method is a powerful, but unused, tool for studies of molecular                
              dynamics.
