Abstract    :
                   Professor Wallach will continue his research in the general               
              area of group representation theory.  In particular his research               
              will involve a generalization of the Kuznetsov formula and the                 
              Laplacian on locally symmetric spaces.  In addition he will study              
              the asymptotic behavior of Whittaker functionals in the theory of              
              the Toda lattice and further projects in the area of direct                    
              integral decompositions of reducible real reductive groups.                    
                   Group theory is basically the theory of symmetry.  To take a              
              simple example, when the system in question is invariant under a               
              change in the position of the origin of space, the group of                    
              translations naturally arises.  While groups are abstract                      
              objects, particular situations demand concrete realizations or                 
              "representations" of the symmetry group.  Professor Wallach's                  
              investigations involve representations of groups which have                    
              geometrical or physical content.
