Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator (PI) will study dynamic and                    
              stochastic scheduling (allocation), synchronization                            
              (coordination), and concurrency aspects of communication systems,              
              especially those related to networking, multi-accessing, and                   
              service integration.  He will acquire a basic theoretical                      
              understanding of how these issues emerging at the level of                     
              elementary operations, affect the macroscopic performance of                   
              communication networks.  Based on that he will address the design              
              (synthesis) of efficient operational schemes (protocols,                       
              policies) for the optimization of networks with respect to                     
              criteria concerning throughput, message delays, blocking                       
              probabilities, fairness, load balancing, and reliability.                      
                   In addition, the PI will create a unified framework                       
              emphasizing rigorous mathematics for studying basic prototypical               
              models, extracted from various practical situations involving                  
              scheduling and synchronization in communication networks.  New                 
              powerful queueing models will be developed to capture essential                
              features of concurrency and synchronization, extending classical               
              queueing theory and allowing the systematic analysis of the                    
              dynamics and performance of protocols.  Real-time scheduling and               
              resource allocation schemes will be studied in a natural                       
              stochastic framework.   In cases where the relevant optimal                    
              scheduling algorithms are of high complexity, the focus will be                
              on exploring simple (low complexity) scheduling schemes of                     
              operations to improve the performance.  Other aspects of dynamic               
              scheduling will also be examined, if necessary by simulation.
