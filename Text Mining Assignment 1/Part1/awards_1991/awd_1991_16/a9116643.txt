Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award supports the participation of nine U.S. scientists in a             
              U.S.-Japan Seminar on Magnetic Multilayered Structures, to be                  
              held May 15-17, 1992 in Honolulu, Hawaii.  The co-organizers of                
              the seminar are Professor Peter Levy, Department of Physics, New               
              York University, and Professor Hiroyasu Fujimori, Institute for                
              Materials Research, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan.  Among the               
              topics to be covered are:  (1) preparation and characterization of             
              metallic multilayered structures and magneto-optics, (2)                       
              experimental and theoretical studies of their basic properties, e.g.,          
              phase transitions, interface magnetism (two-dimensional), magnetic             
              anisotropy, and interlayer magnetic coupling, and (3) novel                    
              properties and technical applications, soft magnetic films, and giant          
              magnetoresistance materials.                                                   
                                                                                             
              Magnetic and metallic multilayered structures are a subcategory of             
              the broader field of thin film research.  The seminar participants             
              have been chosen to cover some of the most impressive recent                   
              advances.  These advances promote our knowledge of the                         
              microscopic interactions that control the properties of these                  
              structures and in addition they serve as a guide for the development           
              of multilayered materials for such technologies as magnetic                    
              recording, information storage, and magneto-optical recording.
