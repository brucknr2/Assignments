Abstract    :
              The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) is                       
              establishing the Support for Under-Represented Groups in                       
              Engineering (SURGE) program within the College of Engineering.  The            
              college leads the nation in total degrees conferred and is                     
              recognized as a major international center of excellence in both               
              undergraduate and graduate education, offering an array of research            
              opportunities unmatched in scope and quality.  A comprehensive                 
              package of financial incentives and programmatic services and                  
              activities will be aimed at recruiting persons from                            
              underrepresented groups into a PhD program and supporting them to              
              degree completion.  SURGE will admit ten new participants each year            
              and provide support to each for five years.  The SURGE pipeline                
              will reach steady-state capacity of 40 in the fifth year.  SURGE               
              will increase Black and Hispanic enrollment in all doctoral                    
              programs by 300% and also increase the number of women and persons             
              with disabilities.  In each participant's first year, SURGE will               
              provide a $15,000 stipend (with no requirement of service) and                 
              payment of tuition and fees.  In subsequent years SURGE will                   
              supplement the teaching or research assistantships up to the                   
              $15,000 per year level.
