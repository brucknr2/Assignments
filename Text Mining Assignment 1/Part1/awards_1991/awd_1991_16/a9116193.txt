Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The principal investigator and his students have                          
              recently developed the NUVEL-1 global plate motion model.  This                
              project will build on NUVEL-1 to obtain new global models                      
              for geologically current 'absolute' plate motion, i.e., the                    
              motion of the plates relative to reference frames external to any              
              one plate.  The models will include a description of plate                     
              motion relative to the hotspots and plate motion relative to                   
              various no-net-torque reference frames, including the reference                
              frame in which there is no net rotation of the lithosphere.  New               
              methods for calculating the errors in no-net-rotation and                      
              no-net-torque models will be formulated.
