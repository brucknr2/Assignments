Abstract    :
                   There is an urgent need for techniques to identify and                    
              quantify many types of small marine eukaryotes.  Current                       
              knowledge of population dynamics is limited to a small percentage              
              of the microbial community, due to the difficulties involved with              
              culturing and identifying marine microeukaryotes.  These problems              
              in community analysis can be resolved with tools that are being                
              developed through advances in molecular biology.                               
                   Objectives of the investigation are to develop non-                       
              radioactive probes for rapid analyses of populations of yeasts.                
              Three types of probes will be developed to determine the                       
              relative abundance of yeast populations within the eukaryotic                  
              community: a universal eukaryote probe, a universal yeast probe                
              and species specific probes.  Dr. Fell will experiment with                    
              chemiluminescent, fluorescent and biotin labeled probes.  These                
              probes will be tested in the laboratory and in the field.
