Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This energy dispersive x-ray analyzer will convert the current                 
              electron microscope at Marquette University into an analytical                 
              microscope capable of chemical analysis of elements with atomic                
              numbers greater or equal to 4, and capable of analyzing areas as               
              small as 20 nm in diameter. The analyzer will be used in studies of            
              diffusion induced grain boundary migration, liquid film migration              
              in binary alloy systems to determine the alloy element                         
              concentration profiles behind boundaries and liquid films which                
              have migrated; characterization studies of metal-oxide                         
              varistorboundary regions and phases; and characterization of                   
              microsegregation of metallic elements in rapidly solidified                    
              superconductors.  In addition, students will be trained on this                
              instrument.  The analyzer will be shared by three groups, and made             
              available to other users in engineering, physics, and chemistry on             
              the campus, as well as interested local industrial groups.
