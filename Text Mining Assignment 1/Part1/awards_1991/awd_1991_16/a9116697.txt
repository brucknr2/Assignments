Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              A major goal of the National Science Foundation is to serve as a               
              catalyst in helping to increase the number of minority Ph.D.s in               
              the sciences.  In order to accomplish this goal,  NSF must first               
              become better informed of the barriers that beset minority                     
              scientists already in the pipeline.  Attendance at the workshop                
              will be open to everyone.  The purpose of this workshop is to                  
              provide a framework that can serve as an operating model at the                
              program level.  The eleven participants are already role models at             
              their respective institutions and will share their experiences with            
              the scientific community.  They are also principal investigators               
              of NSF research awards.  The charge to them is to suggest a                    
              feasible plan that will be available to everyone.//
