Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research in             
              condensed matter physics between Jean Toulouse of Lehigh                       
              University and Michel Rousseau, University of Maine in LeMans,                 
              France.  The investigators will study structural phase transitions             
              fluorides with perovskite structure.  The objectives of their                  
              collaboration are to investigate the physical mechanism involved in            
              structural phase transitions (SPT) and to understand the properties            
              of these materials during the phase transitions.  The Lehigh group             
              brings to this collaboration a solid background in defect studies and          
              experience in ultrasonic, dielectric and spectroscopic experimental            
              techniques.  This is complemented by the French investigators                  
              expertise in neutron scattering and x-ray studies and their ability to         
              grow high quality crystals.                                                    
                                                                                             
              Structural phase transition in mixed systems, especially oxides, is            
              an area of considerable current interest.  Mixed systems are                   
              important to the development of high Tc superconductors, optical               
              materials and structural materials.  Further knowledge about the               
              effects of structural phase transition on the composition of materials         
              could lead to the development of improved, high performance                    
              materials.
