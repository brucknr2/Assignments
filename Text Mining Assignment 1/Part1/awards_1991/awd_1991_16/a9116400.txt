Abstract    :
                   This grant supports the travel of two minority high                       
              school students and their chaperon from Benjamin Banneker                      
              High School in Washington, DC to the Computer Museum in                        
              Boston, MA.  The purpose of the trip is to reward the winners                  
              of the NSF/Banneker Computer Contest with an experience which                  
              exposes them to scientists and new technology in the computer                  
              and information sciences.  Benjamin Banneker High School is                    
              the NSF partnership school.  During the six weeks prior to                     
              National Science and Technology Week a computer programming                    
              contest was conducted at Benjamin Banneker High School.  The                   
              contest was open to all students and about 20 participated.                    
              There were five finalists and two were selected by a panel of                  
              judges from NSF as grand prize winners.  Dr. Strimpel of the                   
              Computer Museum will host the visit.  The students will be                     
              given a tour of the Museum facilities as well as the Boston                    
              University Center for Computational Science, where they will                   
              meet several people working in computational science.//
