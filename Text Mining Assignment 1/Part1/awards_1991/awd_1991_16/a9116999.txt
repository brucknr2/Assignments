Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is the development of an object                  
              oriented database system for supporting application programs used              
              by scientists involved in the rational design of therapeutic                   
              agents and studies of specific interactions in peptides and                    
              proteins. This work is focused specifically on the data storage                
              and access requirements this class of applications, and is the                 
              outgrowth of one component of a project much larger in scope                   
              entitled "Macromolecular Workbench: Computer-Assisted Analysis of              
              Protein Design and Function" supported by DARPA. Specific work                 
              includes refinement of the data communications protocol used                   
              between the Macromolecular Workbench (MMWB) data manager module                
              and object file access library, as well as reimplementation of                 
              the data manager in the C++ programming language in order to take              
              advantage of the natural correspondence between scientific data                
              and actions performed on this data as specified in the original                
              MMWB data manager design.  The design provides for a unified user              
              interface and machine independent object oriented data access.                 
              The result of this project will have significant impact on other               
              scientific applications software, and therefore on the scientific              
              community as a whole, as this software will now be able to take                
              advantage of a unified database system, thereby making possible a              
              "toolkit" of scientific software with each tool capable of                     
              simultaneously directly manipulating common shared data.
