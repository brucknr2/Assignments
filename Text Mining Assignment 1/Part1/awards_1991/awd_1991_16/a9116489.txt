Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The goal of the research is the experimental determination of                  
              the heat transfer and friction characteristics of internal                     
              flow in rectangular channels of different aspect ratios with                   
              one, two and four rib-roughened walls.  The data will be used                  
              to evaluate a model for predicting the enhanced heat transfer                  
              performance.  Such flow configurations are important for gas                   
              turbine heat transfer and other applications.
