Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Recent calculations indicate that the recycled biogenic flux              
              of trace metals in surface seawater should overwhelm all other                 
              inputs.  In order to address the question of the biological cycling            
              of trace metals in surface seawater, this project will expand on               
              the principal investigator's research on metal uptake by                       
              phytoplankton to study metal uptake by bacteria and the role of                
              bacteria in the  remineralization of biogenic metal compounds.                 
              This research will include studies of the kinetics of algal and                
              bacterial uptake of Fe, Zn, Cu, Ni, Co, and Cd, and the                        
              identification of metal uptake and metal storage compounds as well             
              as metalloproteins, and the quantification of the mechanisms                   
              responsible for the release of the metals from these compounds.
