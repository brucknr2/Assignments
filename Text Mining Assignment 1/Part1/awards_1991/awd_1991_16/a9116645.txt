Abstract    :
              The orifice pulse tube refrigerator is a cryogenic                             
              refrigerator capable of achieving useful refrigeration at                      
              liquid nitrogen temperatures (77 K).  The high mass flow rates                 
              in this refrigerator reduces performance due to ineffective                    
              heat exchange in the refrigerator.  An apparatus has been                      
              constructed to study the ineffectiveness of a regenerative                     
              heat exchanger in a working pulse tube refrigerator.  The                      
              apparatus will allow evaluation of different refrigerator                      
              materials and configurations.  A model will be developed which                 
              will include the pressure and mass flow oscillations of this                   
              system.  Measurements taken with the test apparatus will allow                 
              for model verification and identification of important                         
              operation parameters.
