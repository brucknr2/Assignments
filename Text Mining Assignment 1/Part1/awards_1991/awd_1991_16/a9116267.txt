Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research will formulate and estimate a dynamic model of                   
              the engineering labor market since 1950, based on a model of                   
              stock-flow adjustment of engineers to changing market                          
              conditions.  It will use annual Current Population Survey data                 
              special tabulations (adjusted for age and other                                
              characteristics) to investigate how expected career earnings                   
              prospects in engineering compared with other occupations                       
              determine entry decisions.  It will also investigate the                       
              effects of changing demand conditions on entry, using such                     
              variables as research and development spending and overall                     
              level of economic activity and national defense expenditures.                  
              It will also examine the effect of changing cohort sizes for                   
              the period 1950 to 1990.//
