Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This work involves a short cruise off northern                            
              BajaCalifornia where the Miocene East Pacific Rise flank                       
              containsare cord of the orgin and demise of short transfrom                    
              offsets ofthe rise crest, and extensional and compressional                    
              effects of plate motion changes on the structure of major,                     
              long-lived tranforms. The Seabeam 2000 multibeam sonar sounder, a              
              single-channel profiler, and a magetometer will be the                         
              principal survey tools. Results will be applicable to studies of               
              the evolution of rise-crest segmentation.
