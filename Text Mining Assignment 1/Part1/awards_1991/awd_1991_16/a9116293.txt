Abstract    :
                   This project will support a special year in general topology              
              to be held at Kansas State University.  The focus of the special               
              year will be on areas in general topology which include the                    
              topology of function spaces, which relates general topology to                 
              analysis and descriptive set theory.  In particular, there will                
              be an emphasis on cleavability, a generalization of one-one                    
              continuous functions, which is applicable to different areas of                
              topology such as abstract spaces and continua theory.                          
                The special year will consist of a semester-long visit                       
              sponsored by Kansas State University of Professor A.V.                         
              Arhangel'skii of Moscow University, a joint topology seminar held              
              jointly with the University of Kansas, short-term visits by                    
              researchers in topology and, finally, a short conference on                    
              topology.  This conference, to be held January 3-6, 1992, will                 
              feature a major series of lectures on the concept of cleavability              
              of a topological space and talks on general topology.
