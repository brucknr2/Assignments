Abstract    :
              Dr. Rabindra N. Roy of the Chemistry Department of Drury                       
              College is being supported to involve two undergraduate                        
              students in a summer research experience in 1991.  The students                
              will spend ten weeks in a program for determining the acidic                   
              dissociation constants of seawater-carbonate systems using pH                  
              measurements.
