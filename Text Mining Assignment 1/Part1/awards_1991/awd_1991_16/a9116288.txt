Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              Previous research has demonstrated the widespread occurrence of                
              microbially mediated aerobic and anaerobic diagenesis within                   
              marine carbonate frameworks such as coral reefs.  In these                     
              sedimentary systems, advective and turbulent water flow, rather                
              than diffusion, dominates the exchange of dissolved material                   
              between the framework interstitial water and the overlying                     
              seawater.  Nevertheless, diagenesis is rapid enough to result in               
              elevated concentrations of end products such as inorganic                      
              nutrients and H2S.  The overall fluxes of diagenetic end products              
              from a reef framework to the neighboring environment will be                   
              determined.  Work will be done to 1) extend the spatial scale of               
              the interstitial water sampling at Checker Reef, Oahu to examine               
              in detail the upper 1 m of the reef framework; 2) directly                     
              measure the advective and diffusive fluxes of diagenetic                       
              reactants and products between the reef framework and the                      
              surrounding environment at several points across the reef; 3)                  
              collect data to calibrate a hydrological model of the advection                
              of interstitial water within the reef; 4) continue measurements                
              of the spatial and temporal distribution or inorganic and organic              
              diagenetic reactants/products within the reef, with particular                 
              attention to short-chain organic nitrogen compounds; and 5) use                
              the concentration data from item 4) with the hydrological model                
              to estimate the rates of organic and inorganic diagenetic                      
              reactions occurring within the reef framework.
