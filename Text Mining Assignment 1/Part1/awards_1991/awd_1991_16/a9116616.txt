Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will support a two-year U.S.-Japan cooperative                      
              research project between Professor V. Ralph Algazi, Department of              
              Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California,                 
              Davis, and Professor Yasuhiko Yasuda, Institute of Industrial                  
              Science, University of Tokyo.  Other scientists involved in this               
              collaboration are Professors Gary Ford and Todd Reed of the                    
              University of California, Davis, and two scientists from the                   
              Nagaoka University of Technology, Niigata (Professor Makoto                    
              Miyahara and Kazumori Kotani) and two scientists from the Tokyo                
              Institute of Technology (Professors Shigeo Tsujii and Yoshinori                
              Sakai).                                                                        
                                                                                             
              The research focuses on areas pertinent to high quality image and              
              video analysis, processing, transmission, recording, storage, and              
              display for natural and computer generated images, and the use of              
              high speed multimedia networks in an integrated digital system                 
              environment.  The commercial growth of High Definition                         
              Television (HDTV) will support this development by providing                   
              components and subsystems at new levels of quality and                         
              performance and at decreasing costs.  As a result of this project,             
              researchers at UC Davis and the two Japanese universities hope to              
              develop a framework for future interaction, using network                      
              communications with specialized equipment, and to pursue other                 
              research topics in high quality imaging and coding.
