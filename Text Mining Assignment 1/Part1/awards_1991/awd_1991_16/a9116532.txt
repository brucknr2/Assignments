Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              In this experimental research an induced backflow will be                      
              utilized to control turbulence and mixing in the mixing region                 
              of a circular jet. The scheme utilises the difference between                  
              global and local instabilities. Backflow will be locally                       
              induced by applying suction to the jet periphery. The research                 
              will also explore the connection between local/global                          
              stability properties                                                           
              and two-and three-dimensional vortex dynamics.                                 
                                                                                             
              This research is motivated by recent observations that                         
              counterflow can be effectively used to either suppress or                      
              enhance turbulence in mixing layers.
