Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry at Duke University will use this                   
              award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program and                  
              the Instrumentation and Instrument Development Program to help                 
              acquire a mass spectrometer system.  The areas of chemical                     
              research that will be enhanced by the acquisition include the                  
              following:                                                                     
                                                                                             
              1.  Free Radical Reactive Intermediates and Free Radical                       
                   Biology.                                                                  
              2.  Synthesis and Analysis of Biologically Important                           
                   Oligosaccharides.                                                         
              3.  Protonated Base Pairs, Cytosine Deamination, and Cross-                    
                   Strand Mutagenesis.                                                       
              4.  Boron Containing Nucleosides and Nucleotides.                              
              5.  Molecular Metaphors and Enzyme Inhibitors.                                 
              6.  Biodegradation of Environmental Contaminants Using White                   
                   Rock Fungus.                                                              
              7.  Identification of the Toxic Metabolites Formed from                        
                   Environmental Contaminants.                                               
                                                                                             
              Mass spectrometry is a technique used to probe intimate                        
              structural details and to obtain the molecular compositions of                 
              a vast array of organic, bioorganic and organometallic                         
              molecules.  When combined with a gas chromatograph, the                        
              resulting system affords the chemist one of the most powerful                  
              tools available for the separation and characterization of                     
              compounds.  The acquisition of a mass spectrometer is essential                
              for the prosecution of frontier research in many fields in                     
              chemistry.
