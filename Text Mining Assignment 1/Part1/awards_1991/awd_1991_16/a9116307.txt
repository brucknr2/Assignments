Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Herbivorous opisthobranch molluscs such as sea hares have been                 
              a rich source of interesting secondary metabolites with                        
              potential biomedical applications.  Hypotheses concerning the                  
              natural function of these compounds have been extant over the                  
              past two decades.  However, our understanding of how these                     
              compounds mediate algal-opisthobranch-predator interactions is                 
              still very poor.  The research proposed here will address 1)                   
              whether feeding by herbivorous opisthobranchs is deterred by                   
              algal secondary metabolites, 2) whether herbivorous                            
              opisthobranchs can sequester secondary metabolites only from                   
              algae that they normally consume, 3) whether secondary                         
              metabolites are distributed within herbivorous opisthobranchs                  
              so as to maximize their potential for deterring predators; or,                 
              alternatively, so as to minimize their toxic effect upon the                   
              opisthobranch, and 4) whether patterns of selective                            
              sequestration and modification of algal metabolites are most                   
              compatable with a) maximizing defensive properties of the                      
              opisthobranch, or b) minimizing toxic effects to the                           
              opisthobranch.  The results of this research will advance our                  
              understanding of the ecology of herbivores that sequester plant                
              secondary metabolites.
