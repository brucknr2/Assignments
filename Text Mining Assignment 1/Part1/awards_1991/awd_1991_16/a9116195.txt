Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Dr. Popp proposes to acquire a gas chromatography-combustion                   
              interface through this grant.  This unit will be part of a mass                
              spectrometer system requested through a proposal (91-17610) to                 
              the Division of Earth Sciences (EAR).  The equipment requested                 
              will provide the ability to analyze carbon, oxygen, nitrogen,                  
              sulfur, and hydrogen isotopic compounds.  To-date, this type of                
              equipment has not been widely applied for oceanographic research.              
                                                                                             
              Matching funds from the University of Hawaii will be provided to               
              purchase the entire system.  This proposal offers a chance to                  
              apply a new technology and opens the technology for shared-use                 
              among many oceanographers.  As one reviewer stated "This is a                  
              modest request of Ocean Sciences and one which will pay many                   
              returns".
