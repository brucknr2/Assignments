Abstract    :
              Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory (RMBL) is establishing a                  
              connection to NSFNET via a privately-owned telephone line through              
              the Colorado SUPERNET and WESTNET mid-level networks.  The                     
              connection enables collaboration between researchers at RMBL and               
              colleagues at their home institutions and elsewhere throughout the             
              Internet.  This award funds four 9600 baud modems capable of speeds            
              up to 38,400 bits per second.
