Abstract    :
                   The research will develop performance analysis tools and                  
              methodologies for congestion control protocols in computer                     
              networks.  The work includes a detailed study of a Fokker-Planck               
              system, developed by the principal investigator in previous work,              
              using finite difference schemes to solve the Fokker-Planck                     
              equations more efficiently and accurately.  The study will include             
              delayed feedback in the system, a detailed study of time series                
              models of the Internet round trip delays.  It will also include an             
              investigation of statistical models correlating round trip delays              
              with network congestion, a mapping of the real world network                   
              parameters, and a comparison of alterative flow control protocols,             
              including both rate based window based algorithms.  The rate based             
              algorithms planned for this study are the Dynamic Time Window                  
              Protocol, dynamic version of the Leaky Bucket Protocol and the                 
              Packet Pair Protocol.  The switch schedules will be varied across              
              Fair Queueing, Virtual Clock, Generalized Virtual Clock.  Non-work-            
              conserving versions of Generalized Virtual Clock, FCFS Drop Tail               
              and FCFS Random Drop.
