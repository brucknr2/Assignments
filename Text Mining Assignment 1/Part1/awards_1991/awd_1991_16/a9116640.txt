Abstract    :
                Users at all levels of expertise prefer to learn software tools              
              by exploration.  However, our knowledge of how users explore                   
              system, and how exploration can lead to effective learning,                    
              remains limited.  In this work studies are made of learning by                 
              exploration looking at factors that lead to retention as measured              
              by the time saved in performing similar tasks repeatedly and for               
              different task instructions intended to promote different modes                
              of exploration.   A theoretical model of the cognitive processes               
              involved in exploration is extended to account for the differing               
              patterns of explorations and to model the consequences if the                  
              various kinds if exploration for retention,.  The results will be              
              incorporated into a software design methodology using the                      
              cognitive walkthrough approach for tools that can be                           
              effectivelymastered through exploration.
