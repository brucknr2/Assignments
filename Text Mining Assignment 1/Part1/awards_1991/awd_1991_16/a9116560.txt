Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Daylength and other photoperiodic cues regulate                           
              reproduction of many animals in shallow-water marine habitats.                 
              The depth to which such cues are important in the sea has not                  
              been investigated, but it is known that numerous deep-sea and                  
              bathyal invertebrates also reproduce seasonally.  Seasonal                     
              reproduction in these species correlates with numerous                         
              potential environmental signals, including seasonal flux of                    
              nutrients, but the actual cues that entrain seasonal                           
              reproductive cycles have not been investigated experimentally                  
              for any deep-sea invertebrate.  Using submersibles, Dr. Young                  
              will test two potential factors that could control reproduction                
              in bathyal echinoids living on the slope in tropical seas:                     
              seasonal flux of macrophytic detritus, and daylength cycles at                 
              very low light intensities.  He will also investigate the                      
              relationship between food supply, growth, fecundity, and timing                
              of reproduction using in situ experiments in which food is                     
              manipulated in enclosures on the sea floor.
