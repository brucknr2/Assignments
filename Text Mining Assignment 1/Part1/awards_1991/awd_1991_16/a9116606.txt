Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal requests funding to design, construct and document               
              instrumentation to measure in situ geothermal/hydrogeological                  
              parameters in the upper 10 meters of deep seafloor sediments.  The             
              measurements will include the vertical geothermal gradient,                    
              vertical pore pressure gradient, and temperature/thermal                       
              conductivity and will be taken by repeated (pogo) penetration of a             
              probe tethered with a standard oceanographic cable.  A two-way                 
              acoustic data link between the ship and the instrument will also be            
              developed.  This instrumentation will support ongoing scientific               
              research programs investigating the hydrogeological nature of the              
              ocean floor such as the Ocean Drilling Program and RIDGE.
