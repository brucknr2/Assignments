Abstract    :
                   Bdellovibrio is unique among procaryotes in its obligate                  
              parasitism and predation of certain other bacteria.  Since                     
              predation by Bdellovibrio destroys the prey bacterium, it has                  
              been postulated that the predator may function as a biological                 
              control agent.  This view is not universally accepted and the                  
              role of Bdellovibrio in nature remains a mystery.  The small size              
              and low numbers of Bdellovibrio in the aquatic environments                    
              previously studied have exacerbated ecological investigations of               
              the predator.  Studies by Dr. WIlliams have revealed that                      
              Bdellovibrio are recovered in large numbers from surface biofilm.              
              The nature of the association of the predators with surfaces is                
              the basis for this study.  The objectives are: I) to determine                 
              the nature of the association of Bdellovibrio with surfaces and                
              those environmental factors which affect the association.  II) to              
              characterize the effects of Bdellovibrio on the formation and                  
              integrity of surface biofilms and III) to demonstrate the                      
              usefulness of surface microbial biofilm as a model for the study               
              of Bdellovibrio.  The interaction of Bdellovibrio with other                   
              biofilm bacteria may reveal the potential of the predator in the               
              control of susceptible bacterial populations.
