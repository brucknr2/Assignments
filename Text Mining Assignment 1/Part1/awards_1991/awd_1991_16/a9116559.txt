Abstract    :
                   Recent work in the western U.S. Cordillera has focussed on                
              possible substantial Mesozoic displacement on faults between the               
              Sierra Nevada and the western Great Basin.  However, the location,             
              timing and sense of movement on these faults is poorly constrained.            
              One of these, the Pine Nut fault in western Nevada, juxtaposes two             
              coeval Mesozoic assemblages that have very different structural                
              histories.  This study will use an integrated structural,                      
              paleomagnetic, geochronologic and geothermobarometric approach to              
              constrain the kinematic history of the Pine Nut fault.  The results            
              will clarify the late Mesozoic tectonic evolution of the western               
              Cordillera, and will have broad implications for displacement field            
              partitioning in active plate margin settings.
