Abstract    :
              The field of uncertainty modeling and analysis is currently in the             
              definitive state of intense research activity in almost all                    
              disciplines of engineering.  Probabilistic methods, Bayesian                   
              approached, theory of evidence, statistical techniques as well as              
              fuzzy logic and reasoning are currently being used by researchers              
              to deal with uncertainty.  Some of these methods are used by almost            
              all sectors of the U.S. research community, whereas other new                  
              methods continue to be mostly used by U.S. researchers in academic             
              institutions.  On the other hand, in other countries, especially               
              Japan, researchers and engineers are currently using all these                 
              methods more effectively in many engineering applications.  The                
              International Symposium on Uncertainty Modeling and Analysis will              
              provide the opportunity and need stimuulus for U.S. researchers                
              and engineers to interact with researchers and engineers from other            
              countries.
