Abstract    :
                This research is to extend previous research on Hawaiian                     
              earthquakes and tectonics to the north part of the island of Hawaii            
              and to the rest of the Hawaiian archipelago.  These areas are less             
              active seismically  than those studied thus far, and no tectonic               
              models exist explaining the presence of earthquakes.  The previous             
              study analyzed 250 fault-plane solutions for earthquakes in Kaoiki             
              (between the two volcanoes Kilauea and Mauna Loa), in Kilea (the               
              meizoseismal area of the great earthquake of 1868), and west                   
              Hawaii.  The resulting estimation of stress directions and tectonic            
              models bear on the question of seismic hazard in the Hawaiian                  
              island chain.  This research is a component of the National                    
              Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
