Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will support the participation of ten U.S. scientists in a          
              U.S.-Japan Seminar on Surface Characterization by Electron                     
              Diffraction, REM, and Holography, to be held March 15-18, 1993                 
              in Honolulu.  The co-organizers are Professor Philip I. Cohen,                 
              Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Minnesota,                 
              and Professor Ayahiko Ichimiya, Department of Applied Physics,                 
              Nagoya University.  The objective of this seminar is to bring                  
              together recent advances in electron probes of surface structures              
              important to the nucleation and growth of thin films.  The electron            
              probes to be emphasized have similar analyses, with many of the                
              participants involved in more than one aspect.  The participants are           
              from several fields, including electron microscopy, surface science,           
              and epitaxial growth.  This seminar should enhance significantly               
              the interactions between U.S. and Japanese scientists using new                
              electron probes of new materials, improve their understanding of               
              these probes, and develop the technology for the growth of these               
              new thin film materials.
