Abstract    :
              A database system for computer vision must be able to manipulate               
              data in numerous forms, running a full spectrum from values of                 
              scalar features, through arrays of light intensities, to complex               
              linked data structures representing networks of partially and                  
              tentatively recognized shapes and models. This work entails the                
              design and partial implementation of a prototype vision database               
              system based on a hierarchical, relational data structure that                 
              can handle a wide variety of types of data. The design also                    
              includes a novel visual user interface that allows the user to                 
              examine and comprehend the entities being processed. In this                   
              work, the organization and access functions for the database                   
              system are developed through a study of the kinds of structures                
              and operations used in two different vision application domains:               
              robotics and medicine. Both primitive access functions and some                
              higher-level vision operations are implemented in the prototype                
              system. The flexibility and efficiency of the system are                       
              evaluated for vision algorithms being developed in robot vision                
              and medical image processing research projects.  The result will               
              be a general scientific database system that can be accessed via               
              both graphical and application program interface and that will                 
              satisfy the needs of computer vision systems.
