Abstract    :
                   The development of precambrian shields includes the assembly              
              of fundamentally different blocks or terranes.  Wopmay Orogen, in              
              the Northwest Territories of Canada is a well-studied example of               
              juxtaposition of different terranes, with Archean crust now                    
              adjacent to juvenile 2.0-2.4 Ga crust.  This research will                     
              investigate the geologic and isotopic consequences of collisional              
              interaction between these terranes, thought to have occurred at                
              1.885 Ga.  The work will involve timing the deformation along                  
              Wopmay Fault Zone, and the sources and timing of magmatism along               
              this fundamental crustal lithospheric boundary, and will be                    
              accomplished in collaboration with workers at the Geological Survey            
              of Canada.
