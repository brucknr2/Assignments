Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A field experiment designed study the Deep Western Boundary                    
              Current (DWBC) near the Blake-Bahamas Ridge with an Absolute                   
              Velocity Profiler (AVP) will take place in July 1992. The                      
              main objectives of this work are to determine the                              
              characteristics and volume transport of the DWBC                               
              and how that current interacts with topography. Supporting                     
              measurements of dissolved oxygen, turbulent kinetic energy                     
              dissipation rates and nutrients will be conducted
