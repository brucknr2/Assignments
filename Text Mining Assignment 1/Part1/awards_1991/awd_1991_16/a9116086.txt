Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The April 22, 1991 earthquake in Costa Rica triggered                          
              widespread ground failures: soil liquefaction and spreading;                   
              foundation failure of bridge abutments due to soil                             
              liquefaction; and landslides.                                                  
                                                                                             
              Liquefaction-induced ground failures are poorly understood,                    
              and as a consequence, only crude criteria have been                            
              developed for predicting their occurrence, and the                             
              destructive capability of these events.  This recent                           
              earthquake in Costa Rica provides an unexpected                                
              opportunity to make detailed field observations and                            
              measurements,  resulting in a well-documented set of case                      
              histories.  Such case histories aid in understanding the                       
              ground failure process; they also provide benchmark events                     
              for verification of analytical and empirical predictive models.                
                                                                                             
              The principal objective of this research project is to make                    
              detailed topographic and ground displacement measurements                      
              at several liquefaction-induced ground-failure sites in Costa                  
              Rica.  The ground surface effects to be measured are                           
              features that will soon disappear.
