Abstract    :
              The University of Florida College of Engineering (COE) is                      
              supporting a Minority Engineering Doctorate Initiative (MEDI).                 
              Funds will be used to assist in supporting eight PhD candidates who            
              will have the option of pursuing studies in the engineering                    
              specialty of their choice.  Each student will receive an annual                
              stipend of $16,000 plus a research expense allowance of $5000.  The            
              COE will cover the costs associated with tuition and fees,                     
              additions to stipends, and other expense items not covered by the              
              grant.  A unique recruiting and retention program will: attract                
              qualified candidates, provide remedial opportunities, and guarantee            
              a high level of success in program completion.  The MEDI program               
              would supplement and operate in concert with current minority                  
              recruiting programs.  A major difference is that it provides for               
              a well-supported sharp focus on minority engineering doctoral                  
              recruitment and retention.
