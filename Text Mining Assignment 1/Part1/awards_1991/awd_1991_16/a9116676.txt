Abstract    :
              This is a proposal to purchase an image plate detector for x-ray               
              crystallography of proteins.  Image plate detectors are a new                  
              technology poised to revolutionize protein crystallography as                  
              electronic detectors did in the 1980s.  They combine the best                  
              features of both electronic detectors and photographic film.                   
              They have superior signal to noise ration at low count rates,                  
              which is essential for protein crystals.  They have linear                     
              response over a wide dynamic range.  Most importantly, they have               
              superior spatial resolution compared to electronic detectors and               
              can be manufactured in large format.  Experimentally, these                    
              advantages allow the image plate to be placed close to the                     
              crystal so that a large angle is subtended and many more                       
              reflections are recorded simultaneously.  The proteins being                   
              studied are molecules that function biologically as enzymes, DNA               
              repair enzymes, antibodies, antigen complexes, proteins,                       
              determinants of pathogens, photoactive receptors, electron                     
              transfer center, oxygen binding proteins, growth factor receptors              
              and receptor complexes, and folate cofactor enzymes involved in                
              purine biosynthesis.
