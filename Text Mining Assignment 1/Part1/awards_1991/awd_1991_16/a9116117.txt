Abstract    :
                   One of the principal objectives of this research is to                    
              determine how deformation across the North American-Pacific plate              
              boundary in northern California is accommodated.  This area is                 
              poorly covered by existing geodetic networks and has received                  
              relatively little attention.  For example, there are only three                
              VLBI sites north of San Francisco Bay.  Nearly ten years of VLBI               
              measurements show that more than 60 % of the expected North                    
              America-Pacific motion occurs between the Sierra Nevada (stations              
              Hat Creek and Quincy) and the Pacific coast (Pt. Reyes), but do not            
              determine how that motion is distributed.  Terrestrial geodetic                
              networks on the other hand, yield more spatial detail but do not               
              span the entire zone of deformation.  Northwest of San Francisco               
              Bay they account for only 20 mm/yr, or less than half of the                   
              expected relative plate motion.  Previous geodetic results suggest             
              that a large fraction of the strain occurs northeast of the san                
              Andreas fault.  The PI will determine the distribution of active               
              deformation from the pacific coast across the Sierra Nevada block              
              to the western margin of the Basin and Range.  A network surveyed              
              using GPS on a periodic basis and tied to established VLBI sites               
              in northern California.
