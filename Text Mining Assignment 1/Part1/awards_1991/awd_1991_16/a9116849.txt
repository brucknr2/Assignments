Abstract    :
              This research deals with the use of domain and application                     
              knowledge to merge and manage scientific multi-media data from                 
              multiple sources.  The primary goal of this research is to                     
              develop methodologies to integrate knowledge with bio-medical                  
              image databases and to provide approximate, summary and                        
              conceptual query answering via generalization, specialization,                 
              and association operations.  Further, logical indexing techniques              
              for retrieving images by semantic contents and the requirements                
              of the query language constructs for supporting such                           
              cooperativequery answering will be developed.  Such features are               
              important in aiding scientists to extract new scientific                       
              knowledge from the raw data.  These concepts will be validated in              
              a testbed linked with the bio-medical image databases.  The joint              
              research between the investigators from the Computer Science                   
              Department and Medical School will assure the prototype system                 
              and experiments used are of direct interest to biological and                  
              medicalapplications.  The new methodology enables access to the                
              vast storehouse of images by content and features rather than by               
              artificial keys, such as a person's ID.  Such capabilities                     
              enhance the image databases by characterizing the objects                      
              functions or dysfunctions and behavior which will lead to                      
              improved image analysis and diagnosis techniques.  The outcomes                
              of this research should be extensible to other image and multi-                
              media database applications and result in an experimental                      
              knowledge-based image database system that will be made available              
              to the research community.
