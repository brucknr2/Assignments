Abstract    :
              Four research topics will materially constrain the mineralogy,                 
              petrology and geochemistry of the mantle, including source regions             
              and repositories for large-ion-lithophile elements relevant to the             
              modeling of alkali and basaltic magmatism.  A focused analytical               
              and interpretive program will be undertaken on ultradeep                       
              peridotites, eclogites of ultradeep and shallower origins, regional            
              lithospheric metasomatism, and specific minerals (oxides, diamond,             
              graphite, and zircon).  Site selection in the Kaapvaal and West                
              Africa cratons is guided by a body of existing data, sufficient in             
              detail to assure new insights to, and greater definition of the                
              lithosphere, the asthenosphere, and the transition zone.  A basic              
              premise and working model will be that kimberlitic clan magmas,                
              melt metasomatism, and the transport of ultradeep diamonds and                 
              xenoliths is by plumes that originate at the core-mantle boundary.
