Abstract    :
                   The PI  plans to examine (1) involvement of natural                       
              hydrocarbons for the formation of H2O2 and HCHO in air and (2)                 
              liquid phase formation of H2O2 and organic acids in clouds.                    
              Specifically, he will conduct continuous measurements of                       
              formaldehyde and peroxides in the gas phase, in cloud water, and in            
              precipitation at Whiteface Mountain with concurrent measurements of            
              other key atmosheric trace gases, including O3, CO, NOy, SO2 and               
              selected hydrocarbons and trace elements.  The goal is to document             
              the chemistry of individual cloud events and to determine seasonal             
              and air mass specific differences in cloud water chemical                      
              composition.  Additionally, the PI plans a limited flight program              
              focussing on measuring horizontal and vertical profiles for H2O2 and           
              O3 under clearly defined meteorological conditions in clear and                
              cloudy air, including airborne cloud water collections.  He will               
              also add measurements of other photochemically important species               
              such as hydroperoxides and other low molecular carbonyl compounds              
              (aldehydes and ketones) as the initial research program matures.
