Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research has three principal focal areas connected with the               
              theme of dynamic stress application and high rate chemical                     
              reactions, as follows: (1) shock-induced chemical reactions (with              
              controlled recovery experiments, mechanistic modeling, and time-               
              resolved reaction-rate measurements) and synthesis of novel and                
              metastable materials; (2) dynamic compaction of powders to form                
              metal-, intermetallic-, and ceramic-matrix composites; controlled              
              shock-induced and post-shock thermally-induced reactions to tailor             
              and optimize matrix-reinforcement interface characteristics; (3)               
              combustion processing by self-propagating chemical reactions in                
              powder mixtures, followed by high energy rate densification and                
              reaction sintering.  The research is performed at New Mexico Tech.             
              (shock-induced chemical reactions and synthesis), Los Alamos                   
              (modeling), Sandia (shock-wave facilities, modeling), Cal. Inst. of            
              Tech. (shock-tailoring of interfacial reactions in composites), and            
              UC-San Diego (combustion synthesis, dynamic densification and post-            
              shock processing) .                                                            
              %%%                                                                            
              This is an excellent area of research, where the research has                  
              potentially high pay-off with the capability to produce new                    
              materials.  Modeling of the process variables is needed to permit              
              the scaling up of the process to larger sizes and more complex                 
              shapes.
