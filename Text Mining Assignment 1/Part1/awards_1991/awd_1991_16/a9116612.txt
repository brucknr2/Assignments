Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will support a two-year U.S.-Japan cooperative science              
              project between Professor Peter Barnes, Physics Department,                    
              Carnegie Mellon University, and Professor Fujio Takeutchi,                     
              Department of Physics, University of Kyoto Sangyo, Kyoto, Japan.               
              The U.S. group, which includes other investigators from Carnegie               
              Mellon University and the University of New Mexico, will travel                
              to Japan to develop and test equipment to be used in an experiment             
              at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL).  The experiment (E836)                
              has been approved by Brookhaven authorities to operate at the AGS              
              accelerator.  The experiment is a follow-on of one already                     
              performed to search for the bound state of six quarks, two of them             
              strange quarks.                                                                
                                                                                             
              The U.S. team will work on equipment performance tests at the                  
              National Laboratory of High Energy Physics (KEK), where beam                   
              time at the synchrotron is available, and will compare and check               
              data analysis performed independently by the U.S. and Japanese                 
              groups.  It is also planned to develop detectors at KEK for an                 
              experiment related to the search for double strange hypernuclei that           
              should exist if the H particle does not exist.  The Japanese group,            
              which includes investigators from Kyoto University and the Kyoto               
              University of Education, will travel to Brookhaven to take part in             
              the experiment.  They will install their equipment at the AGS/BNL              
              and take data.  A goal of this project is to develop and maintain a            
              cohesive effort and to develop future avenues of collaboration                 
              between U.S. and Japanese physicists.
