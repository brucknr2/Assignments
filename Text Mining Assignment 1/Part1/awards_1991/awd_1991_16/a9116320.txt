Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will support the participation of seven U.S. scientists in          
              a U.S.-Japan Seminar on Microfabrication and Biosensors, to be                 
              held July 21-24, 1992 in Anchorage, Alaska.  The co-organizers                 
              are Howard Weetall, Biotechnology Division, National Institute of              
              Standards and Technology (NIST), and Professor Isao Karube,                    
              Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology, University                
              of Tokyo.  The seminar participants represent a broad base of                  
              biosensor technologies presently under development in the United               
              States and Japan joining microfabrication technology and biology to            
              produce new and exciting biosensor technology.  Since the previous             
              meeting on this same subject held in 1989, major changes have                  
              occurred in the research area regarding new and important                      
              technological breakthroughs, as well as in the combination of                  
              electronics and biology.  In this seminar, participants will focus on          
              new research directions and areas for collaboration between U.S.               
              and Japanese scientists.
