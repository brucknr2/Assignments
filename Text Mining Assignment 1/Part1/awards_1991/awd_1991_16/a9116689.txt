Abstract    :
                   This research presents a novel approach to determine the                  
              relevant production ratio P21/P26 of the cosmic-ray-produced                   
              nuclides 21Ne and 26Al by isotopic measurements of Ne in quartz                
              samples of glacially polished rocks of the Sierra Nevada range.                
              The recently discovered cosmic-ray-produced radionuclides (10Be,               
              14C, 26Al, 36Cl) coupled with stable isotopes 3He, 21Ne, 22Ne and              
              production ratios in terrestrial surface materials open up a new               
              field of study which was not previously possible, e.g.                         
              determinations of erosion rates and geological processes (uplifts,             
              variations in ice cover).  Our feasibility study (Graf et al, 1991)            
              has shown that cosmic-ray-produced Ne signatures in quartz can be              
              recovered, and that determinations of the relative productions of              
              21Ne and 26Al (in both cases the target element is Si) will be                 
              required for the evaluation of complex exposure histories as are               
              typical in geological processes, such as variations in the                     
              Antarctic ice cover.
