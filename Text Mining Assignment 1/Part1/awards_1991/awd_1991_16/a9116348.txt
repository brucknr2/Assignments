Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This two-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research in               
              marine geology between Donald F. McNeill of the University of                  
              Miami and Djafar Aissaoui of the University of Paris (South).  The             
              objective of their research is to calibrate and refine the timing of           
              geodynamic events associated with an active, subducting plate                  
              boundary. The investigators will apply carbonate                               
              magnetostratigraphy to an uplifted atoll in the Loyalty Islands of             
              the South Pacific.  Dr. McNeill brings to this collaboration                   
              experience in rock magnetics and magnetostratigraphic dating of                
              shallow-water carbonates.  He has constructed a superconducting                
              magnetics laboratory for data analysis.  This is complemented by               
              Dr. Aissaoui's knowledge about the Atoll's geology and                         
              stratigraphy.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              Carbonate magnetostratigraphy is a novel technique for timing and              
              determining rates of motion at active plate boundaries and for                 
              extracting data on past sea level events.  Results from this research          
              will determine its feasibility for studies at active plate boundaries          
              and could lead to its widespread use for research in geodynamics               
              and plate tectonics.
