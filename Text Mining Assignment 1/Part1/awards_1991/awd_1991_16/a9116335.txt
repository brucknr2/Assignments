Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is to synthesize structurally                       
              intriguing molecules.  Particular emphasis will be placed on                   
              constructing systems wherein cyclobutane sigma orbitals can                    
              relay pi-electronic information from two sectors rigidly                       
              arranged in orthogonal fashion.  Other targets include                         
              biscyclooctatetraenophanes, beltenes and a semibullvalene                      
              having a neutral homoaromatic ground state.  Studies on the                    
              limits of neighboring group participation on classical first                   
              order substitution reactions will also be carried out as will                  
              research on the catalytic role of Group 4 transition metal                     
              complexes in asymmetric synthesis.

              With this accomplishment based renewal award, the Synthetic                    
              Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr. Leo A.                       
              Paquette of the Department of Chemistry at Ohio State                          
              University.  Dr. Paquette will focus his work on the synthesis                 
              of structurally intriguing polycyclic molecules whose                          
              electronic and reactivity characteristics test the limits of                   
              existing theoretical models.
