Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This study will attempt to determine the origin of nutrient-                   
              depleted glacial North Atlantic Intermediate Water (GNAIW) during              
              the last glacial maximum (LGM) and changes in the subpolar north               
              Atlantic vertical nutrient gradient over several climatic cycles.              
              A nutrient vs depth profile for LGM on Rockfall Plateau/Hatton                 
              Drift and Erik Ridge near the source of formation of intermediate              
              and deep waters will be constructed.  Carbon-isotopic ratios in                
              benthic foraminifera and Cd/Ca ratios will provide clues to the                
              origin of GNAIW.
