              This award from the U.S.-Argentina Cooperative Science                         
              Program supports U.S. participation in a U.S.-                                 
              Argentina Workshop on Metal-microbe Interactions:                              
              Corrosion and Fouling to be held in Mar del Plata,                             
              Argentina, October 19-23, 1992.  The organizers are                            
              Dr. William G. Characklis of Montana State University                          
              and Dr. Hector Videla the University of La Plata.

              immediate research needs necessary to solve the most                           
              pressing industrial problems related to the control of                         
              biofouling and biocorrosion.  The workshop brings                              
              together scientists with substantial expertise in                              
              terrestrial and marine biocorrosion and biofouling                             
              processes and industrial monitoring.  The                                      
              opportunities afforded by the workshop for both                                
              technology transfer and for establishment of future                            
              collaborative efforts are excellent.
