Abstract    :
              An invitational workshop is proposed on terrestrial and aquatic                
              ecosystems in the Dry Valleys of Antarctic.  The purpose of the                
              workshop is to bring together leading experts in Antarctic and                 
              comparable ecosystems in Arctic and Temperate regions to discuss               
              the scientific priorities for future research in the Dry Valleys.              
              A second major aspect of this workshop will be the consideration               
              of technological, logistical, operational, and environmental                   
              concerns associated with the conduct of this research. The                     
              motivation for holding this workshop is the increased scientific               
              interest and concern that the Antarctic Dry Valleys may be one of              
              the best barometers of climatic change.  The 3 day workshop will               
              be held at the New York Botanical Gardens' Institute of Ecosystem              
              Studies.  Several foreign scientists will included in the                      
              workshop. The organizing committee will model the workshop after               
              the very successful Dalhem conferences which allow participants                
              to provide input and discussion on each topic.  A report will be               
              published and distributed following the workshop.
