Abstract    :
              The Bigelow Laboratory for Oceanographic Sciences will                         
              acquire and operate a modern six-channel, continuous flow                      
              nutrient analyzer as a shared use facility.  These                             
              instruments provide rapid and accurate measurements of                         
              chemical constituents and nutrients in seawater samples.                       
              Such measurements are critical to many modern oceanographic                    
              and marine biological investigations.  The equipment will be                   
              used by a number of NSF-sponsored researchers associated with                  
              the 1992 and 1993 JGOFS field programs in the Pacific.                         
              Following the support of these programs, the instrument will                   
              be housed and maintained at Bigelow Laboratory for shared use                  
              by a variety of investigators there and in the region.  At                     
              Bigelow, it will benefit NSF-sponsored research projects by                    
              increasing the capabilities of the institution to support                      
              research and educational activities.
