Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This seminar on "New Aspects of Molecular Photochemistry in                    
              Photoconversion" is supported under the auspices of the U.S.-Japan             
              Cooperative Photoconversion/Photosynthesis Program.  It will be                
              held April 13-17, 1992 in Tsukuba, Japan.  The co-organizers are               
              Professor Richard A. Caldwell of the University of Texas at Dallas             
              and Professor Katsumi Tokumaru of the University of Tsukuba.                   
              The grant supports the participation of eleven scientists from the             
              United States, who will discuss new results and concepts in                    
              relevant theory, dynamic measurements, and molecular reactivity.               
              Specific topics to be discussed include:  (1) photo-induced bond               
              cleavages, (2) potential energy surfaces in photochemical                      
              reactions--experimental and theoretical approaches, (3) radical pair           
              and biradical/biradicaloid intermediates (singlets and triplets), (4)          
              theories of photochemical reactivity, and (5) photochemical electron           
              transfer processes and dynamic and molecular aspects.
