Abstract    :
              The principal investigator will explore a new and more unified                 
              method for including the solvent in Monte Carlo simulations of                 
              proteins.  Many of the specific techniques are borrowed from                   
              methods currently being used in statistical mechanics and quantum              
              field theory.  The computational portion of this work will                     
              involve simulations on a 32K processor Connection Machine which                
              has a massively parallel computer architecture.  This Small Grant              
              for Exploratory Research award reflects the transfer of knowledge              
              from physics to biology and the multidisciplinary nature of the                
              work, involving research expertise in physics, computation and                 
              biology.
