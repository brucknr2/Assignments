Abstract    :
              This award supports Prof. William D'Arcy from the                              
              Missouri Botanical Gardens in a research                                       
              collaboration with Prof. Carmen Benitez de Rojas of                            
              the Instituto de Botanica Agricola in Maracay,                                 
              Venezuela.  The purpose of the collaboration is to                             
              carry out joint research on the taxonomy and                                   
              classification of two large genera of the                                      
              Solanaceae, a major plant family that includes                                 
              petunias, tobacco, potatoes, tomatoes, and many                                
              other economic plants.                                                         
                                                                                             
              While this important family of plants is richest in                            
              the Andean region, no modern floristic treatment                               
              exists for northern South America.  The two                                    
              investigators have recently completed a floristic                              
              treatment of the southern half of Venezuela, and                               
              they intend to continue their efforts and produce a                            
              treatment for all of Venezuela. By bringing together                           
              these two researchers, this project will enhance the                           
              capabilities of the institutions involved in the                               
              project.  The Venezuelan side will benefit from the                            
              introduction of computer and other modern                                      
              methodologies; the U.S. side from access to the                                
              extremely rich and poorly known flora of Venezuela.
