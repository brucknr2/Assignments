Abstract    :
              This project involves developing and testing a hypermedia                      
              database based on the computer science literature.  Human-                     
              computer interaction and information storage and retrieval                     
              research are being applied to develop a new paradigm of user-                  
              centered database development and access. Local testing is being               
              done by faculty and students at VPI&SU, with additional testing                
              over the Internet.  Computer science literature provided by the                
              Association for Computing Machinery is being transformed to                    
              better serve the needs of a wide spectrum of computing                         
              practitioners. Based on interviews with computer professionals                 
              and analysis of existing publications, "objects" used in                       
              computing are being identified so that a tailored object-                      
              oriented database including algorithms, algorithm descriptions,                
              bibliographic records, full texts of articles, reviews, data,                  
              page images, and related multimedia can be stored and                          
              appropriately linked for searching and browsing.  New minimal                  
              perfect hashing and graph partitioning algorithms provide                      
              efficient access to the large, distributed graph of objects.  As               
              a result of this project, it will be easier to locate and                      
              manipulate information in the resulting electronic archive, which              
              will facilitate reading, writing, annotating, and sharing.                     
              Software and methodology used in this project will aid other                   
              fields as they develop sophisticated electronic archives with                  
              multimedia capabilities.
