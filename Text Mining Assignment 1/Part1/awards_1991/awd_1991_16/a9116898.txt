Abstract    :
                   Thrust fronts are located at the interface between thrust                 
              belts and foreland basins.  The unique array of structures found               
              in these zones (opposing vergencies and triangle zones) may be due             
              to normal propagation of the thrust belt towards the foreland or               
              they may be developed because the thrust belt could move no farther            
              towards the craton.  This project will examine subsurface and                  
              surface data from the Precordillera of western Argentina where a               
              thrust front is well exposed, and considerable seismic data is                 
              available for reprocessing.  Results will help resolve the origin              
              of thrust front structures and in understanding the mechanics of               
              thrust belts in general.
