Abstract    :
                This grant will fund urgently needed support through the SGER                
              program to cover the critical costs for field measurements of the              
              large (M=7.5) Costa Rica earthquake of April 22, 1991.  Prior to               
              the main shock, the principal investigator installed a portable                
              network of seismometers centered on the western coast of Costa                 
              Rica in anticipation of an earthquake there.  These portable                   
              instruments augmented the joint Costa Rica/UC Santa Cruz                       
              permanent seismometer net installed in 1984.  The April 22 event               
              occurred just outside of the net on the eastern coast but                      
              valuable strong motion data were obtained.  Additional portable                
              stations will be deployed to surround the aftershock region.                   
              This research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard                 
              Reduction Program.
