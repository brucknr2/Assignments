Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project offers a unique solution to the problems associated               
              with identifying, sorting and assessing the physiological status of            
              zooplankton.  Molecular techniques will be developed that can                  
              rapidly identify and quantify the level of expression of                       
              physiologically significant genes in the copepod, Calanus                      
              finmarchicus.  These techniques take advantage of the specificity              
              and sensitivity of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to                      
              quantitatively amplify species-specific mRNAs that encode enzymes              
              that regulate metabolic flux.  In order to design the necessary                
              primers for PCR, the cDNAs that encode for the enzymes, hexokinase,            
              phosphofructokinase, phosphoglucose isomerase and citrate                      
              synthetase will be cloned utilizing the phylogenetically conserved             
              primary sequences of these enzymes.  Species-specific primers will             
              be designed from these cDNA sequences and used to quantitatively               
              amplify each enzyme's mRNA only from C. finmarchicus to ascertain              
              the affect of environmental parameters on the level of enzyme                  
              expression.  Differences in the quantity of C. finmarchicus present            
              in a taxonomically complex assemblage of zooplankton will be                   
              normalized by simultaneously measuring the specific concentration              
              of a physiologically invariant gene, such as actin. The results                
              will be equivalent to enzyme per weight of C. finmarchicus, a unit             
              comparable to more traditional physiological studies.
