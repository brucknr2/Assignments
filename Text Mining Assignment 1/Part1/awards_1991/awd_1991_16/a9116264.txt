Abstract    :
                   This action is to support a workshop on computational                     
              neurobiology.  The workshop is to be held in San Francisco,                    
              California, July 23-24, 1991.  The sessions to be held at the                  
              workshop will focus on biological issues in neural networks.  Not              
              only will leaders in the field be presenting information relevant              
              to computational issues surrounding biological neural systems but              
              a pre-workshop, tutorial session is planned to allow hands-on                  
              experience for mathematicians and theorists as well as for                     
              experimentalists.  This workshop includes students and an                      
              informal atmosphere in which ideas can be discussed.
