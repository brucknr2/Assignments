Abstract    :
              The objective of this award is the isolation, identification, and              
              mapping of large segments of the Arabidopsis genome using yeast                
              artificial chromosome (YAC) vectors and the construction of new                
              Arabidopsis YAC libraries.  This research takes advantage of newly             
              developed pulse field gel sizing methods and yeast transformation              
              approaches to enrich for Arabidopsis YAC clones that contain larger            
              average inserts than are present in the existing libraries.  The               
              new, larger libraries should reduce the number of steps in a                   
              chromosome walking experiment by greater than a factor of two, thus            
              facilitating the identification of specific genes of interest.                 
                                                                                             
              The utility of the research lies in rapid distribution and                     
              dissemination of the library to the entire scientific community.               
              Drs. Chory and Hoekstra will establish methods for clone archiving             
              and data storage to catalog the library, and to place existing                 
              markers onto known clones in collaboration with the Howard                     
              Goodman's group at Massachusetts General Hospital.  Copies of the              
              YAC library will be distributed to interested researchers through              
              the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center at Ohio State                       
              University.
