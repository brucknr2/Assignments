Abstract    :
                   The Owens River at Long Valley follows the caldera's moat                 
              around the N and E sides of the resurgent dome and shows geomorphic            
              evidence that its course has been modified by uplift of the dome               
              over a period of time considerably longer than the last ten years.             
              In most of its lower 15km, the river consists of two parallel                  
              meander belts separated by a nearly planar interfluvial surface                
              (200-300m wide) that shows no trace of recent river activity.  The             
              two belts display essentially identical meander amplitude and                  
              wavelength, but are not the same age.  The older meander belt, now             
              carrying a small underfit stream, invariably lies closer to the                
              dome than the main flow in the new outboard channel, and sits some             
              30-60 cm higher in elevation.  The river apparently jumped into the            
              new channel after some period of lateral tilting.  Projection of               
              the interfluvial surface to the axis of the some suggests that                 
              total uplift of 15 to 35 meters may have occurred.  In the                     
              lowermost six km of its course, the Owens River floodplain shows               
              as many as six identifiable meander belts of different age (some               
              lying outboard and other lying well inboard of the modern channel)             
              that appear to record events of subsidence as well as resurgence.              
              Knowing the absolute ages of the river's occupancy of each of these            
              meander belts may provide us an estimate of the timing of the                  
              resurgence and subsidence of the dome.  We are particularly                    
              interested to know whether eruptive activity in the Mono Craters               
              and Inyo Craters north of the caldera has been tied in a temporal              
              way to the migratory behavior of the Owens River channel, and thus             
              possible to the resurgence and subsidence of the crate floor.
