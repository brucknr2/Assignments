Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The proposed three year investigation is a request for a                       
              continuation of an international exchange research program between             
              the University of Hawaii and the University of Lecca, Italy                    
              examining the comparative physiology of intestinal nutrient                    
              transport in fish of economic importance in both countries.  Hawaii            
              and Italy both have extensive fish aquacultural activities                     
              currently underway to help meet the burgeoning human need for                  
              protein.  A serious problem to fish economic development is the                
              production of an artificial diet that is nutritious and                        
              inexpensive.  The requested extension of this previously highly                
              successful research effort will use several in vitro laboratory                
              methods to elucidate the mechanisms of sugar, amino acid, peptide,             
              and short chain fatty acid transport in the intestines and                     
              associated diverticula from herbivorous and carnivorous fishes at              
              the two laboratories.  The novel information resulting from these              
              physiological studies may be important in the future development               
              of artificial diets for these respective fishes and may reduce the             
              time necessary for each species to reach their full aquaculture                
              potential.
