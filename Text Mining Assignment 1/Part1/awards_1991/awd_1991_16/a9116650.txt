Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Funds are provided for the continuation of the work on                         
              the valencia Trough - an extensional basin formed during                       
              oligo-Miocene.  The focus is on the pre-rift lithospheric                      
              structure and rheological layering.  A one-year wrap-up study                  
              using seismic, heat-flow, modeling and sediment data will                      
              be accomplished to decipher the structural evolution of                        
              the Trough.
