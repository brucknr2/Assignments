Abstract    :
              In a cooperative study with Colorado School Mines the effects of               
              implantation of very large concentrations of ions on friction and              
              wear properties will be evaluated.  The microstructure,                        
              microhardness, residual surface stresses and tribological behavior             
              of ferrous surfaces, which have been implanted with up to 20 atomic            
              percent of nitrogen, oxygen, boron and/or carbon, will be                      
              determined and correlated with processing variables.
