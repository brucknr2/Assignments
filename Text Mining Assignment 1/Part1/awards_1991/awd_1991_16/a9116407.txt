Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The purpose of this proposal is to provide a strategic                         
              planning "blueprint" for four to five of the EPSCoR                            
              states so that they may accomplish some short-term,                            
              midterm and long-term (nine year) planning for academic                        
              research and development in each individual state.  The                        
              effort is also to provide a common format to the planning                      
              process so that NSF can coalesce the plans and use them                        
              to develop a plan for NSF from the constituency up.  The                       
              time frame is one year and will require Dr. Ahmad setting                      
              up a small project task force to insure compatibility and                      
              uniformity.
