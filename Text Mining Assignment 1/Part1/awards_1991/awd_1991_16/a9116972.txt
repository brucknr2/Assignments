Abstract    :
                   This award provides two-thirds of the funding required for the            
              purchase of computer hardware and software that will be installed              
              and maintained in the Department of Marine, Earth and Atmospheric              
              Sciences at North Carolina State University. The University is                 
              committed to providing the remaining funding needed for this                   
              acquisition.                                                                   
                   The immediate research uses of the equipment and software will            
              be in connection with data reduction and analysis on the Principal             
              Investigator's research on crustal motion in the southwest Pacific             
              region using the Global Positioning System of satellites for                   
              precise geodetic measurements.
