Abstract    :
              In this project, the American Crystallographic Association will                
              develop a curriculum for and conduct a pilot experimental short                
              course in the determination of the crystal structures of small                 
              and medium-sized molecules. The course, intended for beginning                 
              crystallographers, will emphasize hands-on experience and will                 
              lead to an increase the reservoir of crystallographic expertise                
              available to the U.S. scientific community.  A set of lecture                  
              and laboratory notes will be produced and made available to                    
              chemistry and biology departments that wish to offer a similar                 
              introductory crystallography course.

              With this award, the Chemistry Division and the Division of                    
              Instrumentation & Resourses will support a Course for Novice                   
              Crystallographers proposed by Dr. Bryan M. Craven of the                       
              Department of Chemistry at the University of Pittsburgh. The                   
              course will be offered to beginning crystallographers by the                   
              American Crystallographic Association.  The notes produced from                
              the pilot experimental short course will be made available for                 
              wide dissemination to chemistry and biology departments.
