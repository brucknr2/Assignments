Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Using cores collected in the Cariaco Basin (Venezuela) in 1990,                
              proposed analyses will focus on interannual and millennial-scale               
              variability in upwelling, regional wind strength, and the                      
              hydrological balance in northern South America\ over the last 20-30            
              thousand years.  Of particular interest will be decadal records                
              over the Little Ice Age and the Younger Dryas Event.  Comparison of            
              varve and 14-C chronologies will provide the much-needed                       
              independent record of e\secular 14-C variations through the last               
              deglaciation.
