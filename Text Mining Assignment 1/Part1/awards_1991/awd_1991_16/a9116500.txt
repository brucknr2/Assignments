Abstract    :
              During the last few years, the Ocean Drilling Program has                      
              employed a sampling strategy in which bathymetric transects are                
              drilled on aseismic ridges in order to reconstruct the Cenozoic                
              history of carbonate production and dissolution, and deep water                
              chemistry and circulation. This strategy has evolved from similar              
              shallow coring programs examining late Quaternary oceanographic                
              history. Carbonate accumulation in the shallowest sites of the                 
              depth transect approximates carbonate productivity in the                      
              overlying waters. If the sites are close together and only vary                
              in depth, the accumulation rates will record carbonate                         
              dissolution which will be controlled by changes in bottom water                
              chemistry.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              The objective of the present project is to acquire seismic data                
              and core samples from the Ceara Rise in the western equatorial                 
              Atlantic. The Ceara Rise is capped by a thick section of Cenozoic              
              sediments and should be an ideal site for a depth transect study.              
              Additionally, the data to be acquired will form the basis for a                
              detailed ODP drilling program which has been proposed for this                 
              area.
