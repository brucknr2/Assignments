Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              It is proposed to integrate satellite imagery of sea surface                   
              temperature and reflectance (turbidity) with a mixed layer model               
              and a three-dimensional circulation model to infer dynamical                   
              processes of the subtidal circulation in Delaware Bay. Then, the               
              output of the three-dimensional model will be validated against in-            
              situ data.
