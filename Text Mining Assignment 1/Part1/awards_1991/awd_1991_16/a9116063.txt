Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will support a two-year U.S.-Japan cooperative science              
              project between Professor William Oliver, Department of                        
              Electrical, Computer, and Systems Engineering and Center for                   
              Space Physics, Boston University, and Professor Shoichiro Fukao,               
              Radio Atmospheric Science Center, Kyoto University.  The project               
              involves study of large-scale dynamical systems in the upper-                  
              atmosphere and ionosphere with MU (Middle and Upper                            
              atmosphere) radar at Shigaraki and the chain of ionosondes located             
              at Japanese longitudes.  The study will attempt to verify the                  
              existence of and distinguish between three different circulation               
              systems indicated to exist by theory:  the "normal" circulation                
              system driven by solar photon heating at the sub-solar point and the           
              "disturbance" circulation systems driven from the auroral and                  
              equatorial regions during periods of solar-wind disturbance of the             
              earth's magnetic environment.                                                  
                                                                                             
              During the summer of 1992 the investigators will attempt to verify             
              the existence of these systems, identify their boundaries, and                 
              observe their latitudinal expansions and contractions during                   
              disturbance periods.  During the summer of 1993 they will attempt              
              to relate the ionospheric drift directions and gradients established           
              by these circulations to theories of plasma instability generation to          
              see if these conditions can provide seeding for the generation of the          
              remarkable irregularities discovered by the MU radar in the                    
              ionosphere.
