Abstract    :
              The goals of the proposal research are to (1)                                  
              develop key technologies in two critical areas                                 
              of nanofabrication: ultra-high resolution                                      
              electron beam lithography and reactive ion                                     
              etching; (2) use the existing nanofabrication                                  
              technologies (sub-30 nm) developed in the PI's                                 
              group to fabricate various innovative high-                                    
              speed nanoscale devices, such as lateral                                       
              resonant tunneling transistors, quantum                                        
              waveguide transistors, and single electron                                     
              transistors; and (3) use these devices as                                      
              research vehicles to study ballistic, quantum                                  
              transport, and Coulomb blockade in                                             
              nanometer devices, develop new device                                          
              concepts, and explore new device functions                                     
              and revolutionary IC architectures.
