Abstract    :
                   If a linear theory of gravitation were correct, then                      
              colliding plane gravitational waves in a vacuum would pass                     
              through one another without any alterations in their shapes or                 
              intensities.  However, according to the nonlinear theory of                    
              gravitation due to Einstein, two colliding plane gravitational                 
              waves in a vacuum interact and thereby produce a scattered wave                
              which is not a plane wave and which differs markedly from the                  
              original plane waves.  The principal objective of this research                
              is to find systematic methods of determining the scattered wave                
              when the two colliding plane waves are given, i.e., methods of                 
              solving the initial value problem for colliding plane                          
              gravitational waves.  A related objective is to seek the answers               
              to certain important questions concerning such collisions.  One                
              of these questions is whether the study of colliding plane                     
              gravitational waves can tell us anything significant about real                
              colliding gravitational waves (which are not planar).                          
                   The research, which begins with a reformulation of the                    
              initial value problem into a certain new kind of Riemann-Hilbert               
              problem, involves the analysis of this Riemann-Hilbert problem,                
              the study of the existence and properties of its solutions, and                
              the discovery of practical methods of solving the problem.
