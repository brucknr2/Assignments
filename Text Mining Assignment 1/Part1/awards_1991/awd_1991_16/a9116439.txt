Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This US-Czechoslovakia research project in wetland plant                       
              ecology and water resources management is between Dr.                          
              Michael S. Adams of the University of Wisconsin-Madison;                       
              Dr. Jan Kvet of the Botanical Institute, Czechoslovak                          
              Academy of Sciences at Trebon, Czechoslovakia; and Dr.                         
              Tadeusz Traczyk of the Institute of Ecology, Polish                            
              Academy of Sciences, Mikolajke, Poland.  Research at these                     
              two sites will focus on the ecology of the wetland plant                       
              Lythrum salicaria, and will illuminate what factors allow                      
              Lythrum to be a successful invader of North American                           
              wetlands while remaining an early successional species in                      
              Europe.  At Trebon, other efforts will address                                 
              bioindication for potential contribution to formulation of                     
              new management practices that could better protect                             
              Czechoslovakia's water resources.                                              
                                                                                             
              This project in biotic systems fulfills the program                            
              objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling                        
              leading experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to                     
              combine complementary talents and pool resources in areas                      
              of strong mutual interest and competence.
