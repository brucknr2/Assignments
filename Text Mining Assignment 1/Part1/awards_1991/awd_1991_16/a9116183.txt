Abstract    :
                 Unlike traditional data networks, future broadband-ISDN (BISDN)             
              wide- area networks will be required to carry a broad range of                 
              traffic classes ranging from bursty, variable-rate sources, such as            
              voice and variable- rate coded video, to smooth, constant bit rate             
              sources.  Moreover, these networks will have to do so while                    
              providing a guaranteed performance or quality-of-service (QOS) to              
              these traffic classes.  The problem of characterizing performance in           
              such networks is thus particularly important since this must be done           
              not only for traditional off-line tasks of dimensioning and design             
              (e.g., determining link bandwidths, buffer capacities and processing           
              capacities at network switchpoints) but also for on-line,                      
              performance-driven traffic control purposes such as session- level             
              admission control.  In this proposal the principal investigators               
              outline research aimed at providing the analytical tools and                   
              techniques for analyzing such networks and their diverse workloads             
              and for designing and characterizing the properties of scheduling              
              policies in these networks. The principal investigators propose to:            
              1.develop techniques to upper bound a variety of per-session                   
              performance measures such as probability of buffer overflow and the            
              distribution of packet delay and to do so in a network environment             
              in which sessions may traverse several hops,    2.develop                      
              approximation techniques for estimating the probability of buffer              
              overflows in a network handling diverse classes of (potentially                
              bursty) traffic sources, and    3.develop a sample path based on               
              methodology for characterizing optimal scheduling policies.
