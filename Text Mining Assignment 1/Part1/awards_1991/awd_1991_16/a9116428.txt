Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project involves the dissertation research of a student in                
              cultural anthropology in a rural area of Cameroon.  The research               
              will investigate how people's perceptions of illnesses and                     
              treatment alternatives, and their evaluations of treatment                     
              results, influence their health-seeking behavior.  Most studies                
              of health-seeking behavior examine how isolated beliefs correlate              
              with treatment behavior; in contrast this project analyzes the                 
              medical decision-making process.  The project will examine social              
              networks and group consensus using ethnography, formal and                     
              informal interviews, and relatively new analytical procedures in               
              cognitive anthropology to study how group agreement on                         
              categorizations and evaluations influence behavior.                            
                                                                                             
              This research is important because lay people in all societies                 
              have divergent "popular models" of illness and treatment, which                
              sometimes support but often conflict with scientifically-derived               
              treatment regimes.  Understanding the importance of cultural                   
              factors in medical decision making in this one case will advance               
              our theoretical knowledge about compliance and health seeking                  
              behavior in general.
