Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This three-year award supports cooperative research involving Paul             
              A. Heiney, of the University of Pennsylvania and Roger Moret and               
              Patrick Bernier of the University of Paris (South), Orsay.  They               
              will determine the long and short-range structural ordering in                 
              fullerites and their alkali metal intercalation compounds.                     
              Intramolecular bonding and molecular orientational order will be               
              probed by x-ray diffraction techniques.  These studies will be                 
              complemented by NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) experiments                   
              to determine the short-range interatomic, intermolecular and atomic            
              molecular interactions in doped phases.                                        
                                                                                             
              Fullerites are a new class of materials with superconducting                   
              capabilities.  The principal objective of this study is to identify the        
              origin of their metallic and superconducting behavior and to                   
              determine their properties.  A mixture of X-ray diffraction and                
              NMR techniques will provide complementary information and data.                
              Dr. Heiney brings to this collaboration experience in fullerite                
              synthesis.  This is complemented by French expertise for                       
              combining high pressure and low temperature x-ray diffraction,                 
              which will be crucial for determining the structure of fullerites.             
              The project will also benefit from access to the synchrotron                   
              radiation facility at Orsay.
