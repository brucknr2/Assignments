Abstract    :
              In this project, the PI will collect and measure the tracers                   
              tritium and helium isotopes, and collect samples to be analyzed                
              for Carbon-14, on a hydrographic line, south of 45 degrees South,              
              in the Pacific, as part of the World Ocean Circulation Experiment              
              (WOCE).  Data from this line, designated as WOCE line P-17S, will              
              be combined with other WOCE data to study the deep and bottom                  
              water formation and circulation in the Pacific sector of the                   
              Southern Ocean.
