Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              It is proposed to fabricate thin films of heavy-fermion materials              
              and study their transport properties when subjected to strong                  
              magnetic fields; compounds of cerium and of uranium will be                    
              examined.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              Heavy-fermion materials show extraordinary electronic properties,              
              some exhibit superconductivity.  Measurements on thin films should             
              give valuable insights into the behavior of these highly unusual               
              materials.
