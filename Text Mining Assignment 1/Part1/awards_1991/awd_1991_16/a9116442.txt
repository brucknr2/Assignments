Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award funds two of the nations leading infrared observers in              
              a study of the activity in the nuclei of active galaxies - both                
              those undergoing bursts of rapid star formation and those which                
              exhibit non-thermal emission presumably associated with a                      
              collapsed central object.  These investigators have developed new              
              infrared instrumentation which will permit more sensitive probes               
              of the central regions of these systems.
