Abstract    :
              Smith         In the area of cache memories and CPU performance  architecture
              the research efforts are directed at three items:  1.     A study of the
              behavior of vector workloads and the extent  to which vector machines can be
              expected to benefit from the use  of cache memories.  Iinitial results suggest
              that cache memories  would work well.  2.     A study of cache consistency in
              multiprocessors.  Current  research is directed at analyzing some
              multiprocessor traces in  order to understand sharing behavior, and to evaluate
              the  relative performance of a number of multiprocessor cache  consistency
              algorithms.  The project is generating  further  traces and study the effect of
              changes in the source code on  sharing behavior.  3.     The mMeasurement of
              the memory systems of a number of  machines to determine the effect that those
              memory systems have  on overall system performance.
