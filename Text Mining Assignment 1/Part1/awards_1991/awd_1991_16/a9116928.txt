Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                  This project involves geothermal research with two holes that             
              will be drilled in Moat-fill units in the Creede Mining District               
              in Colorado in the fall of 1991.  The objectives of the research               
              are to obtain excellent temperature-depth data, reliable heat flow             
              values (Q), uranium (U), thorium (Th) and potassium (K)                        
              concentration data, and radiogenic heat production data (A) for                
              both locales.  From the temperature-depth data, hydrologic                     
              phenomena in the environs of the holes can be studied, as may be               
              the fracture systems that are receiving and yielding subsurface                
              fluids.  The vertical distributions of U, Th, K and radiogenic heat            
              production also will be used to infer present and past movement of             
              fluids and radioisotopes in the Moat-fill units, and will provide              
              insight into relations between radioactive heat and hydrothermal               
              activity near both stations.  Considered with Q and A data that                
              exist for mining company holes in the District to the north, the               
              heat flow and heat production values for the holes in the Moat will            
              yield reliable estimates for heat sources and temperatures at                  
              depths greater than 1 km in the Creede Hydrothermal System,                    
              information that must be known for future deep drilling in this                
              classic mining area.
