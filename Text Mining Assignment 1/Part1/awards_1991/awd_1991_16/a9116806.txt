Abstract    :
              Penn State's "Graduate Engineering Education Fellowship for Women,             
              Minorities, and Persons with Disabilities" (GEE) program aims to               
              educate new engineering PhDs and prepare them for academic careers.            
              This program has the unique feature of a phased recruitment leading            
              to a university/industry/government partnership and a steady state             
              program after NSF support ends.  Fellows will receive a financial              
              support package and enroll in PhD programs in the College of                   
              Engineering or the College of Earth and Mineral Sciences.  In                  
              addition to taking courses, preparing for candidacy exams, and                 
              writing dissertations, fellows will participate in an organized                
              development program that includes research, teaching, mentoring,               
              networking, professional development, and professional society                 
              activities.  Dissertation research will take place in departmental             
              programs and laboratories, interdisciplinary centers, or                       
              intercollege programs.  Throughout the program the progress of the             
              fellows will be studied and evaluated.  A variety of institutional             
              and non-NSF support will be provided for the fellows.
