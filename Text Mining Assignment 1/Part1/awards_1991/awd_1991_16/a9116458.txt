Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The objectives of this project are improvement of CCD fabrication              
              technology to make high quality, large CCDs more widely available              
              to the University of California Observatories (UCO) and to the                 
              general astronomical community; improvement of UCO's capabilities              
              to develop and use large CCDs and mosaics of large CCDs, and;                  
              training in instrumentation and detector technology for students               
              at both the graduate student and post-doctoral level.                          
                                                                                             
              CCD imaging sensors would be fabricated by Loral/Fairchild and                 
              detailed testing and characterization would be carried out in the              
              new Lick Observatory Detector Development Laboratory.  The                     
              principal investigators would develop procedures for enhancing the             
              detector efficiency and would investigate methods for applying                 
              anti-reflection coatings to CCDs.                                              
                                                                                             
              Some of the CCDs fabricated under this proposal would be made                  
              available through the National Science Foundation to the general               
              astronomical community.
