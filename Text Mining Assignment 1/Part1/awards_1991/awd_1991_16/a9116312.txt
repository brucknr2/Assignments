Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Description: This project provides for field research by Dr. Fred              
              Rickson of Oregon State University and Prof. C.V.S. Gunatilleke                
              of the University of Paradeniya in Sri Lanka.  The work will                   
              comprise anatomical/morphological, cladistic, and molecular                    
              (cpDNA) investigation of Humboldtia laurifolia and its resident                
              ants, in Sri Lanka.  The study will analyze the evolutionary                   
              tightness between the ants and the plant, and will quantify any                
              protectionist function provided by the ants.  These data will be               
              used in a comparative biogeographic analysis with various                      
              Leonardoxa taxa from Cameroon, west Africa and Saraca                          
              thaipingensis from West Malaysia, in an attempt to further                     
              substantiate a Tertiary flora migration from the Malaysia region               
              to Africa with a side branch into southern India and sri Lanka.                
                                                                                             
              Scope:  This project will involve scientists from the U.S. and                 
              Sri Lanka, as well as graduate students from the host country.                 
              The field work will be done while Dr. Rickson is in Sri Lanka on               
              a ten month Fullbright fellowship.  The project meets the                      
              objectives of the Science in Developing Countries program.
