Abstract    :
              The objective of the proposal is to study the regulation of the                
              hbp gene in Escherichia coli.  The hbp gene product is very                    
              similar in amino sequence to a hemoglobin-like protein from a                  
              Vitreoscilla sp. and like the Vitreoscilla protein is regulated                
              in response to environmental oxygen concentration.  The specific               
              aims of the proposal are:  1. Physiological characterization of                
              hbp gene regulation in wild-type and mutant strains.  2. Genetic               
              characterization of hbp gene expression.  3. Identify and                      
              characterize the sequence required for hbp regulation from the                 
              hbp promoter.  The information obtained from this research will                
              contribute to the present knowledge on gene expression in                      
              response to environmental factors, and will also contribute to                 
              the overall understanding of gene regulation.
