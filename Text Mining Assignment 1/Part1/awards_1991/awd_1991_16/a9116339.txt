Abstract    :
              Dynamic compaction of collapsible soils under controlled soil                  
              moisture conditioning will be performed in laboratory and in the               
              field.  The objective is to determine the optimum moisture                     
              content based on depth and degree of improvement, and on degree                
              of vibration attenuation.  The improvement will be evaluated                   
              using surface elevation change, density increase based on                      
              undistributed samples, strength increase based on cone                         
              penetrometer soundings, and stiffness increases based on                       
              pressuremeter testing.  Efforts will be made to evaluate                       
              laboratory techniques for predicting optimum moisture content for              
              field compaction.  Test will include proctor moisture density                  
              tests at various energy levels as well as compaction test on                   
              undisturbed block samples trimmed into compaction molds.                       
                                                                                             
              Validation of the optimum moisture concept for dynamic compaction              
              of collapsible soils will result in increased compaction                       
              efficiency and soil improvement, shorter construction times, and               
              reduced costs.
