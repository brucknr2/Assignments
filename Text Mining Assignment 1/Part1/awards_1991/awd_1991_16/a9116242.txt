Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will support a two-year U.S.-Japan cooperative science              
              research project between Professor George Thomas, Division of                  
              Cell Biology and Biophysics, University of Missouri, and Professor             
              Issei Harada, Pharmaceutical Institute, Tohoku University, Sendai,             
              Japan.  This project will attempt to determine vibrational models              
              for a variety of DNA oligomers for assessing putative structural               
              markers.  Professor Harada will perform the UV resonance Raman                 
              measurements and normal coordinate analyses, while Professor                   
              Thomas will acquire the Raman and infrared data.                               
                                                                                             
              The objective of the research is to determine the nature of DNA                
              normal modes of vibration that generate conformation-sensitive                 
              Raman and infrared bands ("conformation markers").  The bands                  
              are important for diagnosing nucleic acid secondary structure in               
              biological assemblies.  They will be rigorously assigned using a               
              combination of experimental and theoretical methods.  The                      
              experimental data will be used to design a force field that                    
              accurately reproduces the observed frequencies, permitting the                 
              character of each normal mode to be ascertained (U.S. and Japan).              
              This approach, which represents the combined application of                    
              normal mode analysis and isotope substitution, should elucidate the            
              vibrational character of DNA conformation markers and provide                  
              for the first time a rigorous and quantitative basis for empirical             
              DNA spectra-structure correlations.
