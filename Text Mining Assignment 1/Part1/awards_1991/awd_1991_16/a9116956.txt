Abstract    :
                   The problem of fluid flow within the Earth's core, and its                
              resulting dynamo-generating capability, will be investigated from              
              a new point of view, relying on a specific model of the fully                  
              developed flow in the core driven by compositionally buoyant fluid             
              released at the base of the outer core as the iron-rich inner core             
              continues to solidify.  In this model compositionally buoyant                  
              plumes emanate from 'chimneys' piercing the partially molten outer             
              layer of the inner core.  The research will study the nature of                
              flow driven by these small-scale compositionally buoyant plumes and            
              blobs in a rotating, electrically conducting fluid, and the role               
              this flow may have in the generation of the Earth's magnetic field.
