Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will support the participation of eight U.S. scientists in          
              a U.S.-Japan Seminar on Parallel Symbolic Computing:                           
              Languages, Systems, and Applications, to be held in Cambridge,                 
              Massachusetts October 13-16, 1992.  The co-organizers are                      
              Professor Anant Agarwal of the MIT Laboratory for Computer                     
              Science and Robert Halstead of Digital Equipment Corporation,                  
              and Professor Takayasu Ito, Department of Information                          
              Engineering, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan.  The objectives of              
              the seminar are to bring U.S. and Japanese researchers together to             
              discuss important common theoretical and implementation                        
              problems, application areas for parallel symbolic computing, how               
              to move parallelism into wider use for symbolic computing, and                 
              opportunities for research collaboration.                                      
                                                                                             
              Parallel and distributed computing are becoming increasingly                   
              important as cost-effective ways to achieve high computational                 
              performance.  Symbolic computing is widespread in applications                 
              and hence parallel symbolic computing is important, but symbolic               
              computations are notable for their use of irregular data structures            
              (such as trees, lists, and graphs) and irregular, data-driven                  
              operations on them.  As a result, parallel symbolic computing has              
              its own distinctive set of technical challenges.  The seminar will be          
              valuable in making researchers in the United States and Japan more             
              aware of progress in the other country as well as helping them                 
              learn more about research in their own countries.
