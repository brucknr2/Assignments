Abstract    :
                   This grant partially supports the administration of the                   
              competition to determine the winner of the Loebner Prize.                      
              The Loebner Prize is an award established to recognize the                     
              first computer system that can pass the Turing Test of                         
              machine intelligence.  "This test requires a computer to                       
              emulate human behavior so well that it is impossible for                       
              human judges to distinguish the response of the computer                       
              system from responses of a person."
