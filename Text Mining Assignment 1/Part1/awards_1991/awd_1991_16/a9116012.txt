Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  A GLORIA hydrosweep, dredging and routine geophysical survey              
              of the western half of the Easter Seamount Chain will be made to               
              determine the physical and chemical character and gross relative               
              ages of volcanism that will therefore place important constraints              
              on its physical nature, origin and significance. All hypotheses                
              proposed to explain the origin of this seamount can be tested with             
              the data proposed for this study. In addition, the data will fill              
              help determine how the microplate originated.
