Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research in             
              mesoscale meteorology between Dale Durran of the University of                 
              Washington and Evelyne Richard and Phillipe Bougeault of the                   
              University Paul Sabatier in Toulouse, France.   The U.S. and                   
              French investigators have developed predictive models for air-flow             
              over mountains.  Although it has been recognized that mountains                
              exert a significant influence on atmospheric circulations, existing            
              forecast models and global climate models contain deficiencies in              
              representing the effects of mountain geography on air circulation.             
              The specific objective of their cooperation is to increase                     
              understanding of the interaction between mountains and synoptic-               
              scale air circulation, with particular emphasis on gravity-wave                
              drag.  In order to achieve this goal, the investigators need to better         
              understand the limitations of the current models and improve their             
              flexibility.                                                                   
                                                                                             
              Dr. Durran's nonhydrostatic model successfully simulates mountain              
              waves in a variety of regional environments, but has not been used             
              to simulate the interaction between gravity waves and larger scale             
              air flow.  The French investigators bring to this collaboration their          
              hydrostatic models for larger scale air flow.  Both models will be             
              to simulate real and idealized cross mountain flows.  Their                    
              investigations will be aided by unique observational data recently             
              collected in the Pyrenees region.  These complementary efforts will            
              result in models which are better able to predict the effect of                
              gravity-wave drag and in turn, weather forecasting in mountainous              
              regions.
