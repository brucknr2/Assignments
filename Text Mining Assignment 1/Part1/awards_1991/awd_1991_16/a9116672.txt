Abstract    :
                   To develop new methods beyond the classical method of group-              
              invariant solutions for finding explicit solutions to systems of               
              partial differential equations, and apply them to physically                   
              important systems and boundary value problems.  The methods to be              
              investigated will include non-classical symmetries, partially                  
              invariant solutions, partial symmetries, the Clarkson-Kruskal                  
              direct method, and weak symmetry groups.  These methods can all                
              be subsumed through the general theory of "side conditions" and                
              overdetermined systems of partial differential equations.  The                 
              emphasis of this project will be on the determination of new                   
              exact solutions to physically important boundary value, Cauchy                 
              and mixed problems for partial differential equations.
