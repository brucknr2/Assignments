Abstract    :
                   A group of researchers centered at the University of                      
              Maryland will be involved in mathematical and physical research                
              on chaotic dynamical systems, including in particular                          
              foundational questions of attractor reconstruction through                     
              embedding methods, and the recovery of the dynamics through the                
              embedding method, which is critical to making the approach useful              
              for experimental data.  Other areas to be investigated are                     
              chaotic transients  and the rigorous verification of computer-                 
              generated trajectories of nonlinear processes.  The focus will be              
              on development of computer algorithms for the analysis of data                 
              from experiments.                                                              
                   The study of chaos and chaotic behavior has attracted                     
              attention over the past decade, and there are substantial                      
              opportunities for exciting interactions between theoreticians and              
              experimentalists, so that new theoretical understanding can be                 
              transferred to the laboratory.
