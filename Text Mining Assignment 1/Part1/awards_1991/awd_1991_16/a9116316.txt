Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                     Laboratory experiments show that the U/Ca ratios in                    
              foraminifera tests are proportional to the ratios in sea water.                
              Thus, based on the analysis of form tests, the ocean has                       
              increased by about 20 percent and V decreased by a factor of 2                 
              since the peak of the last glacial period. Three approaches are                
              offered to test the hypothesis that these changes are related to               
              variation in the rates of exchange at the sediment.water                       
              interface through the oxidation condition of bottom waters: 1)                 
              test the mechanism of the incorporation of U and V into form                   
              tests; 2) investigate V speciation in seawater; 3) look at the                 
              changes in an Atlantic core over the past 250 thousand years as                
              well as long.term changes of U from the mid.Miocene.
