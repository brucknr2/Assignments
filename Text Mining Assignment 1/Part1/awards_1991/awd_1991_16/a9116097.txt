Abstract    :
                   An existing course in scientific computer interfacing                     
              will be updated to utilize modern hardware and software, and                   
              will be expanded to include students from several scientific                   
              disciplines.  The course will cover the basic principles of                    
              computer interfacing and data acquisition, the physics of                      
              transducers, and signal processing, culminating in a project                   
              designed and constructed by each student.                                      
                   Five state-of-the art interfacing workstations designed                   
              around the VME bus, and a logic analyzer to facilitate                         
              hardware debugging will be acquired, as well as two                            
              software/hardware packages which will be used as examples of a                 
              commercial data acquisition system.                                            
                   These workstations will be the foundation of the project-                 
              oriented course.  Students will use them every week to perform                 
              experiments in basic computer interfacing, the design and                      
              construction of ADC and DAC converters, signal processing                      
              techniques, optical and mechanical sensors and motors, high-                   
              speed data acquisition and nuclear counting techniques.
