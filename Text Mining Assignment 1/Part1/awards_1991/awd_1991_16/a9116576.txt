Abstract    :
              The investigation of a new approach to the synthesis of highly                 
              substituted dihydrobenzofurans, dihydroindoles,                                
              bicyclo{3.2.1}octenones and cyclobutanes will be made utilizing                
              novel regio- and stereoselective Lewis acid catalyzed formal                   
              cycloaddition reactions of alkenes and alkynes with                            
              1,4-benzoquinones, 1,4-benzoquinonediimides and alkoxy-alpha,                  
              beta-unsaturated enones.  The exploration and development of                   
              enantiospecific variants of these new methods utilizing chiral                 
              Ti(IV) catalysts is planned and many provide the products in                   
              high enantiomeric purity.  The structures of the products form                 
              all, or part of, the basic framework of many classes of                        
              biologically active molecules and chiral cyclobutanes may also                 
              be useful in the preparation of novel rod shaped polymers with                 
              interesting properties  Specific targets include kadsurenone, a                
              specific platelet-activating factor receptor antagonist,                       
              recaglamide, an antileukemic agent, viniferin, an antifungal                   
              agent, guianin, a representative neolignan, and acanthodoral, a                
              structurally interesting natural product.  In addition,                        
              syntheses of several 2-and 3-aryl-2,3-dihydrobenzofurans and                   
              their nitrogen analogs, i.e. 2-and 3-aryl-2,3-dihydroindoles,                  
              are planned.                                                                   
              %%%                                                                            
              With this award, the Organic Synthesis Program will support the                
              research of Dr. Thomas A. Engler at the University of Kansas.                  
              The studies will explore new routes to asymmetric molecules                    
              based on new methods utililzing chiral Ti(IV) based reagents.                  
              The new synthetic methodology should benefit research in                       
              biochemistry and medicine, as well as in the chemical industry.
