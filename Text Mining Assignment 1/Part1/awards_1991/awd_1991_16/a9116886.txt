Abstract    :
              In this project, the PI's will use the global XBT data set over                
              the 10-year period, 1979-1988 to map the thermal structure over                
              the globe and study seasonal and interannual variability.  Of                  
              particular interest are the sea surface temperature and vertically             
              averaged temperature over the upper 400 meters, the latter                     
              addressing variability of heat content and steric sea level.  An               
              expected result is the identification of global teleconnections in             
              the interannual variability of both sea surface temperature and                
              vertically averaged temperature associated with El Nino and                    
              Southern Oscillation.  Cross correlation with seasonal atmospheric             
              pressure fields will allow the study of coupled modes of global                
              variability.
