Abstract    :
              The proposed research is intended to exploit                                   
              opportunities recognized in the development of the                             
              LIGA process for fabrication of                                                
              microelectromechanical systems (MEMS).                                         
              Direction is provided by potential commercial                                  
              technology transfer, including improved MEMS for                               
              sensors and the creation of new classes of devices.                            
              A significant portion of the proposed research is in                           
              magnetics technology for MEMS.  Design methods                                 
              and constraints will be analyzed via electroplated                             
              magnetic structures.  A cell designed linear                                   
              magnetic actuator will be the primary test vehicle.                            
              The emphasis will involve output force per unit chip                           
              area considerations, speed and positional accuracy,                            
              as well as control electronics.  Rotating magnetic                             
              motors will be constructed with compatible gear                                
              boxes.  New microsensors such as magnetic                                      
              proximity sensors will also be investigated.
