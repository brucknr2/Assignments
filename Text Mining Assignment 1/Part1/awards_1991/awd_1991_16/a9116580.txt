Abstract    :
              The workshop to be held in Paris May 1992 will deal                            
              specifically with ground improvement technology. The topics                    
              envisioned for discussion are  physical-chemical                               
              modification; novel grouting methods; use of geosynthetics;                    
              ground improvement techniques for liquefaction control,                        
              hazard mitigation and slope stability; in situ testing and                     
              non destructive evaluation of improved ground; and                             
              numerical modeling of the engineering behavior of                              
              stabilized/improved systems. The invited group of                              
              participants will include members from the academic                            
              community, federal agencies, consulting firms, and                             
              contractors.
