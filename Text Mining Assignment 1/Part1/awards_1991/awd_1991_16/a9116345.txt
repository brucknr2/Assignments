Abstract    :
              This award provides modest funding for the continuation of the                 
              series of midwestern regional conferences focusing on                          
              developments in the theory of partial differential equations.                  
              The meetings, which began in 1977, are held at various                         
              institutions, growing in size from 60 faculty and graduate                     
              students to over 100 in 1990.  The conferences last two days,                  
              featuring two distinguished speakers from outside the area with                
              approximately six other talks interspersed.  The recommendation                
              to renew support is based first on the exceptional strength of                 
              U.S. research in partial differential equations concentrated in                
              the midwest as well as on the opportunity the meetings provide to              
              young investigators in developing experience and acquaintances in              
              this thriving area at little cost.  Indeed, except for travel                  
              costs for the outside speakers, all of the funds will be used to               
              help defray expenses for graduate students and postdoctoral                    
              associates.//
