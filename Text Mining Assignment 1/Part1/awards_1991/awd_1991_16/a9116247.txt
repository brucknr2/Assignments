Abstract    :
              This award will support the purchase of necessary pieces of                    
              equipment for a multi-user plant growth and tissue culture                     
              facility at University of Arizona.  NSF and the University will                
              share the cost on a 1:1 basis.  Primary users of the facility                  
              consist of 17 mostly young faculty members in the Departments of               
              Plant Sciences and Plant Pathology.  The facility will be used                 
              for research and teaching in the areas of plant growth and                     
              development, plant physiology/biochemistry, plant                              
              genetics/molecular biology, transformation technology, and host-               
              pathogen interactions.  Specific pieces of equipment include                   
              growth chambers, light banks, Laminar flow hoods, and shakers,                 
              and they will be installed in the new Agricultural Research                    
              Laboratory.
