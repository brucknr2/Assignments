Abstract    :
                   Iron-dependent metabolic processes are central to nutrient                
              uptake and energy transduction.  For open ocean phytoplankton,                 
              restricted iron availability may control the patterns and                      
              magnitude of primary productivity in surface waters.  This                     
              research will determine the iron use efficiencies for several                  
              ecologically important phytoplankton species.  The work will                   
              originally focus on a strain of Synechococcus.  Iron-limited                   
              continuous cultures will be used to obtain cells adapted to                    
              several iron-controlled growth rate.  Dr. Rueter will measure                  
              the total iron content and the distribution of the iron into                   
              several well characterized proteins that may control energy and                
              nitrogen metabolism in these cells.  The work with Synechococcus               
              will lead to comparative studies with several other species,                   
              followed by direct competition experiments in iron-limited growth              
              conditions.  This work will provide an understanding of the role               
              of iron in phytoplankton metabolism in a parallel framework to                 
              that used by other investigators studying the efficiency of light              
              and nitrogen metabolism.  The efficient use of iron by individual              
              phytoplankton species is controlled by their strategies of                     
              regulation.  These strategies effect protein content and                       
              efficiency of growth processes and not only have competitive                   
              significance for those species but also help shape the community               
              structure of surface water ecosystems.
