Abstract    :
              In this project supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and                  
              Organometallic Chemistry Program, Joseph M. O'Connor of the                    
              University of Nevada at Reno will continue studies in the area                 
              of organometallic research at the interface of metallacycle and                
              carbene chemistry.  The goal of the research is development of                 
              new carbene coupling reactions which produce ring-expanded                     
              metallacycles of iridum, rhodium, or cobalt and ultimately                     
              four- and five-membered carbocycles.  Free carbene-carbene                     
              products may also be generated.  In addition to the synthetic                  
              work, structural and mechanistic studies will be carried out in                
              order to clarify the effect of coordination geometry, ancillary                
              ligands, and ring substituents on the insertion process.

              This research directly impinges on the role of metal carbenes                  
              in alkene metathesis, alkene and alkyne polymerization,                        
              cyclopropanation chemistry and an impressive array of synthetic                
              organic methodology.
