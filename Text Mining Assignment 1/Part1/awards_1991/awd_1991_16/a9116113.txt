Abstract    :
              Smith         This research addresses the general problem of coding images  and
              video signals at low bit rates using a multirate  analysis/synthesis filter
              bank (or subband coding) framework.  Thus far, analysis/synthesis filter banks
              for subband image/video  coding have been static with respect to the input.
              This research  explores new classes of multirate filter banks that:  1.    
              dynamically change with the input signal to enable higher  quality
              representations; and   2.     simultaneously preserve all of the aliasing
              cancellation and  high quality reconstruction properties achievable with 
              conventional filter banks.         New methods for quantization and coding
              based on image  modeling and vector quantization are also being studied.  These
               are intended to operate in synchrony with the adaptive multirate  filter
              banks. While this work focuses primarily on achieving high  quality compression
              at low bit rates, extensions of these  concepts to higher rates are also being
              considered.
