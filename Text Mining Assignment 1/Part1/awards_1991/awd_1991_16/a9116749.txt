Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Funds are requested for the purchase of a Finnigan MAT 252 light               
              isotope ratio mass spectrometer with a "Kiel device" and ancillary             
              equipment.  This spectrometer will be dedicated primarily to CO2               
              analysis, primarily for the analysis of very small individual                  
              samples of carbonate, but also with later anticipated analysis of              
              ice, water and organic matter.  Funding from NSF will be matched               
              with moneys from the Pennsylvania State University.
