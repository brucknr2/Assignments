Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                  The Creede vein district is a world-class epithermal base                 
              metal sulfide deposit associated with a large Tertiary caldera                 
              cluster in Colorado.  Because the sedimentary, diagenetic and                  
              hydrothermal history of the volcaniclastic sediments filling the               
              Creede caldera moat is critical to understanding the cycling of                
              fluids, sulfur and metals into the district vein mineralization,               
              we propose a comprehensive investigation of fine-scale (<30 um)                
              sulfur isotopic systematics in the moat sediments using the SHRIMP             
              ion microprobe.  Microbeam techniques of stable isotope analysis               
              offer great insight into mineralizing processes, because minerals              
              contain more information concerning their origins and subsequent               
              modifications than can be obtained by conventional bulk isotopic               
              sampling and analytical techniques.                                            
                                                                                             
                   The principal investigators will apply their experience in                
              resolving fine-scale sulfur isotopic variations in lacustrine and              
              volcanic environments to the Creede moat sediments, in cooperation             
              with bulk isotopic studies proposed by other Creede project                    
              scientists.  In particular, they will focus on microscopic sulfur              
              isotope variations that record critical sedimentary and diagenetic             
              events, as well as any contribute towards an improved Creede model,            
              and will advance our understanding of the timing and interplay of              
              sedimentary, diagenetic and hydrothermal ore-forming processes in              
              shallow crustal environments.
