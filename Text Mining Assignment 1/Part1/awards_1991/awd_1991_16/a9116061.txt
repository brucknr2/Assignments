Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The inability to identify marine invertebrate larvae to the                    
              species level is a common stumbling block to many field studies                
              of larval ecology.  Larvae within taxonomic groups such as                     
              barnacles, bivalves, and starfish are often so morphologically                 
              similar between species that no identification to the species                  
              level is possible based on appearance.  Though research is                     
              underway on several novel techniques for identification of                     
              larvae, none has solved the problem as yet.  In contrast,                      
              identification of larvae using mitochondrial DNA is a method that              
              exists right now, and with a little development can be used for                
              screening large numbers of larvae.                                             
                                                                                             
              Drs. Olson & Kocher have already used mtDNA technology for                     
              identifying sea cucumber larvae. Now they will, 1) develop                     
              methods for screening large numbers of larvae using genetic                    
              probes, 2) establish a mtDNA sequence database for deep sea                    
              echinoderm species, and 3) utilize the techniques to answer                    
              questions about the vertical location of deep sea echinoderm                   
              larvae.  They will work on echinoderms because they are a phylum               
              for which there exists substantial mtDNA sequence data already                 
              and the universal PCR primers are known to work well for them.                 
              However, the methods developed will be applicable to all marine                
              invertebrate larvae.
