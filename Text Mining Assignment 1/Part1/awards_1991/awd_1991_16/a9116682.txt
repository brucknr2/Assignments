Abstract    :
                   Research in a broad selection of topics in theoretical                    
              gravitation will be continued at Washington University.                        
              Professor Suen will study various classical, semi-classical                    
              and quantum systems in general relativity and cosmology.  The                  
              elasticity of a black hole horizon interacting with its                        
              environment will be analysed.  A study of the properties and                   
              the formation process of oscillating soliton stars will be                     
              carried out.  Gravitational collapses of quantum mechanical                    
              systems will be studied using the semi-classical Einstein                      
              equation.  Dr. Suen will also study his recently proposed                      
              formulation of quantum cosmology, which requires no ad hoc                     
              theory of initial conditions.  Also of interest is the                         
              probability of having the universe tunneling from one                          
              classical trajectory to another in terms of the quantum                        
              cosmological wave function.
