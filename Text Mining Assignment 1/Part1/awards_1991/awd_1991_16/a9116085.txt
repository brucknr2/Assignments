Abstract    :
              An integrated device capable of performing edge and motion                     
              detection in real time for image processing system is to be built.             
              The device is based on the "silicon retina" of Carver Mead, but                
              adds optical outputs, allowing the preprocessed images to be fed               
              directly to further optical parallel processing stages.  These                 
              "retinas" are VLSI (very large scale integration) implementations              
              of neural networks which duplicate many of the functions of the                
              vertebrate retina.  The technology used here, the addition of                  
              ferroelectric liquid crystal light modulators to standard CMOS                 
              (complementary metal oxide semiconductor) VLSI, can utilize the                
              full repertoire of VLSI electronic functionality including                     
              photodetection, and can be applied to individual die, making for               
              rapid research iterations and the economical application to custom             
              products.  its 104Hz readout rate is accomplished with minimal                 
              power dissipation, and is more than fast enough for neural image               
              processing.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              The work focuses on developing techniques for isolating read light             
              from write light in these completely optically interconnected                  
              devices, and on developing retinal binocular images.  The device               
              should have many commercial applications for example, in the fields            
              of optical inspection and robotics.
