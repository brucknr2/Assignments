Abstract    :
              This project is for field and related studies on the 7,200-yr old              
              Socompa volcano avalanche deposit, north Chile, which is arguably              
              the best exposed large avalanche deposit in the world.  Fieldwork              
              will focus on elucidating the original shape and stratigraphy of               
              the volcano, determining the trajectories within the avalanche of              
              individual components of the original volcanic edifice and                     
              deciphering the post-collapse history of the volcano.  Digital                 
              elevation models and existing computational algorithms for the                 
              kinetics of moving avalanches will be used to model the                        
              trajectories of individual components and to determine the source              
              regions of debris streams within the avalanche deposit remote                  
              sensing data will be used.  All of these will be used to determine,            
              as far as possible, the kinetics of the avalanche itself.
