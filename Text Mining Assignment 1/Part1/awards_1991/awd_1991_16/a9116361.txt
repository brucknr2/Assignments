Abstract    :
              This award from the U.S.-Argentina Cooperative Science                         
              Program supports collaborative research in                                     
              neuroendocrinology to be conducted by Professor Bruce                          
              S. McEwen of the Laboratory of Neuroendocrinology at                           
              the Rockefeller University and Dr. Alejandro F. De                             
              Nicola of the Faculty of Medicine at the University of                         
              Buenos Aires, Argentina.  The focus of the project is                          
              to study the mechanism of action of aldosterone in the                         
              brain.                                                                         
                                                                                             
              The research will investigate the distribution within                          
              the brain and regulation by glucocorticoids and                                
              mineralocorticoids of mRNA's for the three subtypes of                         
              the alpha subunit of Na, K ATPase.  In situ                                    
              hybridization histochemistry will be used to localize                          
              and map mRNA's in various brain regions and to study                           
              their regional regulation by glutocorticoids and                               
              mineralocorticoids in male and female rat brains where                         
              there may also be sex differences and estrogen                                 
              affects.  The award will foster continuation of a                              
              fruitful U.S.-Argentina collaboration.
