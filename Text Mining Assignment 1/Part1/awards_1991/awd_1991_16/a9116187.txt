Abstract    :
              In this project funded by the Theoretical and Computational                    
              Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Frederick will                    
              develop two new approaches for the accurate evaluation of the                  
              quantum dynamics of large molecular systems.  One involves the                 
              reduction of large systems to effective model systems of                       
              manageable size including only the critical degrees of freedom.                
              The other develops new algorithms to permit treatment of the                   
              larger system directly.  Application will be to the photo-                     
              chemistry of organic molecules containing extended pi-systems                  
              such as benzophenone, biphenyl, and cis-stilbene.

              One of the outstanding challenges of modern theoretical                        
              chemistry is the modification of standard quantum chemical                     
              methods which are both accurate and feasible on modern                         
              computers to larger molecular systems where much interesting                   
              chemistry is to be explored.  Frederick has a unique direction                 
              of approach and offers promise of making a substantial advance.
