Abstract    :
              In terms of hardware capabilities, distributed/parallel computing is a         
              technical reality today.  With modern workstations and networking,             
              users can compute on workstations on remote compute servers, or even           
              on ensembles of computers, running compute-intensive kernels in                
              parallel by exploiting idle CPU cycles on networks.  However,                  
              substantial knowledge about networking and parallel/distributed                
              computing is required to achieve this.                                         
                                                                                             
              The goal of this SBIR Phase II project is to build a state-of-the-art          
              software package that will bring this immense potential power to the           
              user's own workstation, except they will run many times faster.  The           
              package will be based on CLAM(R), a powerful, interactive software             
              environment for computation and visualization, designed, developed and         
              marketed by Scientific Computing Associates, Inc.                              
                                                                                             
              The Phase I work proved the feasibility of seamlessly accessing local          
              external libraries and demonstrated CLAMshell(TM), a Mac-like user-            
              friendly front end for CLAM.  The phase II work will complete the              
              research on two approaches:  (1) parallelizing the compute intensive           
              kernals of CLAM's internal back end (2) enhancing CLAM's foreign               
              procedure interface to permit access to procedures which run on other          
              computers (including parallel supercomputers) or over a computer               
              network in a distributed/parallel fashion.
