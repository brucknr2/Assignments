Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will review current conditions of the nation's                    
              infrastructure.  The objective is to determine recent                          
              advances in applicable technologies and applications in all                    
              pertinent disciplines of Civil Engineering.  These results                     
              will become the basis for recommendations for current                          
              research to meet the needs of the 21st century.
