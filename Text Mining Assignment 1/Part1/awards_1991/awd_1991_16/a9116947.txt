Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The project examine the use of vapor permeation for                            
              dehydration of organic compounds or for separations of                         
              mixtures of organic compounds.  An apparatus will be built for                 
              studying vapor permeation mechanisms determine the effects of                  
              several operating variables (feed composition, permeate and                    
              retentate pressures, and temperature), and compare the method                  
              to pervaporation under comparable conditions.  Membrane                        
              materials include poly (vinyl alcohol) - poly (acrylonitrile)                  
              composites.  Separation of mixtures of isobutylene/water and                   
              acetic acid water will be studied, because they are of                         
              scientific and substantial industrial interest.  The results                   
              should lead to development of economic and energy saving                       
              separation technologies.
