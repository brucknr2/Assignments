Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This grant provides partial support for graduate students to attend            
              the 1991 Gordon Research Conference on Solid State Studies in                  
              Ceramics. The theme of the conference is "Ceramics with Super                  
              Electrical and Super Mechanical Properties" and the goal is to                 
              bring together members of the electronic and structural ceramics               
              community to discuss advanced scientific topics of mutual interest.            
              The students will benefit from the opportunity to associate with               
              some of the most respected members of their field.
