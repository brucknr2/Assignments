Abstract    :
                 Professors De Lucia and Herbst are supported by a grant from                
              the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to continue their                  
              studies of radiative and collisional preperties involving small                
              fundamental molecular species.  Using the tools of millimeter                  
              and submillimeter spectroscopy, De Lucia and Herbst are                        
              studying the collisions of gas phase species at very low                       
              temperatures (below 5 K), the mechanisms and the modeling of                   
              intermolecular rotational energy transfer, and the spectroscopy                
              of internal rotor states in various simple molecules.

              This collaborative experimental and theoretical program                        
              provides important basic scientific information of potential                   
              use in various diverse fields, including molecular                             
              astrophysics, quantum electronics, and atmospheric science.
