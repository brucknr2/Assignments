Abstract    :
              This project, in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organo-                       
              metallic Chemistry Program, involves an investigation of the                   
              basic reactivity patterns of decaborane and derivatives, and of                
              cyclopolymerization reactions of diallyl derivatives of various                
              nonmetal elements.  Of especial interest in the former area are                
              transition metal derivatives of decaborane that might serve as                 
              precursors for metal borides, in addition to new compounds of                  
              various metalloids.  In the latter area, ring opening reactions                
              at the nonmetal center will lead to functional groups that can                 
              be used to specifically tailor the polymer for various                         
              applications.

              The immediate goal of this project is to further advance our                   
              fundamental knowledge of chemical reactivities.  Ultimately, it                
              is such knowledge that will allow the development of new and                   
              advanced materials.
