Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A two year funding is provided for stable isotopic analysis at                 
              three ODP Sites to constrain the history of deep water                         
              circulation in the late Pliocene and the strength of North                     
              Atlantic Deep Water formation during the warmer climates.  The                 
              study will help resolve the controversy whether North Atlantic                 
              Deep Water was weaker or stronger during warm Pliocene.
