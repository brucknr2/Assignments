Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Although our understanding of the complexity of the microbial                  
              food web has increased tremendously over the past several                      
              years, there has been little appreciation to date of the                       
              effects of trophic dynamics on the regenration of nitrogen.                    
              Dr. Glibert's work to date leads us to believe that total                      
              nitrogen regeneration in a natural food web is greater than                    
              that contributed by the component popultions, and that this                    
              effect is a nonlinear function of macrozooplankton density.                    
              This hypothesis has important consequences for how we measure                  
              the regeneration of nitrogen, and implies that commonly-used                   
              size-fractionation techniques may lead to underestimates of                    
              total regeneration.  If the magnitude of this bias is large,                   
              even if only under certian conditions, then our perspective of                 
              the balance between "new" and "regenerated" nitrogen may also                  
              be biased.  In these studies Dr. Glibert and collaborators will                
              use several newly-developed techniques to determine the                        
              magnitude of the effect of these interactions under a range of                 
              conditions and the major processes contributing to this effect.                
              The significance of these studies lies in elucidating the                      
              complex role of macrozooplankton in controlling the                            
              regeneration of nitrogen and how their interactions with other                 
              components of the plankton food web regulate the flow of                       
              nitrogen.
