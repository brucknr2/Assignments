Abstract    :
              The project focuses on the management storage and analysis of                  
              large scientific databases. A cornerstone of the activity is the               
              Karhunen-Loeve procedure which in a mathematically well defined                
              sense provides an intrinsic and ideal representation for many                  
              forms of scientific data. The development of the snapshot method               
              allows this procedure to be applied to hitherto unmanageably-                  
              large databases. This method is applied to the following cases:                
              optical imaging of cortical activity using fluorescent dyes; a                 
              new simulation of the turbulent jet; and sea surface measurements              
              obtained by telemetric means. Each of these cases leads to                     
              gigabyte or larger datasets. Lossy and lossless data encoding                  
              techniques are developed and melded in this project. New methods,              
              including the wavelet and Wigner transform are developed for the               
              visualization and presentation of large databases.  Application                
              of these methods to on-the-fly data acquisition and compression                
              of large datasets is investigated.  Results of this project will               
              provide a set of tools which will make possible the collection,                
              compaction, analysis, rapid exploration, visualization,                        
              progressive browsing and communication of exceedingly large                    
              databases of the sort encountered in engineering, pattern                      
              recognition and electrophysiology.
