Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program                 
              will help the Department of Chemistry at the College of                        
              Environmental Science and Forestry of the State University of                  
              New York acquire a high-brillance, rotating anode X-ray                        
              generator unit.  This  instrument will be equipped for                         
              computer-controlled X-ray diffraction in both wide angle and                   
              small angle modes, complete with control and data processing                   
              software, for use in diffraction analysis of powders, fibers,                  
              and films.  The areas of chemical research that will be                        
              enhanced by the acquisition are the following:                                 
                                                                                             
              1)  Crystallinity studies of materials for the construction of                 
                  energy efficient membranes used in organic and azeotropic                  
                  liquid separation;                                                         
                                                                                             
              2)  Structural characterization of membrane mimetic systems                    
                  for energy conversion;                                                     
                                                                                             
              3)  Crystallinity and morphology characterization of composite                 
                  materials such as polymer alloys and blends, and surfaces                  
                  of catalysts;                                                              
                                                                                             
              4)  Crystal structure analysis of fibrous polymers used in                     
                  membranes and polymers blends;                                             
                                                                                             
              5)  Crystal structure analysis of polymers used in enhanced                    
                  oil recovery programs.                                                     
                                                                                             
              Single crystal X-ray is the most powerful analytical method for                
              structure determination of solids.  In synthetic inorganic,                    
              organic, bioinorganic and organometallic chemistry, single                     
              crystal X-ray diffraction is an invaluable tool to characterize                
              molecular structure.  The information gained from the knowledge                
              of the intermolecular composition and structure helps to                       
              develop new reactions of potentially general interest in                       
              catalysis or organic synthesis.
