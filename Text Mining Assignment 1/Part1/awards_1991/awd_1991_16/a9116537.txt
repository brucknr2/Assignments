Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Hydrothermal alteration of organic matter in sediments overlying               
              oceanic spreading centers such as the Guaymas Basin (Gulf of                   
              California), Escanaba Trough (Gorda Ridge), and Middle Valley                  
              (northern Juan de Fuca ridge) results in the generation of                     
              significant organically derived alteration products.  Hydothermal              
              experiments will be conducted in the laboratory at 200-400oC and               
              300 bars to constrain better factors that regulate the generation              
              and stability of organic compounds and the extent and nature of                
              organic-inorganic interactions.  Experiments containing natural                
              sediments and seawater type fluids or varying composition will                 
              allow detailed quantitative characterization of organic alteration             
              products as a function of time, temperature, and sediment and fluid            
              composition, and identity sources and sinks for these species in               
              natural hydrothermal systems.  The sediment alteration experiments             
              will be used to calibrate paleogeothermometers based on the                    
              relative abundance and distribution of thermally altered organic               
              species for use in ridge crest hydrothermal systems.  The results              
              of this study will be applied to natural environments to evaluate              
              geochemical conditions during hydrothermal sediment alteration and             
              to constrain the time-temperature history of sediment-covered                  
              spreading centers.
