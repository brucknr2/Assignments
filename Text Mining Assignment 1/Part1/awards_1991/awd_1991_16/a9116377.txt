Abstract    :
              This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the                      
              catalytic antibody work of Professor Kim Janda at Scripps                      
              Clinic.  Specifically tailored antibody catalysts for the                      
              synthesis of organic and biological molecules will be made and                 
              studied.  Antibodies which will survive in water                               
              miscible/immiscible solutions will be made and examined.                       
              Haptens will be synthesized which are designed to elicit                       
              antibodies which can catalyze peptide bond formation and the                   
              catalytic properties of the resulting antibodies will be                       
              studied.  The use of antibodies to catalyze ring forming                       
              reactions will also be explored.                                               
              %%%                                                                            
              The ability of antibodies to increase the rate of organic and                  
              biological transformations will be examined.  The immune system                
              of mice will be induced to produce these antibodies by                         
              injection of molecules which correspond in structure to the                    
              highest energy point between the starting materials and                        
              products of these transformations.  These studies are important                
              since they will provide proteins designed to catalyze                          
              specific reactions for which no natural enzymes are available.
