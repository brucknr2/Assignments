Abstract    :
              North Carolina State University and North Carolina A&T State                   
              University are jointly establishing the NSF/AEMP Interinstitutional            
              Fellowship Program.  The primary objective of the proposed program             
              is to increase the number of African-Americans pursuing doctorates             
              in engineering and qualifying for academic and research careers.               
              A secondary objective is to establish a model for similar programs             
              at other universities.  In brief, the program will provide                     
              approximately eight full fellowships for minority, women, or                   
              disabled students, but focusing initially on African-American                  
              students.  The program will provide full fellowship support during             
              the first, second, and fifth years of doctoral study (following the            
              BS) and research assistantships and supplementary fellowships                  
              during the third and fourth years.  The program will also provide              
              full payment of tuition and fees and funds in support of                       
              publication preparation, travel, and minor equipment purchases by              
              fellows for up to five full years of study.  Important components              
              of the program are to make doctoral study more attractive and to               
              accelerate progress toward the degree by providing full support                
              during the time when a student is preparing for research and                   
              afterward, when the student is writing the dissertation.  During               
              the research phase the student would receive support as a graduate             
              research assistant supplemented by a reduced fellowship stipend.               
              This would allow the student, during this period, to concentrate               
              fully on completing the research requirements associated with the              
              PhD degree.
