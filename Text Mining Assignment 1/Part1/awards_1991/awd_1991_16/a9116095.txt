Abstract    :
              This is a parallel study with MSS-9116093. The objective is                    
              to involve stochastic analysis of failure probabilities for                    
              seismically excited systems exhibiting soil-structure                          
              interaction phenomena. The models considered will take into                    
              account kinematic coupling between the free-field motion of                    
              the soil and the rigid motion of the foundation, inertial                      
              coupling between the motion of the soil-foundation and the                     
              motion of the attached structure, and non-linear behavior                      
              of the soil medium. Both circular and rectangular surface                      
              supported rigid foundations will be considered. The                            
              applicability of simplified stochastic methods previously                      
              used primarily for structural engineering problems will be                     
              investigated by comparing their results with those of Monte                    
              Carlo numerical simulation.
