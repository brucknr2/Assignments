Abstract    :
              This award from the U.S.-Argentina Cooperative Science                         
              Program supports research in biology to be conducted by                        
              Dr. Jose R. Lemos of the Worcester Foundation for                              
              Experimental Biology, Dr. Roger Y. Tsien of the                                
              University of California, San Diego and Dr. Ernesto J.                         
              Podesta of the University of Buenos Aires, Argentina.                          
              The project focuses on the fact that the interaction of                        
              a peptide with the appropriate receptors on a cell                             
              surface, and the subsequent signal transduction are some                       
              of the most important steps in the mechanism of peptide                        
              hormone action. The approach will allow study of the                           
              mechanism of peptide hormone stimulation of steroid                            
              secretion.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              The aim of the project is to understand stimulus-                              
              secretion coupling.  Using state-of-the-art techniques,                        
              the investigators will examine the compartmentalization                        
              of the cAMP-mediated response of individual Leydig cells                       
              to hormonal stimulation.  The award will allow                                 
              continuation of a productive U.S.-Argentina                                    
              collaboration.
