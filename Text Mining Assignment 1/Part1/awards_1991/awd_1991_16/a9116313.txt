Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The development of new techniques in molecular biology has opened              
              many new channels for investigating anthropological questions.  Key            
              among these new techniques is the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)              
              which allows the quantitative amplification of exceptionally small             
              quantities of DNA.  This has led to the generation of DNA samples              
              from ancient soft tissues and bone.  However, one unresolved                   
              problem derives from the sensitivity of PCR; contamination with                
              modern DNA can confound the results.                                           
                                                                                             
              This Exploratory Grant for Anthropological Research will allow the             
              conduct of several well controlled experiments to test                         
              decontamination procedures.  The PI will artificially contaminate              
              forensic samples with genetically engineered DNA.  After using                 
              various protocols the PCR amplified DNA can be compared to expected            
              results for precise determination of the efficiency of                         
              decontamination.                                                               
                                                                                             
              In addition, though techniques for isolating DNA from bone have                
              been published, there are no protocols specific to teeth.  The                 
              research also will optimize the conditions for isolating DNA from              
              teeth.  As teeth are the hardest part of the body and the most                 
              likely to be preserved this technique will have potential uses in              
              forensic and evolutionary applications.
