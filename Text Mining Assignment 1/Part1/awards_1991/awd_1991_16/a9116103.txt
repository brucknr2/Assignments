Abstract    :
                   Professor Kapouleas will study several topics in differential             
              geometry: constant mean curvature surfaces, harmonic maps, real                
              Einstein manifolds, and the classification of surfaces. He will use            
              a method of "patching" to construct constant mean curvature                    
              surfaces with prescribed topological properties. The "patching"                
              process will also be used to try to construct new examples of real             
              Einstein manifolds. The full extent of the usefulness of the                   
              patching process is not known and one of the goals of the research             
              is to explore other areas in which this tool might be useful.                  
                   The research supported by this proposal should result in a new            
              method of obtaining global information from local information. The             
              standard method up to this point for obtaining global solutions to             
              partial differential equations on surfaces involved working with               
              the abstract space of possible global solutions to the equation.               
              The method to be used in this research involves putting small parts            
              of solutions together much like one puts together a jigsaw puzzle.             
              The method has already been successful on one class of problems and            
              the principal investigator will now try to extend the method to                
              other classes.
