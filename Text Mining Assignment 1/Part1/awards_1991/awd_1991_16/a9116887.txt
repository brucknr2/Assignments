Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The theory of Lie algebras has played a significant role in               
              mathematical research during this century.  Important roles have               
              been played by finite-dimensional semisimple Lie algebras,                     
              modular Lie algebras and Kac-Moody Lie algebras.  The most                     
              dramatic progress in the classification and structure of finite                
              dimensional Lie algebras has been the recent solution of the                   
              classification problem for simple Lie algebras over algebraically              
              closed fields of characteristic p>0.  Despite this work, many                  
              important areas of research remain, including the                              
              characterization of important classes of Lie algebras (e.g.,                   
              nilpotent, solvable) by homological properties and the search for              
              structural results.  There has also been substantial work over                 
              the last decade on the representation theory of restricted Lie                 
              algebras of classical type.  While some of this work has been                  
              associated with the solution of the classification problem, much               
              more of it has been motivated by connections with the modular                  
              representation theory of semisimple algebraic groups.  Finally,                
              the study of the representation theory of affine Lie algebras has              
              been one of the most rapidly growing parts of algebra since its                
              inception twenty years ago.  The problem of finding explicit                   
              constructions of modules for affine Lie algebras has been                      
              attacked by various methods.                                                   
                   This project will support the Conference on Structure and                 
              Representation of Lie Algebras to be held from April 17-19, 1992               
              at Yale University.  Topics will include the classification and                
              structure of finite dimensional Lie algebras, representation                   
              theory of finite dimensional Lie algebras over fields of positive              
              characteristics, and representation theory of Kac-Moody Lie                    
              algebras.  The format will consist of plenary lectures of an                   
              expository nature by leading experts as well as some shorter,                  
              more specialized talks.
