Abstract    :
              In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program                 
              in the Chemistry Division, Prof. Bryan Kohler of the University                
              of California at Riverside will study the electronic structure                 
              of linearly conjugated molecules, the dependence of this                       
              electronic structure on molecular conformation, and the                        
              response of this structure to electrostatic perturbation.  To                  
              do this, powerful spectroscopic techniques will be used to                     
              obtain the absorption spectra of polyenes in supersonic beams                  
              and in low temperature mixed crystals.  Photochemical hole                     
              burning will allow the response of linear polyenes to external                 
              electric fields to be determined.

              Linear polyenes are organic molecules which are vital to                       
              processes ranging from vision to the fabrication of organic                    
              electrical conductors and the use of passive optical processes                 
              to add or subtract light frequencies in nonlinear crystals.                    
              The current studies will aid in a fundamental understanding of                 
              these diverse phenomena by helping to develop a clear picture                  
              of the electronic structure of these molecules and the response                
              of this electronic structure to electrical stimuli.
