Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              A simple numerical model, i.e, a 1.5 layer shallow water model,                
              will be used to study the dynamics of western boundary currents at             
              low latitudes (near the equator) and how they separate and interact            
              with the interior flow. Of particular interest to this study are               
              the effects of coastal geometry on the behavior of the western                 
              boundary current and associated eddies and the nature of the                   
              unsteadiness that results in transient eddy generation.
