Abstract    :
                   Professor Chen will work on the problem of prescribing                    
              curvature on manifolds which have the topological type of a sphere.            
              In addition, he will attempt to apply variational methods to                   
              reprove the classical uniformization theorem and prove an extension            
              of the theorem to surfaces with conical singularities. Variational             
              methods will also be used to classify solutions of some nonlinear              
              partial differential equations of differential geometry and to                 
              study solutions of nonlinear elliptic boundary value problems for              
              domains in Euclidean space.                                                    
                   The research supported by this award is frequently referred to            
              as global analysis. It attempts to find and describe global                    
              solutions to nonlinear partial differential equations on a surface             
              or manifold. These equations describe local properties of the                  
              surface such as curvature. The research, therefore, seeks to relate            
              local information to global information.
