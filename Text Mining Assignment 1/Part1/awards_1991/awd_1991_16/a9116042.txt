Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                                                                                            
              Results from present studies of boundary scavenging in the Pacific             
              ocean suggest that as much as 70% of dissolved particle-reactive               
              chemical species, like 10Be, may be removed from the ocean in margin           
              environments.  This prediction, however, is based on only a few                
              studies of margin environments in the eastern Pacific and presumes             
              that enhanced deposition of particle-reactive chemical species                 
              occurs in all ocean-margin environments.  In a contemporary study              
              in the western North Atlantic no evidence has been found for                   
              enhanced deposition of the radioactive tracers that are commonly               
              used to evaluate boundary scavenging.  A better understanding of               
              the factors that lead to very different removal efficiencies at                
              different margins is required before the ocean-wide transport and              
              fate of particle-reactive chemical species can be modeled and                  
              protected.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              This research will test two hypotheses to explain the absence of               
              boundary scavenging off the east coast of the U.S., one of which is            
              related to the presence of strong western boundary currents off the            
              east coast, and the other related to export of fine-grained                    
              particulate manganese.  A multi-pronged approach to test these                 
              hypotheses will be employed.   Specific tasks include;                         
              1) tests for boundary scavenging of 10Be in the Middle Atlantic                
              Bight,                                                                         
              2) an examination of samples of fine-grained particulate matter                
              collected by large volume in situ filtration to assess the                     
              enrichment of radiotracer concentrations in Mn-rich particulate                
              phases being transported away from the margin, and                             
              3) a study of boundary scavenging at an eastern North Atlantic                 
              margin to complement recent studies off the east and west coasts of            
              the U.S.
