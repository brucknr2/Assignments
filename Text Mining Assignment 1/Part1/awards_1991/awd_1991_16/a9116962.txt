Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Dr. McGrath has been instrumental in developing international                  
              cooperation in chemical engineering between Michigan State                     
              University and RWTH-Achen, as well as other institutions in                    
              Germany.  This visit will enable to further this effort and                    
              open new windows of opportunity for international                              
              collaboration in research by meeting key individuals and                       
              familiarizing himself with the key German institutions.  The                   
              utility of this effort is further enhanced by coordinating                     
              this trip with the visits of Dr. R. Wellek of NSF and Dr.                      
              Anderson of MSU.
