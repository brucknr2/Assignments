Abstract    :
              A crucial need for researchers in the area of science and                      
              technology studies is access to the works of scientists and                    
              engineers.  Traditionally, this has required travel to the archives            
              where the papers and other materials are kept.  In a few special               
              circumstances, the works have been published in scholarly editions.            
              Yet for certain purposes, even published papers are not sufficient             
              for the kinds of studies that researchers wish to undertake.  A new            
              technology, CD-ROM, allows easy reproduction of the original                   
              sources as well as computer searches of texts.  Under this grant,              
              Dr. Renn is seeking to establish an international collaboration in             
              order to enhance the accessibility of some of the major collections            
              in the history of science such as the Galileo collection in                    
              Florence and the Einstein Archive in Jerusalem.                                
                                                                                             
              In order to be able to assess the existing technical possibilities             
              for realizing this project, this grant provides support for an                 
              exploratory study over 8 months of various approaches to putting               
              the Galileo and Einstein papers on CD-ROM.  At the completion of               
              this feasibility study, a meeting will be held in Italy to discuss             
              future directions for the use of CD-ROM technology in the history              
              of science and technology.
