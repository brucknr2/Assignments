Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This grant supports a study of small, compact features in quasars              
              and other active galactic nuclei through a series of multi-                    
              frequency observations extending from the radio to gamma-ray                   
              emissions.  This research will increase our understanding of the               
              mechanisms that govern quasars, the most distant and energetic                 
              power sources in the universe.   The grant also supports monitoring            
              of nearby clouds of molecular gas to search for variability in                 
              their brightness at certain wavelengths that is expected as the                
              interstellar medium of our own Galaxy moves between us and                     
              background sources of radio emission.  This study will increase our            
              understanding of the content, structure and distribution of the gas            
              in the Milky Way.                                                              
                                                                                             
              This work, led by Drs. Alan Marscher and Thomas Bania of Boston                
              University builds the educational and research infrastructure of               
              astronomy by training new scientists in the technical skills                   
              needed to effectively use the new VLBA (Very Long Baseline Array),             
              which is now near completion.
