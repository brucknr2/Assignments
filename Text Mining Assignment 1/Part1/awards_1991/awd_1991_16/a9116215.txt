Abstract    :
              This award from the U.S.-Brazil Cooperative Science                            
              Program supports collaborative research in theoretical                         
              physics to be conducted, in the U.S. by Dr. Michael W.                         
              Guidry of the University of Tennessee, Knoxville and Dr.                       
              John O. Rasmussen of the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory                          
              and, in Brazil by Drs. Raul Donangelo and Filipe Canto                         
              of the Federal University, Rio de Janeiro and Dr. Mahir                        
              Hussein of the University of Sao Paulo.  The focus of                          
              the research will be to use semiclassical methods to                           
              gain a theoretical description of heavy-ion collisions                         
              when one of the collision partners is deformed.  The                           
              work could lead to a practical and reliable tool to                            
              interpret present and future heavy-ion experiments.                            
                                                                                             
              The project will extend previous calculations to a more                        
              comprehensive treatment of heavy-ion transfer reactions                        
              including the treatment of two- and one-particle                               
              transfer reactions, and will incorporate new ideas in                          
              nuclear structure such as the Fermion Dynamical Symmetry                       
              Model.  The formalism will permit study of a substantial                       
              body of high-spin transfer data for which there are                            
              presently few theoretical calculations, and should prove                       
              valuable for understanding transfer data that will                             
              become available with GAMMASPHERE and EUROBALL.  The                           
              project brings together a group of internationally known                       
              physicists who have collaborated well in the past.
