Abstract    :
              The purpose of this grant is to send the PI and two Philippino                 
              graduate students to the Philippines for approximately one month.              
              Last April the volcano Pinatubo, north of Manila on the island of              
              Luzon began erupting for the first time in 600 years.  All                     
              indications were that this was the beginning of a major eruptive               
              cycle which would endanger thousands of area residents including               
              the Americans stationed on Clark airforce base.  A major danger                
              is posed by lahars, rapid mud flows that occur when recent                     
              volcanic ash and rock debris is mobilized by monsoon rains or                  
              other sources of water.  The PI is an expert on Philippine                     
              lahars, having studied them with NSF support for several years on              
              Mt. Mayon, and the two grad students have also had experience on               
              Mayon.  Their presence at Pinatubo during the actual eruption                  
              will be invaluable on two counts; valuable data and samples will               
              be obtained which could not be after the eruption ceases, and                  
              their knowledge and advice will important in limiting the loss of              
              life and property should the eruption continue as is expected.                 
              Therefore a small grant for experimental research (SGER) award of              
              $8,500 is recommended which will cover their airfare and some                  
              subsistance during their anticipated stay in the Philippines.
