Abstract    :
              This project is in the general area of analytical and surface                  
              chemistry and in the subfield of organometallic electrochemistry.              
              During the tenure of this three-year continuing grant, Professor               
              Geiger and his students will pursue fundamental investigations of              
              one-electron and two-electron transfer reactions that are designed             
              to elucidate mechanistic aspects of these technologically                      
              important types of chemical systems.  Electrochemical and                      
              spectroscopic techniques will be used in conjunction with well                 
              designed molecular frameworks containing multiple metal redox                  
              centers to test through-space electron delocalization, the                     
              cooperative reactivity of adjacent redox centers, and long                     
              distance interactions between weakly coupled redox centers.  Also,             
              a sound experimental approach will be developed for comparing the              
              distance dependence of homogeneous electron transfer processes                 
              with their heterogeneous analogues.

              This research builds upon results obtained under Dr. Geiger's                  
              previous NSF grant, CHE-8603728, to provide basic insights into                
              fundamental aspects of conducting materials and of photosynthetic              
              and other biological electron transfer reactions.  Additionally,               
              these studies are important to further understanding the behavior              
              of mixed-valent compounds that function as industrially important              
              catalytic systems.
