Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              The primary objectives of this U.S.-Poland research project                    
              between Dr. Ajay K. Bose of Stevens Institute of Technology, and               
              Dr. Marek Chmielewski of the Institute of Organic Chemistry,                   
              Polish Academy of Sciences, Warsaw, Poland, is to synthesize                   
              chiral B-lactams, an important group of heterocycles including                 
              antibiotics.  Work will emphasize variously substituted optically              
              active B-lactams and their stereoselective conversion to versatile             
              synthetic intermediates as well as to natural products such as                 
              sugars, amino acids, alkaloids, and antibiotics.  The researchers'             
              capabilities in X-ray diffraction and other instrumental methods for           
              structure determination are complimentary; both groups share a                 
              common interest in synthetic techniques involving novel forms of               
              energy input such as high pressure, ultrasonic, and microwave                  
              radiation.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              This project in synthetic organic chemistry fulfills the program               
              objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading                
              experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to combine                     
              complementary talents and pool resources in areas of strong mutual             
              interest and competence.
