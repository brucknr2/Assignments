Abstract    :
              In this program in Experimental Physical Chemistry,                            
              Prof.Dunning (William Marsh Rice University) will use molecular                
              beam techniques to steer electrons loosely attached to parent                  
              atoms into a chemically active environment. This permits an                    
              unprecedented degree of control over electron catalyzed                        
              ionization reactions.                                                          
              %%%                                                                            
              Giant pseudo-atoms, up to hundreds of times bigger than those                  
              commonly available, will be prepared by Prof. Dunning (William                 
              Marsh Rice University). These atoms provide a powerful new                     
              source of electrons which Dunning will use to understand the                   
              fundamental basis of reactions which involve electron                          
              attachment and de-attachment -- processes which underlie an                    
              enormous variety of gas-phase chemical processes.
