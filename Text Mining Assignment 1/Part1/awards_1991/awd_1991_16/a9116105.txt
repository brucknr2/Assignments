Abstract    :
                   Fort Valley State College and the University of Oklahoma are              
              jointly requesting a three year grant of $300,000 in support of                
              student scholarships for participants in the FVSC-OU-Petroleum                 
              Industry Consortium's 3+2 Dual Degree Program.  As previously                  
              mentioned, our goal is to recruit and retain 10 academically                   
              qualified minority students per year into the program.  They                   
              estimate that $5,000 per student per academic year is required to              
              competitively recruit and retain mathematically and scientifically             
              talented minority students to this program.  In-state tuition as               
              FVSC and OU is approximately $1,600 per academic year at both                  
              institutions.  The remaining $3,400 per academic year would                    
              minimally cover room, board, books and supplies, and incidental                
              living expenses.  The University of Oklahoma's College of                      
              Geosciences will guarantee direct, additional scholarship support              
              or waivers of the difference between in-state and out-of-state                 
              tuition for students formally participating in the program while               
              at OU.
