Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will support a two-year U.S.-Japan cooperative research             
              project between Professor Wojbor Woyczynski, Center for                        
              Stochastic and Chaotic Processes in Science and Technology,                    
              Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Case Western Reserve                 
              University, Cleveland, and Professor Tadahisa Funaki, Department               
              of Mathematics, Nagoya University.  The purpose is to establish a              
              sustained, direct cooperation in the area of hydrodynamic limits and           
              nonlinear stochastic partial differential equations between the two            
              centers in the United States and Japan.  Other investigators involved          
              in the project are Professor Peter Kotelenez, Department of                    
              Mathematics and Statistics, Case Western Reserve University, and               
              Professor Kohei Uchiyama, Department of Applied Physics, Tokyo                 
              Institute of Technology, and Professor Hideo Nagai, Department of              
              Mathematics, Nagoya University.                                                
                                                                                             
              The objective of the research is to develop a broad spectrum of                
              techniques in the area of stochastic models for physically relevant            
              phenomena, in particular in the areas of physical chemistry and                
              geophysical fluid dynamics and oceanography,  The analysis,                    
              prediction and identification of the models would be based on                  
              statistical, mechanical, and probabilistic techniques that take into           
              account microscopic and mezoscopic behavior of interacting particle            
              systems to obtain, in the thermodynamic or hydrodynamic limits,                
              the macroscopic behavior as described by kinetic often nonlinear               
              partial differential equations.  The project will bring together the           
              different techniques developed by the U.S. and Japanese scientists             
              that will permit development of new techniques that utilize the best           
              parts of the two approaches.
