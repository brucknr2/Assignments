Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Two types of ocean circulation numerical models, the Primitive                 
              Equation Models (PEM) and the Reduced Equation Models (REM) will               
              be compared in order to determine which one is best-suited for                 
              various classes of oceanic problems with scales from several                   
              kilometers to several thousand kilometers.
