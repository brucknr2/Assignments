Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The proposed research is concerned with meteorological                    
              aplications of polarimetrically agile radar sensing, that is,                  
              determining properties of collections of scatterers (e.g.                      
              hydrometeors) such as size, shape, and orientation distributions               
              from measured scattering or Mueller polarization matrices.  It is              
              argued that processing of fully polarimetric data should be done               
              before time averages are made and correlations formed so that                  
              physical insight, based on vector wave scattering, can be focused              
              on identifying an optimal combination of polarization parameters.              
                                                                                             
                   The purpose of this work is to develop, test, and apply new               
              polarimetric data processing algorithms in both, coherent and                  
              incoherent scattering regimes.  The algorithms are aimed at 1)                 
              improving the accuracy of existing estimators of precipitation; 2)             
              providing new "signatures" of cloud and precipitation phenomena                
              e.g. rain vs. hail discrimination; 3) improving conceptual                     
              understanding and ranges of applicability of the coherent and                  
              incoherent polarimetric scattering regimes (scattering matrix vs.              
              Mueller matrix description).
