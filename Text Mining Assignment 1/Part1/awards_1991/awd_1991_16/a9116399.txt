Abstract    :
              This research is concerned with developing autonomous,                         
              cooperating, adaptive computational agents.  Expected                          
              applications of this research are in the control of mobile robots              
              capable of performing delivery, maintenance, and/or construction               
              tasks and of agents that gather and manipulate symbolic                        
              information over comuter networks.  The research will concentrate              
              on bounded-time action computation and learning mechanisms and on              
              combining these components in integrated agents able to function               
              cooperatively in dynamic, uncertain environments.
