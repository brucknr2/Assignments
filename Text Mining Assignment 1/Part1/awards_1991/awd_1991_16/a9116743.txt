Abstract    :
              A program to prepare minority graduate students for a career in                
              engineering education has been designed by the Faculty of the                  
              Watson School, SUNY-Binghamton, in conjunction with the engineering            
              Faculty of Morgan State University, a historically black university            
              in Baltimore.  The program, called The Partnership, features early             
              identification of academically talented engineering students at                
              Morgan State, and provides academic advising and support to smooth             
              the transition to graduate school at SUNY-Binghamton, financial                
              support through the NSF Graduate Engineering Education Fellowship              
              for the first three years of graduate study, and specific training             
              and encouragement for an academic career.  The Watson School and               
              Morgan State are uniquely suited to develop a successful                       
              collaborative program.  Both are relatively small, young programs              
              with a strong commitment to minority engineering education, links              
              with industry and active support for minority education from the               
              state governments.  Both have faculty members who are active in                
              engineering education societies.  They have already established a              
              faculty seminar exchange.
