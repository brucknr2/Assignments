Abstract    :
              A program has been funded by the Theoretical and Computational                 
              Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division to support a                       
              theoretical study by Simons in the area of negative-ion                        
              chemistry.  The research will investigate a variety of novel                   
              molecular anions of immediate experimental interest or whose                   
              study presents new experimental challenges.  Goals include                     
              quantitative information (e.g., vibrational frequencies,                       
              dissociation energies, electron binding energies) needed by                    
              experimental groups as well as conceptual information (e.g.,                   
              rates of vibration-to-electronic energy flow and bonding in                    
              small main group clusters) of interest to theorists.                           
              Double-Rydberg anions will continue to be studied, but the new                 
              work will also extend into investigation of main-group clusters                
              of polyvalent electron deficient species, ion-molecule reaction                
              energetics, and comparison of anion, neutral and cation                        
              reactive potential energy surfaces.%%%                                         
              The chemistry of negative ions has been a difficult frontier in                
              theoretical chemistry, presenting many methodological                          
              challenges to the investigator.  Nevertheless, it is currently                 
              an active experimental field in physical chemistry and the work                
              done with support from this grant will enable the predictive                   
              and interpretive assistance which theory has given to                          
              experimenters in the chemistry of neutral species to be                        
              extended to those working with negative ions.
