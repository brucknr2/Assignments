Abstract    :
                   Research in theoretical physics will involve work on a                    
              great variety of topics in elementary particle physics,                        
              statistical mechanics, and astrophysics.  The studies will                     
              include analyses of the effects of the strong nuclear force                    
              using an approximation in which the continuum of space is                      
              replaced by a discrete lattice of points, research in                          
              conformal quantum field theory (which has applications to                      
              particle and condensed matter physics), analyses of weak                       
              interaction phenomena in stars, studies of inflationary                        
              cosmological models and of candidates for the non-luminous                     
              matter in the universe, and work on numerous additional                        
              topics.  The discrete approximation to the strong nuclear                      
              force is the leading approach to understanding many of the                     
              effects of this force, weak interaction phenomena can play a                   
              decisive role in such processes as a supernova explosion, and                  
              the nature of the non-luminous matter is one of the major                      
              riddles of astronomy.
