Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              This proposal is a renewal for the existing grant entitled                     
              "Evaluating the Effects of High Particulate Fluxes at the Amazon               
              River/Ocean Boundary," which is part of the AmasSeds (A Multi-                 
              Disciplinary Amazon Shelf SEDiment Study) Project.  Three research             
              cruises to the Amazon shelf (August 1989; February, 1990; and May              
              1990; and November, 1991) have been completed successfully.  Time              
              series approach to understanding the chemical, physical, and                   
              geological processes active at the Amazon River/ocean boundary                 
              enables the investigators to resolve the variable influences of                
              river discharge, tidal resuspension, local wind stress, and the                
              intensity of coastal currents on particle-associated processes.                
              The specific topics of research described in this proposal include:            
              1) evaluating the effects of suspended sediment concentration on               
              the biological uptake and regeneration of nutrients and carbon; 2)             
              the release of radium isotopes to the water column from particles              
              and sediments and their use in tracking seabed/water column                    
              exchange processes; 3) scavenging of particle-reactive elements                
              from continental shelf waters; 4) uranium cycling during                       
              river/ocean mixing; and 5) tracing biological and physical                     
              processes on the Amazon shelf based on the distribution of carbon              
              and stable isotopic data.  Measurements of radioactive tracers in              
              the water column and seabed enable investigators to characterize               
              many of these processes on a variety of time scales (ranging from              
              days to hundreds of years).  This proposal requests support for two            
              additional years of research, which will be used to complete data              
              analyses, work up individual data sets, model the initial results,             
              and integrate the field measurements with the other research groups            
              taking part in the project.
