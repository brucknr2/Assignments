Abstract    :
              This award from the U.S.-Brazil Cooperative Science                            
              Program will support collaborative research in                                 
              theoretical physics to be conducted by Drs. Francis                            
              Halzen, Vernon Barger and Dieter Zeppenfeld of the                             
              University ofWisconsin, Madison and by a group led                             
              by Dr. Gil da Costa Marques at the Universidade                                
              Estadual Paulista (UNESP) in Sao Paulo, Brazil.  The                           
              focus us of the project is in the general area of                              
              high energy physics.                                                           
                                                                                             
              The research will be concerned with the                                        
              understanding of the "standard model" of the forces                            
              of nature and in the phenomenology of high energy                              
              neutrino and photon sources in cosmic rays.  The                               
              major themes of the work will be collider physics,                             
              future accelerators and particle astrophysics.  The                            
              collaboration will serve to broaden the base of                                
              cooperation that has been started between                                      
              experimental physicists at the two institutions.
