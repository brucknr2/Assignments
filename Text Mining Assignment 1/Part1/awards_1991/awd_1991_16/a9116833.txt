Abstract    :
              Arizona State University will support six women, minorities, and/or            
              persons with disabilities in an engineering graduate program                   
              designed to culminate in the awarding of a doctoral degree to each             
              student.  Five outstanding and complementary research areas are                
              proposed in this program.  These areas are: (1) Nanoelectronics,               
              (2) Manufacturing Quality Improvement, (3) Telecommunications, (4)             
              Intelligent Vehicle Highway Systems, and (5) Aerospace.  Each of               
              these disciplines is headed by a professor who is a recognized                 
              authority in his area of expertise.  Students will be recruited to             
              the program using a national advertising campaign based on the                 
              College's success with the Industrial Fellows Program.  Candidates             
              will be invited to campus to meet the faculty, students, and to                
              become acquainted with the research facilities available at the                
              graduate level.  Final selection will be made by the departmental              
              graduate committee, in conjunction with the PI's.  Immediately upon            
              selection the student will be assigned a mentor to assist in the               
              preliminary phase of his/her program.  ASU's effort to recruit                 
              underrepresented students is vigorously supported by the state                 
              legislature and the Board of Regents who have provided special                 
              funds for this purpose.
