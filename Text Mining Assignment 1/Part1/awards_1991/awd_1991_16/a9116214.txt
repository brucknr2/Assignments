Abstract    :
              The proposed project addresses the transition from                             
              theory to application of an approach to H00-control                            
              design based on skew Toeplitz theory.  The theory                              
              will be used as a new means for investigating                                  
              control problems for flexible systems.  The control                            
              problems to be considered are similar in spirit to                             
              those studied previously for finite-dimensional                                
              systems.  A significant difference is that the Laplace                         
              Transforms of distributed system components, not                               
              finite-dimensional approximations of them, will be                             
              used in the control design process.  Recent                                    
              theoretical advances have been made to address                                 
              control problems for distributed systems subjected                             
              to perturbations.  The proposer and her                                        
              collaborators have applied the theory to problems                              
              of controlling the vibrations of ideal, flexible beams                         
              subjected to an uncertain feedback time-delay and                              
              other perturbations.  Their beam studies suggest                               
              that applying the theory to more sophisticated                                 
              control problems for flexible systems is feasible.  It                         
              is proposed that flexible systems be analyzed in the                           
              frequency domain, pertinent H00-control problems                               
              be formulated and solved, and computer                                         
              experimentation with optimal and sub-optimal                                   
              designs be conducted.  This will also include the                              
              development of supporting computational methods                                
              and software.
