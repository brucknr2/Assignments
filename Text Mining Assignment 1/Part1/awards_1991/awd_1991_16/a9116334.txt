Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will support a two-year U.S.-Japan                                  
              cooperative science research project between                                   
              Dr. Hal Caswell, Biology Department, Woods Hole                                
              Oceanographic Institution, and Dr. Nanako                                      
              Shigesada, Department of Biophysics, Kyoto                                     
              University.  The investigators will collaborate                                
              on the development of mathematical population                                  
              models.  The models are intended to simulate                                   
              population processes more realistically than                                   
              current models through the incorporation of the                                
              effects of spatial structuring in local                                        
              populations.  Dr. Caswell specializes in                                       
              discrete models, while Dr. Shigesada                                           
              specializes in continuous models.  The                                         
              objective of the research is to investigate the                                
              relationships among different classes of                                       
              spatio-temporal models, particularly                                           
              contrasting and comparing discrete and                                         
              continuous approaches.  By clarifying the                                      
              conditions under which different kinds of                                      
              models are appropriate, the work will be of                                    
              widespread applicability to ecologists                                         
              interested in population modelling.
