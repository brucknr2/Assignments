              Doctoral Dissertation Student: Deborah E. Harkness; Title of                   
              Dissertation:  "John Dee's Mathematical Philosophy and the                     
              Language of Nature."                                                           
                                                                                             
              The "mathematization of nature" is one of the major factors in                 
              the success of modern science.  The ability to use mathematical                
              equations to describe the action of physical forces has allowed                
              scientists to achieve unprecedented degrees of accuracy in their               
              predictions.  Yet why nature should act in ways that can be                    
              described mathematically is not at all obvious even today.                     
              Philosophical arguments continue about the "reality" of the                    
              relationships described in scientific theories.  But whether the               
              mathematical relations are "real" or not, it is clear that they                
              are incredibly useful for science.  Ms. Harkness is examining                  
              John Dee's mathematical philosophy.  Dee was one of the first of               
              early modern natural philosophers who made the case for the use                
              of mathematics in the study of nature.  Her study explores the                 
              connections between the mathematical philosophy of John Dee and                
              the other facets of his natural philosophy to analyze the ways in              
              which mathematics became the dominant language of science during               
              the 17th century.  Drawing on manuscript and printed materials                 
              from 13 libraries in the United States and Great Britain, Ms.                  
              Harkness is examining Dee's intellectual corpus and is placing                 
              Dee's mathematical natural philosophy in the context of previous               
              and subsequent work on mathematics and the natural world.
