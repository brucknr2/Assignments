Abstract    :
                   Vacuum Ultraviolet (VUV) absorption cross section                         
              measurements of the atmospherically important molecules nitric                 
              oxide and molecular oxygen will be performed with a recently                   
              constructed VUV Fourier transform spectrometer that is unique in               
              achieving the very high resolution necessary for the                           
              determination of absolute absorption cross sections of molecular               
              bands possessing distinct rotational structure.                                
                   In the spectral region 175-205 nm, the penetration of solar               
              radiation into the atmosphere is controlled by the absorption of               
              the Schumann-Runge bands of molecular oxygen and some fraction of              
              the transmitted radiation is available to photodissociate NO in                
              bands below 192 nm.  The nitric oxide cross sections will be                   
              measured in the wavelength below 192 nm.  The molecular oxygen                 
              cross section will be measured in the wavelength region 175-180                
              nm where the lines of the Schumann-Runge bands are sharp.                      
              In the stratosphere, photodissociation in the Herzberg continuum               
              in the spectral region 200-240 nm, becomes the principal path for              
              molecular oxygen dissociation.  Above 242 nm, the Herzberg I                   
              bands, which are directly related to the Herzberg continuum, are               
              very sharp.  The absorption cross sections of the Herzberg I                   
              bands will be obtained at temperatures of 300K and the band                    
              oscillator strengths will be determined by the direct integration              
              of the absolute cross sections.
