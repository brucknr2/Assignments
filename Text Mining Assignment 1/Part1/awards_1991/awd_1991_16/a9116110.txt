Abstract    :
                   Many problems of applied mathematics and scientific                       
              computing involve non-normal matrices or operators.  Recently                  
              Trefethen and his collaborators have developed a new way of                    
              looking at such problems based on avoiding techniques involving                
              eigenvalues or more generally spectra, which can be ineffective                
              or misleading, and utilizing instead the sets known as                         
              pseudospectra.  This research project will involve further                     
              research in this direction.                                                    
                   Numerical analysis is an area of mathematics that continues               
              to be important, increasingly so as more scientific problems and               
              areas involve more sophisticated techniques in computation and                 
              computational technologies.//
