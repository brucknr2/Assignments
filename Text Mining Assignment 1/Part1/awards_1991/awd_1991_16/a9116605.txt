Abstract    :
              The goals of the proposed work are essentially twofold:  First,                
              to determine experimentally the physical properties of                         
              glycosaminoglycans (chiefly hyaluronate, heparin and chondroitin               
              sulfate) and their higher structures (proteoglycan subunits and                
              aggregates), and to relate these critically to contemporary                    
              polyelectrolyte theories, in order to verify, modify and improve               
              such theoretical understanding.  Laser light scattering,                       
              fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) and HPLC are                 
              the chief experimental techniques to be used.  Monte Carlo                     
              simulations will also be used as an adjunct for interpreting                   
              experimental results and modeling polyelectrolyte thermodynamics               
              and static properties.  Second, the properties of the                          
              glycosaminoglycans determined experimentally and interpreted                   
              within the framework of the best existing physical theories are                
              to be related to their diverse physiological functions, including              
              the compressibility and swelling pressure of connective tissues,               
              the control of solute flow, and glycosaminoglycan interactions                 
              with protein in such tissues.  These results, together with                    
              proposed experiments to study degradation processes of                         
              glycosaminoglycans, may also aid in understanding the basis of                 
              such connective tissue diseases as arthritis.
