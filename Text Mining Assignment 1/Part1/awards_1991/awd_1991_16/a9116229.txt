Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A group of four investigators requests funds to purchase a                     
              "Sensitive Manipulation and Recovery Technology" (SMART)                       
              System, which is a newly developed instrument with combined                    
              high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and fast                         
              protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) capabilities for                          
              microanalysis and purification of proteins and peptides.                       
              Two of the projects involve high resolution biochemical                        
              analysis of  bioactive peptides in neuroendocrine tissues.                     
              Dr. Victor May's research program is examining the                             
              regulators of neuropeptide Y biosynthesis, secretion, and                      
              mRNA expression using cultured primary superior cervical                       
              ganglion neurons.  Drs. Karen Braas and Edith Hendley are                      
              examining the roles  of neuroendocrine peptides under                          
              different physiological states.  Dr. Judith Van Houten is                      
              examining the chemosensory transduction pathway using                          
              Paramecium as a receptor cell.  The instrument offers                          
              exceptional sensitivity for the detection of peptides and                      
              will allow reduction in the use of experimental animals and                    
              radioactivity and will enhance the speed of data                               
              acquisition.
