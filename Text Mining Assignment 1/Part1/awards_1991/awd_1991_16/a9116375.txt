Abstract    :
                   The theory of Groebner bases is the underlying theoretical                
              base of the computational tools being developed in commutative                 
              and noncommutative ring theory.  Important results have been                   
              achieved in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry, including              
              algorithms for polynomial factorization and computation of the                 
              greatest common divisor of polynomials.  There are algorithms for              
              the primary decomposition of an ideal, the construction of                     
              projective resolutions and syzygies, the codimension of an ideal,              
              the Poincare and Hilbert series, and the determination of ideal                
              membership.  For noncommutative rings, Groebner bases are                      
              becoming increasingly relevant.  There are complications here                  
              since free algebras and path algebras are not Noetherian in                    
              general.  Recently, algorithms have been designed for finding                  
              syzygies, ideal membership, and computation of the Cartan                      
              determinant.  The theory itself has led to interesting questions               
              about algorithms and their implementations as programs.                        
              Theoretical questions on termination as well as effectiveness are              
              being studied.                                                                 
                   This project will support a Conference on Computational                   
              Algebra to be held in May 1992 at George Mason University.  The                
              conference will focus on some theoretical and practical                        
              applications of computational algebra, including topics in                     
              commutative and noncommutative ring theory which utilize Groebner              
              bases, as well as applications to other fields.
