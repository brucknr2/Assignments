Abstract    :
                   The University of California at Irvine and the University of              
              California at Santa Barbara propose to establish an NSF                        
              Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for High-Speed                 
              Image/Signal Processing.  The Center will focus on fundamental                 
              approaches to high-speed computation and will include the                      
              development of algorithm, computer software, computer                          
              architectures, and electronic circuits for industrial applications.            
              The Center will initially cover six principal research areas: 1)               
              Digital Signal Processing Algorithms, 2) Parallel Architecture, 3)             
              Pattern Recognition and Image Understanding, 4) Automatic Circuit              
              Design, 5) Image Formation and Sensors, and 6) Robotic                         
              applications.  The Center plans to support industries in several               
              areas including Robotics and Automation, Non-destructive                       
              Evaluation, Remote Sensing, Medical imaging etc.  Both the                     
              University of California at Irvine and the University of California            
              at Santa Barbara have an outstanding research record in high-speed             
              image/signal processing and the combined resources of the two                  
              universities will provide an outstanding interdisciplinary                     
              environment to attack the problems that will be addressed by the               
              Center.                                                                        
                   The Program Manager recommends $100,000 for the first year of             
              a five-year continuing award to be divided equally between the two             
              universities participating in the Center.                                      
                   Near the end of each 12 month period the Program Manager                  
              and/or the Director of the Engineering Centers Division will review            
              the progress of the Center on a number of criteria, including the              
              following:  (1) the extent to which the university-industry                    
              interaction and collaboration is developing; (2) the extent to                 
              which the support base is expanding; (3) the extent to which a                 
              robust research program is developing. If the review is                        
              satisfactory, the Program Manager will recommend support of the                
              next period of this continuing award.
