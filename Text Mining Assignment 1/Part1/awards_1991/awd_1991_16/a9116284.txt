Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              In this project, the PI's will attempt to detect and measure the               
              major mean deep currents paralleling the northwestern boundary of              
              the North Pacific by deploying nine current meter moorings on a                
              line southeastward of Hokkaido, Japan, for a period of 2 years.                
              The direct current measurements will be supplemented with some                 
              conventional hydrographic observations.
