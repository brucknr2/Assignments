Abstract    :
              In this project, the PI's will collect and analyze data on the                 
              distribution of Chlorofluorocarbons (CFC's) along 67 degrees South             
              in the Pacific, between New Zealand and the tip of South America.              
              Hydrography and other tracer data will be colected by scientists               
              from Oregon State University, Scripps Institution of Oceanography,             
              and the Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory, aboard the Soviet               
              vessel, R/V Akademik IOFFE.  This work constitutes a cooperative,              
              international study under the World Ocean Circulation Experiment               
              (WOCE), and is called line S-4 in the WOCE science plan.
