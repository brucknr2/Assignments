Abstract    :
              Title:  Japan JSPS Program:  Effect of Dilute Polymer on Laminar               
              Flow Patterns                                                                  
                                                                                             
              This award will provide supplementary support to enable Dr.                    
              Elisha Moses of the James Franck Institute, University of Chicago,             
              to conduct collaborative research with Dr. Takeji Hashimoto for 12             
              months at Kyoto University in Japan.  They will apply Moses'                   
              theoretical knowledge of physics to study the effect adding                    
              polymers to a solution has on the flow patterns obtained under                 
              laminar conditions.                                                            
                                                                                             
              For over 50 years, polymers have been added to solutions to                    
              reduce drag significantly in turbulent flows such as the Alaskan oil           
              pipeline; however, it has yet to be determined why polymers                    
              produce such an effect.  Dr. Hashimoto's expertise on the structure            
              and behavior of crystalline polymers and the experimental                      
              apparatus available at Kyoto University will complement Moses'                 
              theoretical expertise in fluid dynamics and non-linear phenomena.              
              Utilizing the Saffman-Taylor apparatus, the team plans to conduct              
              research on the structure and behavior of different crystalline                
              polymers introduced to a theta solvent, Dioctyl phthalate.
