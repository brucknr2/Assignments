Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Dr. Ludmil Bankov of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences'                        
              Space Research Institute will visit Dr. Roderick Heelis of                     
              the Center for Space Sciences, at the University of Texas,                     
              Dallas, to prepare a cooperative research project on high                      
              latitude ionospheric electrodynamics.  The resulting                           
              proposal is intended for consideration under the US-                           
              Bulgaria Cooperative Science Program and, if successful,                       
              should contribute to our knowledge of the interaction of                       
              the Earth's magnetic field with the sun by drawing upon                        
              data from two spacecraft (NASA's DE-2 and Bulgaria-1300)                       
              which simultaneously cross the high latitude region in                         
              different local time sectors.
