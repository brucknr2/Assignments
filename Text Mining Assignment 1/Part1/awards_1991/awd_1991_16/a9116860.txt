Abstract    :
              This research is to design I/O subsystems for high capacity storage            
              and associated object management systems tailored for the kinds of             
              data types encountered in scientific research on global climate                
              change related to the physical interaction of the ocean, land and              
              atmosphere. The researchers are constructing a prototype system,               
              populating it with real data and making it available to earth                  
              system science researchers on the National Research and Education              
              Network (NREN).  The prototype object management system is based on            
              significant extensions of the dual technologies of extensible                  
              database systems (POSTGRES) and redundant arrays of inexpensive                
              disks (RAID), developed in part under previous NSF support.  This              
              research relates to  Digital Equipment Corporations (DEC)  project            
              Sequoia 2000.  DEC has provided the researchers funded under this              
              grant with the equipment necessary to perform the research.
