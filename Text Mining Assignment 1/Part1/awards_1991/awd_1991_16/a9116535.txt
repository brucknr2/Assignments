Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Several lines of evidence suggest that the SE flank of Kilauea is              
              failing into the Hawaiian Deep, perhaps driven by recurrent cycles             
              of dike injection and stress build-up within the rift zones and                
              subsequent release by large earthquakes.  The PI's propose to                  
              acquire full coverage of side scan sonar and swath bathymetry over             
              the SE flank to determine the distribution of faults and                       
              landslides, and to interpret its degree of stability, the                      
              distribution and scale of mass waste deposits, and the potential               
              for future collapse.
