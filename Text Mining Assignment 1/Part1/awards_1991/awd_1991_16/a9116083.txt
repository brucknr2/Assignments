Abstract    :
                   The application of probabilistic methods to combinatorial                 
              enumeration has grown into an independent area of mathematics.                 
              There has recently been a resurgence of interest in classical                  
              combinatorial objects such as mappings, partitions, and                        
              permutations.  These objects provide a source of problems of both              
              theoretical and practical importance.                                          
                   This project will provide support for the International                   
              Conference on Random Mappings, Partitions, and Permutations to be              
              held January 3-6, 1992 at the University of Southern California.
