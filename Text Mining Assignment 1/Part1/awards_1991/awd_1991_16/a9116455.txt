Abstract    :
              The principal investigator, in collaboration with Drs. Yuen and                
              Halley of the University of Minnesota, will study the atomistic and            
              thermodynamic properties of H2O systems using computational                    
              techniques. The main aim is to theoretically predict the behavior              
              of H2O under temperature and pressure conditions that are                      
              impractical for direct experimentation. Data such as these will be             
              especially valuable to earth scientists studying the behavior of               
              H2O-bearing systems that exist deep within the Earth.
