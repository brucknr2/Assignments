Abstract    :
                   This award supports a study designed to evaluate the                      
              occurrence of deglacial Younger Dryas-style climatic events and                
              high frequency oceanographic variability throughout the late                   
              Pleistocene in the Sulu Sea of the Indonesian tropics.  The                    
              Younger Dryas is an abrupt and rapid climatic event which                      
              occurred between 11,000 and 10,000 14C years ago and had been                  
              primarily identified in paleoclimatic data from Europe and the                 
              North Atlantic high latitudes.                                                 
                                                                                             
                   This study will test the hypothesis that other Younger                    
              Dryas-style events and millennial-scale climatic variability                   
              occurred during other deglaciations in the late Pleistocene.  To               
              accomplish this a new detailed sampling scheme covering the last               
              750,000 years will be used in combination with the oxygen isotope              
              stratigraphic framework already developed.  The high-resolution                
              paleoclimatic records resulting from this study will provide                   
              valuable insight into millennial-scale variability and the origin              
              and regularity of abrupt climatic events in this strongly                      
              monsoonal region of the western tropical Pacific.
