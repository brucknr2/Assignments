Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will support the participation of ten U.S. scientists in a          
              U.S.-Japan Seminar on Gene Regulation and Expression in                        
              Mitochondrial Disease and the Aging Process.  The seminar, which               
              will be held December 7-12, 1992, in Honolulu, Hawaii, is being                
              co-organized by Professor Roderick Capaldi, Institute of Molecular             
              Biology, University of Oregon, and Dr. Takayuki Ozawa,                         
              Department of Biomedical Chemistry, Nagoya University.  The                    
              seminar will focus on the latest developments in basic research on             
              mitochondrial biogenesis, combining the interests of scientists who            
              study the basic process of oxidative phosphorylation with those who            
              study mitochondrial dysfunction in a wide variety of diseases and in           
              the aging process.  In addition to U.S. and Japanese scientists, the           
              seminar will include researchers from Australia.  This seminar                 
              follows a successful seminar in December 1987.                                 
                                                                                             
              The seminar topics are:  structure and replication of mitochondrial            
              DNA, regulation of mitochondrial molecular biology, biochemistry               
              of mitochondrial enzyme complexes, bioenergetics and relationship              
              to mitochondrial disease, nature of mitochondrial mutations                    
              associated with disease, mitochondria and the aging process, and               
              treatment of mitochondrial diseases.  The goal of the seminar is to            
              encourage the sharing of expertise, which could lead to                        
              collaboration in this important area of research.
