Abstract    :
              One of the most important applications of queueing networks is the             
              performance modelling of pedestrian and vehicular traffic within               
              and around facilities.  State dependent queues and finite queueing             
              network models are important tools for the topological design of               
              facilities, routing of occupants, and the capacitated allocation               
              and design of resources to accommodate occupant traffic.  It is                
              proposed to capture the nonlinear effects of customer traffic flow             
              within these networks.  In addition, applications of state                     
              dependent queueing network models for the topological design of                
              facilities, routing of occupants, and the capacitated allocation               
              of resources to accommodate occupant traffic within facilities are             
              described.
