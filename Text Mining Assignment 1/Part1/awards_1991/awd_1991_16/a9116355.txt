Abstract    :
              Description:  This project supports the participation by a group               
              of U.S scientists in the Fifth International and U.S.-Pakistan                 
              Symposium and Workshop on Natural Products Chemistry scheduled to              
              be held in Karachi, Pakistan in January 1992.  The Pakistani                   
              organizer is Dr. Atta-ur-Rahman of the H.E.J Postgraduate                      
              Chemistry Institute at the University of Karachi.  Topics to be                
              addressed will include: isolation, structure determination, and                
              synthesis of novel biologically active compounds from natural                  
              sources.  Isolation  methods will emphasize techniques                         
              appropriate to the isolation of water-soluble marine natural                   
              products as well as compounds from land organisms.  Special                    
              emphasis will be placed on synthesis as well as areas of                       
              biochemistry.  It is expected that additional support will be                  
              provided by a number of international organization to allow for                
              participation by scientists from South Asia and the Middle East.               
              There is also interest from a number of U.S industrial concerns                
              to send representatives at their expense to contribute to the                  
              discussions during the workshop section, and to explore the                    
              potential for collaboration and for developments in the technical              
              areas of the meeting.                                                          
                                                                                             
              Scope:  Past workshops in this series have resulted in high                    
              quality publications that were published in the U.S., Germany and              
              the Netherlands, and which serve as current references.  Several               
              collaborative activities have resulted from these workshops.  The              
              regional nature of the proposed 1992 meeting helps the wide                    
              exchange of information in that important region where much of                 
              the world's medicinal plants grow naturally.  The U.S. and                     
              Pakistani organizers are among the most qualified to direct this               
              project.
