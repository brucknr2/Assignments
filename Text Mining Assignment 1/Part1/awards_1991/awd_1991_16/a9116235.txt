Abstract    :
                   The major goal of this investigation is to determine the                  
              interactive effects of oxygen from overlaying water, microbially               
              produced sulfide and sedimentary organic carbon on food sources,               
              growth, and metabolic pathways in marine invertebrates living in               
              the benthos.  The investigators will determine the factors                     
              controlling acquisition of oxygen and organic carbon, and then                 
              test the hypotheses that (1) growth is controlled more by the                  
              interactions between oxygen, sulfide and organic carbon rather                 
              than any one factor, (2) that sulfide is not required for growth,              
              that Heteromastus will absorb more organic matter from deep                    
              sediment than from surface sediment, and that (3) tail-nipping                 
              increases ventilation.  We will also determine whether symbiotic               
              sulfide oxidation occurs in a deposit feeding polychaete.                      
              Preliminary investigations will be made on the effects of oxygen               
              and sulfide on metabolic heat production and state of the heme                 
              protein, cytochromes and hemoglobin.
