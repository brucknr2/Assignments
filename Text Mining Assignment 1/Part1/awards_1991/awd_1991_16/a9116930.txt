Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is the creation of new surface forms                
              and the determination of geometric and physical properties of                  
              surface.  The full sweep from constructive mathematics through                 
              algorithmic implementation in conjunction with interactive                     
              computer graphics display of surfaces will be utilized.  Both                  
              three-dimensional and multi-dimensional surfaces will be                       
              considered.  The research activity performed by Barnhill and                   
              others will involve the study of "surface" problems, where a                   
              "surface" is defined to be a function of two or more variables.                
                                                                                             
              The study of graphics and visualization is of considerable                     
              importance to a variety of users in the science and engineering                
              community.  Encouragement of such activity is increasingly                     
              important as the computational technology becomes more powerful                
              and available.
