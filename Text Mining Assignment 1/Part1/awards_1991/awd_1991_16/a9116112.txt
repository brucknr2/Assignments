Abstract    :
                   The development of design methodologies have generally been               
              associated with specific aspects of engineering design -- also                 
              known as DF (X) methodologies -- where DF (X) represents Design For            
              (x) and the X represents functions such as assembly, manufacturing,            
              quality, and even disassembly.  This project is directed at the                
              development of a generalized definition of DF (X) principles and               
              methodologies.  It will also be an investigation of the relational             
              mapping of generalized principles and methodologies to problem                 
              specific principles and methodologies.                                         
                   The operational tool is a relational data base linking DF (X)             
              applications and a general definition of this concept.  This effort            
              will assist in assessing if an effective translation exists between            
              abstract concepts of design and the application of design                      
              methodologies.
