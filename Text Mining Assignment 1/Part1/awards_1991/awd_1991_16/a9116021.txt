Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                  Sedimentary and volcaniclastic strata of the Oligocene Creede             
              Formation (San Juan Mountains, Colorado) encountered in research               
              and exploration cores will be examined in order to evaluate                    
              environments of sedimentation and controls on diagenesis in an                 
              intracaldera environment.  The project will complement ongoing                 
              surface study of depositional environments and diagenesis of the               
              Creede Formation.  Depositional environments will be identified                
              based on criteria established from outcrop study, and a sample                 
              suite based on sedimentary facies will be collected.  Petrologic               
              and mineralogic examination will also be used to identify the                  
              sequence of diagenetic events.  Stratigraphic correlation of core              
              and surface sections will provide a framework for interpreting                 
              cross-moat changes in depositional patterns and diagenesis.  The               
              results will provide (1) a more complete model for sedimentation               
              in an intracaldera environment, (2) a better understanding of the              
              complex diagenetic system that operated following Creede                       
              deposition, (3) constraints for modeling the structural and                    
              depositional evolution of caldera moat basins, and (4) a                       
              sedimentologic framework for testing the hypothesis that Creede                
              sediments played a major role in the evolution of fluids                       
              responsible for Creede district mineralization.
