Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Fundamental research to improve understanding of adhesion of                   
              metallic films to ceramic substrates using pulsed laser radiation              
              will be conducted.  A special feature of the research is the                   
              principle of laser enhanced adhesion.  It is proposed to extend the            
              results of previous                                                            
              work to other metals and ceramics, and to systematically explore               
              the atomic level aspects of the phenomena to gain an understanding             
              of the elementary basis for laser-enhanced adhesion.                           
              %%%                                                                            
              This research is expected to provide deeper fundamental                        
              understanding of basic properties of  thin films important to the              
              functionality of electronic/photonic materials and particular                  
              compositional and structural combinations and configurations                   
              relevant to microelectronic circuitry packaging.  From an                      
              application point of view, understanding these properties and their            
              relationship to materials synthesis and processing is highly                   
              beneficial to semiconductor circuit design and fabrication.  The               
              results will be of importance in a general way to the technology of            
              large scale, high speed integrated electronic and  photonic devices            
              and circuits.
