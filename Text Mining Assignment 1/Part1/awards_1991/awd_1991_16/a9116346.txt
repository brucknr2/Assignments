Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will support a two-year U.S.-Japan Cooperative                      
              Photoconversion/Photosynthesis Research Program project between                
              Professor Peter Ford, Department of Chemistry, University of                   
              California, Santa Barbara, and Dr. Mikio Hoshino, Solar Energy                 
              Research Group, The Institute of Physical and Chemical Research                
              (RIKEN), Tokyo, Japan.  The project will focus on the                          
              investigation of the fundamental chemistry of new metallo-organic              
              compounds that are photochemical precursors to nitric oxide (NO)               
              formation.  Nitric oxide is a known cardiovascular dilator recently            
              identified as the endothelium-derived relaxing factor in blood                 
              vessels and implicated as having an intercellular messenger role in            
              mammalian neural transmission and in the activation of                         
              macrophages to the bactericidal/tumoricidal state.                             
                                                                                             
              The collaboration will bring together the complementary talents and            
              expertise of two very productive research groups in the United                 
              States and Japan to investigate the synthesis and photoreaction                
              behavior of a variety of nitrosyl metal complexes with the long                
              term (speculative) goal of understanding fundamental principles                
              necessary for the design of new photodynamic therapy (PDT)                     
              drugs.
