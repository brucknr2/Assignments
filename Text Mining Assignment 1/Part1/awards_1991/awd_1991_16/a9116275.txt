Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              Benthic carbon oxidation, denitrification, and benthic fluxes will             
              be studied in continental slope and deeper continental margin                  
              sediments off the Pacific Northwest coast and the coast of western             
              Mexico.  Previous work off Washington State indicates that a                   
              significant amount of the expected carbon rain to shelf sediments              
              is swept off the shelf and is not accumulating or being oxidized on            
              the upper slope.  Others have suggested carbon oxidation in                    
              sediments near the base off the continental slope is anomalously               
              high and that these sediments account for a major portion of the               
              total ocean basin sediment metabolism.  As high sedimentary carbon             
              oxidation is frequently accompanied by denitrification,                        
              denitrification in slope and deeper sediments could be important in            
              the marine combined nitrogen budget.  Specific questions to be                 
              addressed are:  1) What are the carbon oxidation rates and                     
              associated benthic fluxes in slope and deeper continental margin               
              sediments, are rates anomalously high, and are there relationships             
              between flux and variables such as depth, distance from shore, and             
              dissolved oxygen?  2) What is the magnitude of denitrification in              
              these sediments?  and 3) What is the magnitude of the isotopic                 
              fractionation during denitrification and does it depend on whether             
              the denitrification takes place in the sediments or in the water               
              column?
