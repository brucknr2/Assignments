Abstract    :
              The University of Washington project will develop recruiting,                  
              retention and funding programs to substantially increase the number            
              of underrepresented minorities, women and persons with disabilities            
              entering graduate study leading to doctoral degrees in engineering.            
              A special emphasis on disabled students, with strong support from              
              the University of Washington Disabled Students Office, will improve            
              our ability to recruit and attract persons with disabilities.  This            
              project will significantly expand the amount of financial                      
              assistance available to the targeted groups, while intensifying the            
              recruiting and retention efforts required to attract, retain and               
              graduate more PhD students.  An extensive research program will                
              serve as one of the key elements of the recruiting and retention               
              strategies.  The multi-disciplinary efforts will serve as a magnet             
              in the attraction of outstanding graduate students to our                      
              nationally recognized research centers and programs.  NSF funding              
              will provide initial student support, while the College of                     
              Engineering develops sustaining fellowship and scholarship support             
              to perpetuate the program on a long-term basis.  Another key                   
              element of our recruiting and retention strategy is the five-year              
              grant period, rather than the total of eight PhD students that                 
              could be funded by NSF funds alone.  This will be accomplished by:             
              the use of tuition waivers; and aggressive and quick transfer of               
              candidates from NSF support to institutional support during the                
              grant period.
