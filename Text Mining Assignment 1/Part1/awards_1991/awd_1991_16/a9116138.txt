Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The primary objective of this US-Hungary research project                      
              between Dr. Gabor Speier of the University of Veszprem and                     
              Dr. Cortlandt Pierpont of the University of Colorado is to                     
              examine the fundamental steps involved in the copper-                          
              catalyzed oxidation processes that occur in both synthetic                     
              and biological systems.  Work will focus on intramolecular                     
              copper-quinone electron transfer, molecular oxygen                             
              coordination and activation of the reduced copper center,                      
              and stoichiometric and catalytic substrate oxidation.                          
              Funds for the project are awarded through the US-Hungary                       
              Joint Fund, Budapest, in accordance with established                           
              guidelines.
