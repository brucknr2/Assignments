Abstract    :
              The long-term goal is to understand the molecular mechanism of                 
              quinone reduction by photosynthetic reaction centers.  The focus               
              of the work in this area is to define the unique role played by                
              bound bicarbonate anions in plastoquinone reduction and protonation            
              by photosystem II of plants and cyanobacteria.  Use of site-                   
              directed and site-selected mutants of cyanobacteria has established            
              the involvement of specific amino acids of two separate photosystem            
              II reaction center proteins, D1 and D2, in the binding and                     
              functioning of bicarbonate.  Using the powerful combination of                 
              molecular biology and advanced biophysical techniques, the                     
              experimental work proposed here has two specific goals.  Additional            
              site-directed mutants of D1 and D2 in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803               
              and D1 mutants in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii will be constructed.               
              These will be used to identify the amino acid ligands and                      
              structural requirements for bicarbonate binding and resolve the                
              unique role of bicarbonate in the protonation of plastoquinone                 
              (i.e., QB- and/or QB2-) and define the identity and role of amino              
              acids involved in this function.
