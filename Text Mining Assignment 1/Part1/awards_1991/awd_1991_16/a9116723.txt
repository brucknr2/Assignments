Abstract    :
                   Developments in manufacturing technology now enable                       
              specialized industries such as shipbuilding to adopt Computer                  
              Integrated Manufacturing (CIM) to realize lower production costs               
              by integrated control of the material procurement, work flow,                  
              scheduling and assembly process.  Reflecting on the small                      
              differential presently found in the United States versus overseas              
              labor costs, these CIM gains could capture an international market             
              niche for the United States shipyards.  To develop a basis for                 
              introducing CIM.  This one and half day workshop will discuss both             
              practical problems and a research agenda for the industry.
