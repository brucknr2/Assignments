Abstract    :
              The main objective of the proposed conference is to foster                     
              the exchange and dissemination of state-of-the-art                             
              technical information between researchers, educators, and                      
              practitioners on the use of geomechanics and of                                
              geotechnical and geo-environmental methods in assessing and                    
              solving environmental problems. Conference topics will be                      
              categorized under: 1. Contaminant characterization; 2.                         
              Pollution and Hazard Assessment; 3. Hazard                                     
              Mitigation/Pollution Abatement; 4. Waste                                       
              Management/Regulatory  issues; and 5. Educational and                          
              Training Programs. There will be strong focus on the                           
              problems of the Mediterranean region, however, the topics                      
              covered will be of interest to the entire international                        
              community.
