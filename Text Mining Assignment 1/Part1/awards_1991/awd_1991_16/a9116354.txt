Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This three-year award supports U.S.-France                                     
              cooperative research between Brian Hauge of the                                
              Massachusetts General Hospital and Jerome                                      
              Giraudat of the Institute of Plant Sciences,                                   
              the French National Center for Scientific                                      
              Research.  The objective of their research is                                  
              to investigate plant-hormone action at the                                     
              molecular level.  They propose to characterize                                 
              plant hormone biosynthetic and response genes                                  
              in Arabidopsis.  They will clone genes which                                   
              are involved in abscisic acid (ABA) and                                        
              gibberellin (GA) biosynthesis.  Dr. Hauge is                                   
              experienced in cloning the GA biosynthetic                                     
              pathway.  This is complemented by Dr.                                          
              Giraudat's involvement in  synthesis of the ABA                                
              hormone and his expertise on hormone receptors.                                
              Their combined efforts, coupled with the clones                                
              and maps from their respective laboratories,                                   
              will facilitate rapid and efficient cloning of                                 
              these genes.                                                                   
                                                                                             
              The molecular and genetic characterization of                                  
              GA and ABA hormonal action will provide                                        
              important data regarding the mechanism                                         
              governing plant-hormone interaction.  Since                                    
              this project will also generate physical maps                                  
              in the vicinity of the interaction, the                                        
              collaboration will contribute to the overall                                   
              mapping of the Arabidopsis genome.
