Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a proposal to develop and apply the Direct Stress Solution             
              (DSS) technique to a three-dimensional circulation model of the                
              inner shelf (5 to 30 m depth). The model will then be applied to               
              study nonlinear tidal generation and the effect of wave-current                
              interaction on the mean circulation of the English Channel/North               
              Sea and the eastern Irish Sea. The results will also be compared to            
              existing models.
