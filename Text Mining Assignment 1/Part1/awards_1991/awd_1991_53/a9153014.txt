Abstract    :
              The microbial physiology laboratory, with a basic emphasis on                  
              metabolism and regulation, is an important aspect of                           
              undergraduate education in microbiology, and an area in which                  
              we excel at the University of Oklahoma.  Our microbial                         
              physiology laboratory is based on the van Niel approach                        
              (microbial diversity) coupled with a major biochemistry                        
              component.  Quantification of metabolites in experiments and                   
              field samples is critical for a successful laboratory.  We are                 
              requesting support for two HPLC's (UV detector and refractive                  
              index detector) and a gas chromatograph for this and other                     
              undergraduate laboratories.  They are to be used to quantify                   
              substrates, ions, and end-products of metabolism, and used by                  
              the students themselves. Currently, these instruments are not                  
              available in our undergraduate laboratories.  This hands-on,                   
              quantitative biological laboratory where students study their                  
              own environmental isolates is a very important part of our                     
              major's undergraduate education at the University of Oklahoma.
