Abstract    :
              A group of 18 institutions is working together to introduce                    
              students to realistic problems and to the technology (graphing                 
              calculators and microcomputers) that is capable of dealing with                
              them.  Existing materials are being adapted and will be implemented            
              on a state-wide basis.  The laboratory materials developed at the              
              University Hartford and the text materials being developed by the              
              Core Calculus Consortium (lead by Harvard University) are being                
              integrated into the new course.
