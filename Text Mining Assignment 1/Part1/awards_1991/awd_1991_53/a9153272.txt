Abstract    :
              Third semester calculus materials are being completed for                      
              teaching calculus as a laboratory course.  The work includes                   
              the expansion of the repertoire of classroom and laboratory                    
              projects, development of versions of alternate software and                    
              hardware environments, and completion of a high school version                 
              of the course.  The methods and materials for all three                        
              semesters are being evaluated and widely disseminated by                       
              workshops for college-level and pre-college faculty, by                        
              continued publication of a newsletter, and production of                       
              preliminary materials.
