Abstract    :
                    The Project is intended to improve career access for American            
              Indians into technological fields by increasing the entrance and               
              retention rate among American Indian students with potential for               
              science and engineering careers.  This proposal is being submitted             
              for continuation of the mentoring project with the three current               
              university sites, and the expansion of the program to five                     
              additional sites through the 1994-95 funding period.  The project              
              focuses on the improvement, continuation and expansion of the                  
              "mentorship" model.
