Abstract    :
              The relationships between chemistry and art provide for an                     
              exciting course that will stimulate interest and learning among                
              humanities, social science, and science concentrators.                         
              Laboratory experiments illustrating the chemical principles                    
              involved in the artist's use of materials and the analysis of                  
              those materials will be integral to the course.  Experimental                  
              design will require careful research and development to insure                 
              appropriateness and effectiveness.  Topics for exploration in                  
              this laboratory-oriented course will illustrate the features,                  
              trends, and regions of the Periodic Table, introduce students                  
              to modern laboratory instrumentation, and reveal the concepts                  
              and categories that physical scientists use to understand light                
              and matter.
