Abstract    :
                   This is for a second year of our ACCESS program, the                      
              purpose of which is to establish a pipeline starting in the local high         
              schools which will conduct qualified young women into careers in               
              the physical sciences.  The technique is to select highly motivated            
              participants in their first collegiate year, and after 15 months of            
              special instruction and training, place them as active participants in         
              selected research projects.  In addition, each year three high school          
              teachers are selected to participate in the summer course and                  
              laboratory rotations.  At the end of each summer, these teachers               
              organize (with supervision) workshops for 20 other secondary school            
              teachers on methods of teaching from (rather than to) problems, and            
              strategies to neutralize cultural gender bias.  During their                   
              sophomore year, the students work in selected laboratories and                 
              participate in a weekly seminar organized by the Utah Math/Science             
              Network (this is an organization of women in scientific professions            
              dedicated to encouraging young women in science and mathematics).              
              The Director of the University's Undergraduate Research                        
              Opportunities Program matches the students to research projects.               
              A full-time graduate assistant acts as liaison between the                     
              participants and the faculty.
