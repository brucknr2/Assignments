Abstract    :
              This project is developing an introductory physics laboratory                  
              program centered around the use of microcomputer tools for the                 
              collection, display, and analysis of scientific data.  The                     
              computer tools are used for both qualitative and quantitative                  
              observations of physical phenomena.  Laboratory activities are                 
              from curricular materials already developed and classroom                      
              tested for the Workshop Physics Project at Dickinson College                   
              and the Tools for Scientific Thinking Project at Tufts                         
              University.  This allows laboratory instructors at colleges and                
              universities to share in the educational benefits of these                     
              established educational programs through three quarters or two                 
              semesters of introductory physics without changing the                         
              structure of their introductory programs significantly.                        
              Student Laboratory Activity Guides are being created for three                 
              sets of topics: (1) Mechanics, (2) Thermodynamics, and (3)                     
              Circuits.
