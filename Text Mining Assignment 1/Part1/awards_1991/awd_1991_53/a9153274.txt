Abstract    :
              Faculty from a consortium of diverse institutions are adapting,                
              refining, and implementing approaches to teaching calculus that                
              were developed at Duke University and by the Core Calculus                     
              Consortium, headed by Harvard University.  The first year involves             
              training a select group of about twenty faculty in the new methods.            
              This core of faculty trains faculty from twelve additional                     
              institutions in the second year and all those involved adapt and               
              implement one of the new approaches at their home institution.
