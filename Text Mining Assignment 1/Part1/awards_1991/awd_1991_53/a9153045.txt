Abstract    :
              The College of Science at the California State Polytechnic                     
              University, Pomona, is setting up a networked student                          
              laboratory of eight VAX stations plus a file server in order to                
              support new offerings in computational chemistry, computational                
              physics, and a possible new major in computational science.                    
              This network is clustered with the current Faculty                             
              Computational Science Laboratory so that devices such as array                 
              processors are shared.  A secondary benefit of the project is                  
              the fostering of student research, particularly in                             
              computational chemistry, and an increased capability in                        
              graphics and scientific visualization.NSF grant funds are being                
              matched with funds from non-federal sources.
