Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  COSMIC VOYAGE will be the first film in IMAX to survey                    
              the whole universe.  Its main objective is to convey to a                      
              broad museum audience the enormous range of space and time                     
              scales spanned by the universe, and to locate our familiar                     
              human place in this context.  The film's centerpiece will be                   
              a continuous "cosmic zoom" extending from the largest                          
              observable structure of the universe down to the subnuclear                    
              realm, a guided tour across some 42 orders of magnitude.                       
              This will be followed by a similar excursion through the                       
              dimension of time, from the first instant of the Big Bang to                   
              the present day some 15 billion years later.  The film will                    
              take special care to explain the utility and importance of                     
              "orders of magnitude".  It will indicate the observational                     
              basis underlying our description of the physical world.  The                   
              narrative will emphasize the continuity as well as the open-                   
              ended nature of the scientific enterprise over a wide range                    
              of disciplines (cosmology, high-energy physics, astronomy,                     
              geology, chemistry and biology), and it will integrate the                     
              whole into a coherent picture of the universe.  COSMIC                         
              VOYAGE will communicate this material in ways that are                         
              scientifically accurate and instructive, as well as visually                   
              absorbing and entertaining.  The overall aim is to produce                     
              an unparalleled film about the universe that is both                           
              beautiful and powerful.
