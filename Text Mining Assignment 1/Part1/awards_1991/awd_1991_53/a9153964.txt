Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Franklin Institute Science Museum in Philadelphia, PA., acting             
              as administrative coordinator for the Issues Laboratory                        
              Collaborative (ILC), requests NSF support for five science museums             
              over a three year period to investigate the effectiveness of                   
              museum-based programs about controversial issues in science and                
              technology; to develop, test, refine, and disseminate ten                      
              educational programs on science issues; and to establish a                     
              permanent Science Issues Network that will disseminate materials               
              and methods to all U.S. science museums engaged in issues programs.            
              This project has been formulated for re-submission to the National             
              Science Foundation with guidance from a distinguished panel of                 
              scientists who will assist in program development.  Approximately              
              two million people will be directly served by ILC programs and                 
              exhibits during the three-year period.
