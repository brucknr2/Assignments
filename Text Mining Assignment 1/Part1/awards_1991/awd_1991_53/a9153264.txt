Abstract    :
              Four HBCUs are working together to revise their calculus                       
              curriculum.  A problem solving approach is being implemented                   
              that encourages experimentation and enhances the study of                      
              calculus by minority students.  The primary technical tool is                  
              the microcomputer running the computer algebra system Derive.
