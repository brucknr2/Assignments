Abstract    :
              This project is to develop a computer laboratory which serves                  
              the needs (solely) of freshman engineering students in a                       
              sequence of required courses. Freshman engineering students                    
              utilize this laboratory to acquire an initial experience with                  
              the use of basic computer tools. In particular, the students                   
              obtain experience with computer hardware and software that has                 
              been standardized for use throughout the undergraduate                         
              curriculum.
