Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Somerset County Business/Education Partnership, formed in                  
              1988 by senior business executives and school superintendents                  
              to define goals and create an ongoing relationship, has                        
              requested support to (a) develop consumer-relevant                             
              instructional packages for K-12 grades and (b) provide teacher                 
              training for the implementation and dissemination of the                       
              packages.  In this 36 month project, industry scientists and                   
              interested teachers, working in paired teams, will develop                     
              lessons drawing upon the scientists' expertise for identifying                 
              potential topics and the teachers' for creating appropriate                    
              instructional packages.  While only 15 plans are envisioned                    
              for each of the project's years, each package will be adapted                  
              for a different age group, thereby leading to the production                   
              of approximately 90 different units over the life of the                       
              project.  A one-week training workshop will be held in June                    
              each year for 30 teachers and participating teachers will be                   
              expected to participate in two post-training sessions to                       
              evaluate their experiences using the newly developed                           
              materials.  While the initial request for support of the                       
              Foundation did not include provision for significant                           
              evaluation of student performance, that was added to the                       
              project in the course of negotiations.  The Foundation's                       
              support represents approximately 48% of the total project                      
              costs.
