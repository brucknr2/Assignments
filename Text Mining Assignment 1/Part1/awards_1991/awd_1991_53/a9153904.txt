Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This five year project, sponsored by Grand Valley State                        
              University, provides support each year for 20 teacher                          
              interns to work in local businesses and industry in science                    
              and technology positions.  Based upon this experience the                      
              teachers are expected to design mathematics and science                        
              activities for their students which reflect the themes of                      
              (1) relevant science, mathematics and technology,                              
              (2) problem solving, (3) teamwork, (4) communication and                       
              (5) motivation and quality.  The teacher interns will also                     
              team up with administrators from their school system to                        
              explore these same five themes in regular industry training                    
              sessions at industry sites.  Drawing upon this experience                      
              the teacher/administrator teams will design appropriate                        
              inservice activities for other educators in their own                          
              school.  The teachers are expected to carryout outreach                        
              activities and recruit their colleagues to the project.                        
              These workshops will be run jointly by teacher interns and                     
              their industry partners and will introduce educators to the                    
              world of industry through the eyes of industrial science                       
              and math professionals and the experience of teachers who                      
              have participated in summer internships.                                       
                                                                                             
              NSF funds are being matched by funds from the University,                      
              local schools and local business and industry.  The amount                     
              of matching funds exceeds 124% of the NSF grant.
