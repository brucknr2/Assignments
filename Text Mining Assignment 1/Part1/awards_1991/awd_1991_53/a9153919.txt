Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Triangle Coalition for Science and Technology Education has                
              requested support for a two-year project to expand a pilot                     
              project designed in 1988 into a systematic and replicable                      
              mechanism nationally that advances institutional change locally                
              through a collaboratively planned and implemented volunteer                    
              program in science, mathematics, and technology.  They propose a               
              two-stage expansion:  Phase I involving 20 - 30 project sites,                 
              perfecting pilot training procedures and materials.  Phase II                  
              involving an additional 100 sites using the procedures and                     
              materials developed in Phase I.  The Foundation's support                      
              represent less than 10% of the anticipated project costs, with                 
              the private sector contributions estimated to be on the order of               
              several million dollars.
