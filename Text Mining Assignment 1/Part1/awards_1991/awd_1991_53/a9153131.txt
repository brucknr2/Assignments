Abstract    :
              The Department of Meteorology is purchasing an infrared                        
              thermometer and a radiosonde system for use by undergraduates                  
              at both the beginning and advanced levels. The equipment is                    
              used to ascertain the thermal structure of the lower                           
              atmosphere. By plotting the temperature, humidity and pressure                 
              data, gathered during the ascent of balloon carried sensors,                   
              students obtain a real-time picture of the vertical temperature                
              and humidity distribution of the atmosphere from which they                    
              determine the stability of the air, the height of clouds, the                  
              condensation
