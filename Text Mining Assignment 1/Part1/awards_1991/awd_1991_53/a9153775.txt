Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The University of Michigan seeks funds for a three-year                        
              program to enhance 60 high school mathematics teachers by                      
              strengthening their understanding of mathematical concepts                     
              and effective pedagogy and by applying this knowledge and                      
              skill in a tutorial program for college-bound students in                      
              need of remediation in mathematics.  Both participants and                     
              the college-bound tutees will be selected from among urban-                    
              based schools with large numbers of underrepresented and                       
              underachieving students in mathematics.  Each year, twenty                     
              teachers will participate in a four-week summer workshop and                   
              academic year follow-up activities.  Topics to be addressed                    
              include statistics, computer usage, graphing, interrelating                    
              mathematical concepts, cooperative learning, and motivating                    
              students.  The teachers will participate in videotape                          
              demonstrations of classroom techniques which will become                       
              part of a multimedia documentation of the program which can                    
              be used to replicate the enhancement model elsewhere.                          
                                                                                             
              University of Michigan and local schools' contribution                         
              accounts for 7% of the NSF budget.  With careful                               
              documentation of the project, we can be informed about                         
              successful teacher enhancement for teachers in urban-based                     
              schools with large numbers of underrepresented and                             
              underachieving students of mathematics.
