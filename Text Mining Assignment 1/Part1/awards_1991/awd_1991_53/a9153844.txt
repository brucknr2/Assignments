Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This two-year summer program, sponsored by the University                      
              of Northern Colorado, meets five weeks each summer to teach                    
              40 pre-high school teachers (grades 6-8) chemistry                             
              fundamentals.  The teachers are selected from a national                       
              pool of applicants.  The program features:  (1) chemistry                      
              content presentations and discussions, (2) laboratory                          
              activities, (3) laboratory safety sessions, (4) teaching                       
              sessions and (5) planning sessions on outreach activities.                     
              The content of the program will emphasize the core topics                      
              common to most middle school curricula, development of                         
              pedagogical techniques and the treatment of misconceptions.                    
              Emphasis will also be placed on learning about the                             
              relationship of chemistry to technology and the other                          
              sciences.  Participants will also be able to work with                         
              middle school children enrolled in the summer Chemistry                        
              camp held at the University of Northern Colorado at the                        
              same time as the project.  At the end of the program a                         
              collection of exemplary workshop teaching materials for                        
              pre-high school teachers will be prepared and disseminated.                    
              The ICE national center will support the project through                       
              publicity, evaluation of the program and preparation of the                    
              teaching materials.  The NSF grant is being matched by                         
              institutional funds and ICE funds in the amount of more                        
              than 13%.
