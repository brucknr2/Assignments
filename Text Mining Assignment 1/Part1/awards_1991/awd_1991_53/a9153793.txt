Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This three year project is development of professional                         
              materials for teachers of mathematics. Building on experience                  
              in an earlier teacher enhancement project that focused on                      
              mathematical communication as a support to learning, this                      
              effort will develop and pilot a long-term teacher enhancement                  
              model for the improvement of mathematics education for                         
              elementary school teachers. In particular, they will develop,                  
              implement, and pilot a package of print and video materials                    
              for professional development, to be used by "explorer"                         
              teachers in small inservice group settings. Teachers who have                  
              been working with the PIs in a previous related project will                   
              be involved in the development; the materials will be pilot                    
              tested with teachers in Boston and Chelsea public schools.                     
                                                                                             
              Cost sharing is provided by school districts and TERC as 19%                   
              of the NSF award.
