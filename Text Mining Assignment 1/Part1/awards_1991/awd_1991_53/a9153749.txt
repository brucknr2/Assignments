              This project provides for a series of workshops for high                       
              school teachers during the XII Biennial Conference on                          
              Chemical Education of the Division of Chemical Education of                    
              the American Chemical Society.  The conference will be held                    
              in the summer of 1992, in Davis, California.  In addition to

              program for the participants will be provided.  The workshops                  
              will cover the topics:  (a) the use of computers in the                        
              classroom, (b) employing demonstrations, (c) using consumer                    
              chemicals and supplies and (d) techniques of microchemistry.                   
              In the follow-up sessions prior participants will be asked to                  
              bring at least one of their colleagues so that more teachers                   
              will be involved.  Altogether 150 teachers will be supported                   
              by the project.  The NSF funds are being matched by funds                      
              from the American Chemical Society, the Council of Chemical                    
              Research and private industry.  The matching funds amount to                   
              about 36% of the NSF grant.
