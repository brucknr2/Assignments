Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Minuteman Regional Technical School District proposed a two (2)                
              year project to develop a pilot manufacturing facility with                    
              attention to automated electronic systems used by high technology              
              manufacturers.  The facility would be managed and operated by                  
              student teams, under the supervision of Minuteman faculty, learning            
              how to run a small business, how to control work flow and maintain             
              quality, and how to handle technical problems.  This facility would            
              link traditional academic instruction with practical, hands-on                 
              experience within the environment of a technical high school.  In              
              the course of negotiation, the project was extended to four (4)                
              years with modest increase in Foundation funding, but with                     
              significant increases in the contributions of the partnership to               
              the project.
