Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project is continuing to develop and implement a                          
              comprehensive cooperative Northwest regional "network" to                      
              address the serious underrepresentation of American Indians in                 
              science and technology.  The eight-state Northwest region                      
              consisting of Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming,                     
              North Dakota, South Dakota and Minnesota, is home of more than                 
              300,000 American Indians and 18 of the nation's 24 tribally                    
              controlled community colleges.                                                 
                                                                                             
              The regional network consists of a productive, active                          
              partnership between schools, colleges, universities,                           
              communities, parents, state and local agencies, professional                   
              organization, businesses and industries designed to nurture,                   
              motivate and encourage Indian students to consider careers in                  
              science and technology. Each tribal unit is developing a master                
              plan to address the educational needs of American Indians in                   
              science and technology and to integrate their plans into a                     
              long-range regional network master plan.                                       
                                                                                             
              The regional network is focusing on areas of high American                     
              Indian student population (i.e. reservation schools) and key                   
              transition points to facilitate the transfer of students from                  
              middle schools to high schools, from high schools to                           
              colleges/universities and between community colleges and four-                 
              year institutions.                                                             
                                                                                             
              The regional network is developing and maintaining a                           
              comprehensive student data tracking system, conducting periodic                
              evaluations to measure achievements, and seeking additional                    
              sources of funding to sustain and institutionalize successful                  
              program activities.
