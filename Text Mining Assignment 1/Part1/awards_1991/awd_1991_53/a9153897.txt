Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The Science Museum of Minnesota will produce a 38-                        
              minute IMAX/OMNIMAX film on the topic of tropical                              
              rainforests.  The objectives of the film include: To                           
              illustrate the key scientific concepts relating to                             
              rainforest ecology including biological diversity,                             
              biological change and human impact; To expose a wider                          
              audience to ecological thinking than might normally be                         
              exposed through traditional means of science education or                      
              science media; To communicate the complexity of conservation                   
              issues related to the rainforests.  In addition, the film                      
              will portray science as an attractive career, particularly                     
              for minorities and women.  The museum will create an                           
              integrated program of science enrichment materials that will                   
              accompany the film and will be used for both school groups                     
              and general audiences.  Linking an education program to an                     
              IMAX/OMNIMAX film is a first for the industry and will                         
              extend the learning potential of the project.  Tropical                        
              Rainforest will be distributed to IMAX/OMNIMAX theaters                        
              located in museums and science technology centers; it has                      
              the potential to be seen by more than 14 million people in                     
              its first four years of distribution.
