Abstract    :
                 The Department of Physics is using laser physics and                        
              spectroscopy to enhance student understanding in optics,                       
              quantum mechanics, and atomic physics.   Experiments in                        
              interference phenomena, use of a spectrum analyzer, the                        
              investigation of longitudinal and transverse laser modes and                   
              absorption laser spectroscopy are being done.
