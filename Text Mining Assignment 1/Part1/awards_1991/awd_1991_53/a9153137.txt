Abstract    :
              This project uses Autocad Release 11 with Advanced Modeling                    
              Extension executed on 80386 DX class computers equipped with                   
              six megabyte RAM, 80387 math coprocessor, 14" VGA 640-480 PIXIL                
              graphics monitor, 80 megabyte hard disk drive, and 33 mhz speed                
              with cache memory.  Input/output is accomplished using a                       
              digitizer / laser jet printer.  These tools are used while                     
              teaching design visualization and design communication.  The                   
              solid model 3-D database allows the introduction of mass                       
              properties analysis into the Engineering Design Graphics                       
              course.  Also, the value of this database in analysis,                         
              manufacturing and construction and design documentation is                     
              discussed and demonstrated.  The Barr-Juricic model of the                     
              modern Engineering Design Graphics course is followed as                       
              outlined in the paper, The Engineering Design Graphics (EDG)                   
              Curriculum Modernization Project: A White Paper Summary,                       
              presented at the NSF Symposium on modernization of the                         
              Engineering Design Graphics Curriculum.
