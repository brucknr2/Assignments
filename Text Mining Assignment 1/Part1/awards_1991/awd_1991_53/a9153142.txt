Abstract    :
              This projects enhances junior and senior-level civil                           
              engineering (Environmental Engineering) laboratory facitities                  
              and provides civil engineering students with an advanced                       
              laboratory experience in environmental quality measurements                    
              through automated or computer-based instrumentation. Combined                  
              with the personal computers currently available through the CAD                
              lab, students in civil engineering are able to integrate their                 
              understanding and knowledge of environmental quality                           
              measurements with the control and automation of modern                         
              engineering facility operations and design.
