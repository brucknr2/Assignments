Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The California Alliance for Minority Participation in the Sciences             
              (CAMP) describes creating a four-regionally coordinated Statewide              
              alliance where the University of California-Irvine will serve as               
              lead institution of the nine University of California campuses and             
              fifty public and private institutions alliance.  The fundamental               
              goal of the proposed alliance is to increase significantly the                 
              number of minority scholars in the biological and physical sciences            
              and related engineering fields at the undergraduate level by                   
              creating undergraduate programs that address the primary barriers              
              to success and retention of minorities in the sciences and                     
              engineering.  The P.I. lists ten supporting activities that he                 
              latter groups into six broad programs which will be implemented                
              into each of the four regional.  The programs are as follows:

              In California, 19,998 undergraduate minorities were enrolled in                
              science and engineering programs (13,071 Hispanic students, 5,796              
              Black students, and 1,121 American Indian students).  CAMP                     
              objective is to award within the State 3,500 B.S. degrees, 500                 
              master's degrees and 150 Ph.D. degrees in the biological and                   
              physical sciences and engineering by the year 2000 to                          
              underrepresented minority students.
