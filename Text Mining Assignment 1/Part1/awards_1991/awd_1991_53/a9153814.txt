Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              San Diego State University Foundation will conduct a five-                     
              year program to enhance 225 mathematics teachers of grades 4                   
              through 8 who teach in schools with large African-American                     
              and Latino enrollments.  Each teacher will participate in                      
              one of four two-year cycles (180 hours) of Saturday                            
              workshops during the academic year, a two-week summer                          
              workshop, and working with students and parents in after                       
              school activities.  Participants will 1) study mathematics                     
              content, research on teaching and learning mathematics, and                    
              methodologies and curricula; 2) participate in an after-                       
              school mathematics laboratory program for children; and 3)                     
              assist in implementing workshops designed to involve parents                   
              in their children's mathematics education.  Mathematical                       
              content will include number, patterns and functions,                           
              algebra, statistics, probability, geometry, and measurement.                   
              The project design also calls for the study of the longer-                     
              term effect of the enhancement.                                                
              San Diego State University's  Cost-sharing accounts for 17%                    
              of the NSF budget.                                                             
                                                                                             
              This proposal is well-conceived and has the potential for                      
              becoming an exemplary model for the enhancement of teachers                    
              working in schools with high African-American and Latino                       
              populations.
