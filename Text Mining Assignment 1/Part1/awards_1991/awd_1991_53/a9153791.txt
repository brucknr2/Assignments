Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              This proposal provides a plan for professional development and                 
              structured opportunities in science to 200 middle school                       
              teachers in four targeted urban communities in the San                         
              Francisco Bay Area. The teachers will be almost exclusively                    
              from districts whose populations are underserved and multi-                    
              ethnic.                                                                        
                                                                                             
              Over a period of three years, teachers will receive training                   
              in inquiry-based physical science through summer institutes                    
              and special sessions during the academic year.  Training will                  
              include an intensive 80-hour summer workshop and special                       
              return sessions, based on successful existing models developed                 
              at the Exploratorium Teacher Institute.  The goal of the                       
              project is to develop a core group of teachers in each of the                  
              four target communities, who have had progressively more                       
              responsible levels of involvement with hands-on science, and                   
              who, with occasional follow-up attention from the Teacher                      
              Institute, will be capable of carrying on a professional                       
              collaboration on their own.                                                    
                                                                                             
              Cost sharing is equivalent to $43% of the NSF award.
