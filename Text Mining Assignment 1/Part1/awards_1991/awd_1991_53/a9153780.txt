Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                 The National Science Resources Center (NSRC) project will                  
              engage educators and scientists in a concerted and sustained                   
              effort to improve the teaching of science in the nation's                      
              elementary schools and increase the access of all students to                  
              effective elementary science instruction.  The National                        
              Elementary Science Leadership Initiative (NESLI) will: (1)                     
              develop a talent pool of educators and scientists who can lead                 
              reform efforts in their communities; (2) provide technical                     
              assistance to school districts throughout the country that are                 
              working to improve their elementary science teaching                           
              resources; and (4) stimulate policy and program changes in                     
              school districts that will lead to the introduction of high-                   
              quality hands-on elementary science programs in school                         
              districts across the nation.  The key to the attainment of                     
              these goals is the development of informed leadership and the                  
              identification of national resources that can be made                          
              available to respond to local needs.  The NESLI project plan                   
              is based on research findings concerning the content and                       
              organization of effective elementary school science                            
              instruction; theories of organizational change; an                             
              understanding of the context in which organizational change                    
              must occur in the schools; and five years of NSRC experience                   
              working with hundreds of teachers, scientists, science                         
              educators, and school system administrators to bring about                     
              reforms in elementary school science education.                                
                                                                                             
              The cost sharing for the project will be sixty-four percent of                 
              the NSF portion.
