Abstract    :
              A two-year project is under way to adapt and disseminate the                   
              Calculus in Context curriculum being taught at Hampshire, Mount                
              Holyoke, and Smith Colleges.  The group of mathematicians with                 
              experience with this curriculum is being substantially expanded                
              through intensive workshops and materials are being prepared                   
              that will allow instructors in high schools, two-year colleges                 
              and four-year colleges and universities teach the course                       
              without special training.  Evaluation of the efficacy of the                   
              approach and of the dissemination efforts are part of the                      
              project.
