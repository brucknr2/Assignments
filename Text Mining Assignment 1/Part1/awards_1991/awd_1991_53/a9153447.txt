              women in future careers in science and engineering by providing                
              them with enrichment skills, incentives, mentors and role                      
              models upon which to base their career choices.  Twenty-four                   
              minority girls who are in grades 9 and 10 and six high school                  
              teachers are participating in a year-long program which                        
              includes a Saturday program during the school year and a 10-                   
              day summer residence program.  Objectives include interacting                  
              with female scientists and university professors as role                       
              models, raising sights toward higher education, developing a                   
              peer network, and upgrading skills and confidence with
