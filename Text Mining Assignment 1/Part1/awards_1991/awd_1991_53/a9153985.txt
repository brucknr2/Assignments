Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This program will provide funding to employ and train a                        
              total of 61 minority participants, who will enter into one                     
              of three different program categories.  The first category                     
              will be for 11 young professionals - minority individuals                      
              who have both special needs and abilities.  Their needs are                    
              for continued specialized training to facilitate career                        
              advancement and they would, as would the other two classes                     
              of interns, benefit greatly from the establishment of a                        
              support network encompassing other minority individuals                        
              interested in careers in science museums.  They also have                      
              unique abilities, stemming from their prior experience in                      
              science centers or other science-related institutions, that                    
              will allow them to serve as models for participants in the                     
              other two categories in the program.  Their component of the                   
              program will span two full years.  The second program                          
              category is for 10 post-baccalaureate minority individuals                     
              who are just entering the job market and who, with the                         
              proper training and support, are likely to pursue a career                     
              in science museums.  They will participate in an 18 month                      
              program that will provide them with both specific career                       
              skills as well as an overall introduction to careers in the                    
              museum context.  The third program category will provide                       
              half-time internships for two cohorts of 20 minority                           
              individuals who are currently enrolled in college.  Each                       
              cohort will participate.  The total cost of the project is                     
              $2,041,485.00.  The National Science Foundation is asked to                    
              provide $1,051,298.00 and the members of the consortium will                   
              fund $990,187.00.  The cost to the National Science                            
              Foundation, approximately fifty percent of the project cost,                   
              is about $8600.00 per minority participant per year.
