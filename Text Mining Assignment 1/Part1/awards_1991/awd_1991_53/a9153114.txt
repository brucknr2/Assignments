Abstract    :
              Flow Injection Analysis (FIA) involves the injection of a small                
              sample (microliters) into a flowing stream.  The flow path is                  
              defined by modules that permit sample and reagent mixing and                   
              detection by a wide range of techniques.  FIA will be used in                  
              Instrumental Analysis and other courses to illustrate sample                   
              preparation, derivatization or reaction of the analyte, its                    
              detection, and the processing of results.  The required                        
              apparatus is simple, relatively low cost, and can easily be                    
              adapted to demonstrate ion selective electrodes,                               
              spectrophotometry, solvent extraction, dialysis, kinetic                       
              methods including the use of enzymes (soluble and immobilized),                
              and immunoassay.  Because the sample volumes are small, the                    
              reagent requirements are modest and relatively inexpensive.                    
              The grantee will match the NSF contribution to this project.
