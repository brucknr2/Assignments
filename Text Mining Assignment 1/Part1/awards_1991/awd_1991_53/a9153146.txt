Abstract    :
              The Electrical Communications Laboratory facilities at the                     
              University of Texas at San Antonio are being upgraded to extend                
              and cover the traditional as well as new base technologies,                    
              such as fiber optics, satellite communications, high definition                
              television, and digital audio recording.  Three levels of                      
              experimentation are used.  Initially, experiments dealing with                 
              the design of basic building blocks of analog and digital                      
              communications systems are investigated to provide familiarity                 
              with various signal processing techniques used in modern                       
              communications systems, instruction on how to operate                          
              communication laboratory test equipment such as spectrum and                   
              modulation domain analyzers, and exposure to some                              
              hardware/software implementation.  The second level of                         
              experimentation involves small system design in which discrete                 
              or integrated devices are used to build small systems.  Level                  
              three involves experimentation with a complete communications                  
              system such as a fiber optics network or a simulated satellite                 
              link like "MODEM"  which can simulate an entire digital                        
              communications system and provide performance information                      
              similar to laboratory observations.
