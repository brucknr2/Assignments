Abstract    :
              The Chemistry Department is purchasing equipment to increase                   
              the analytical experience in lower division courses. The                       
              students are using capillary column gas chromatography (gc) in                 
              the freshman year to study intermolecular forces, analyze                      
              environmental samples and to study reaction mechanisms.                        
              Personal computers are being used to introduce high-field                      
              Fourier transform nuclear magnetic resonance (ft-nmr)                          
              spectroscopy to students in the second year of the chemistry                   
              core curriculum. Students receive fid files for their unknown                  
              samples which they use to transform, phases, integrate and                     
              finally plot the spectra.
