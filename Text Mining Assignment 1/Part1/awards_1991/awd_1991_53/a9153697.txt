Abstract    :
              In 1988, a major five-year program known as E4 and entitled "An                
              Enhanced Educational Experience for Engineering Students" was                  
              launched by Drexel University and the National Science                         
              Foundation.  This program focuses on the revision of the lower                 
              division engineering curriculum, and includes the Introductory                 
              Engineering Laboratory (IEL).  This project uses the IEL as a                  
              physical and intellectual foundation to develop a new Advanced                 
              Engineering Laboratory (AEL).  The AEL is integrated with the                  
              IEL with respect to philosophy, perspective, organization,                     
              program, and equipment.  The objectives are 1) to capitalize on                
              developed student skills while focusing on sophisticated                       
              specialized or interdisciplinary experiments; 2) to enhance the                
              scope, efficiency and effectiveness of existing upper-division                 
              laboratories; 3) to develop new experimental configurations;                   
              and 4) to serve as a model facility and strategy for providing                 
              a diverse, sophisticated and cost-effective environment for                    
              teaching the theory and practice of modern engineering                         
              experimentation.  This phase of the project addresses the                      
              analysis, design, and prototype development and testing of the                 
              AEL.
