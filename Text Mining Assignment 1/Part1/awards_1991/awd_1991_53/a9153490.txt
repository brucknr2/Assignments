Abstract    :
                   The objective of this project is to increase access to                    
              engineering careers for women students.  About 25 women high                   
              school graduates between the ages of 25 and 45, who are                        
              employed in jobs below their potential capabilities, are                       
              enrolled in engineering programs at the University of Tennessee                
              Chattanooga on a part-time basis.  Their employers are partners                
              in the project and provide opportunities for employees to                      
              observe science, engineering and technically related                           
              activities.  The women are enrolled at the University in a                     
              seminar for beginning engineering students and participate in                  
              enrichment activities which emphasize academic involvement,                    
              careers, professionalism, communications, social interaction                   
              and motivation.  At the end of this period, students who have                  
              demonstrated aptitude will be encouraged to enroll in                          
              engineering curricula structured for part-time students.  This                 
              project gives women students a sense of community and                          
              involvement in engineering-related activities.
