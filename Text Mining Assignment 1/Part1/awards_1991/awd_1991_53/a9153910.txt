              improve problem solving and communication skills in 7th                        
              through 9th grade students and (b) to improve the skills of                    
              preservice and inservice teachers in integrating technology                    
              into the curriculum. Activities intended to lead to the                        
              realization of these goals include:  (a) development of                        
              microcomputer based laboratory and teleconferencing in 10 area

              schools sites; (d) a conference to develop and implement an                    
              action plan for the improvement of science instruction at all
