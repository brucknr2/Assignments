Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to enable students in the                          
              physiology laboratory to study the temporal patterning of                      
              extracellularly recorded neuronal activity.  This is to be                     
              accomplished through the use of a high speed 12 bit analog to                  
              digital conversion board and complementary display and                         
              analytical software.  Processing would be handled by a 386 SX                  
              computer and high resolution hard copy would be obtained with                  
              a laser printer.Specific applications include recording                        
              patterns of activity in cockroach leg sensory axons in response                
              to mechanical stimulation of leg spines and changes in                         
              cockroach ventral nerve cord activity in response to cercal                    
              nerve stimulation.  The software will enable isolation of                      
              single units through window (amplitude) discrimination and                     
              waveshape recognition as well as analysis of action potential                  
              frequencies.      These capabilities are expected to                           
              significantly enhance students' understanding of neuronal                      
              coding by allowing them to collect and quantitatively analyze                  
              temporal patterning over longer periods of time than would be                  
              the case when using a digital storage oscilloscope.
