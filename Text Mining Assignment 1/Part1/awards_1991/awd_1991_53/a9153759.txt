Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The aim of this proposal is to use project-based science as                    
              a vehicle to improve science teaching and learning so that                     
              students will become more knowledgeable, thoughtful, and                       
              motivated to learn science.  The staff of the project will                     
              work collaboratively with upper elementary and middle                          
              school teachers to meld the theoretical and research based                     
              knowledge of university faculty with the professional                          
              teaching knowledge of teachers.  Because of an interest in                     
              the problems and potential of project-based science for                        
              different types of students, half of the participating                         
              teachers will be drawn from schools which service a                            
              substantial number of low-income, minority, and high risk                      
              groups.  The project will result in the development and                        
              dissemination of a variety of enhancement materials for                        
              teachers who want to use project-based science instruction.                    
              These support materials will be based on the detailed                          
              accounts of problems that teachers face and the solutions                      
              they devise as they implement project-based science.  They                     
              will include central components of successful project                          
              design and implementation such as illustrations of key                         
              events like introducing the project and instructional                          
              strategies in the life cycle of a project.  The materials                      
              will be expressed through a range of media from written                        
              documents to a computer-based hypermedia project support                       
              environment that will allow the teachers to search and use                     
              information to implement, modify and generate projects.
