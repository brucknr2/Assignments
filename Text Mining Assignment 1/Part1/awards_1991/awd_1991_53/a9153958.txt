Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The University of Illinois will carry out the project,                         
              "Teacher Preparation Archives: Case Studies of NSF-funded                      
              Middle School Math and Science Teacher Preparation                             
              Projects."  The project will analyze and evaluate the nine                     
              middle-school teacher preparation projects funded through a                    
              program solicitation in 1985-86 and will archive                               
              information and materials from these projects.  Each middle                    
              school project will be visited by a researcher who will                        
              carry out an in-depth study of the project, collect and                        
              archive materials from the project, and prepare a case-                        
              study report describing the site.  A set of common issues                      
              and questions will be examined across all sites, and                           
              researchers will be encouraged to pursue additional topics                     
              specific to each site.  Researchers will explore the                           
              development of each project, its successes and                                 
              accomplishments, and the difficulties experienced and                          
              lessons learned.  A repository will be established to                          
              archive the collected materials from all the sites, and the                    
              site visit reports will be incorporated into a document                        
              which will be widely disseminated to mathematics and                           
              science educators.   This document and archived materials                      
              will provide a mechanism for the middle school projects to                     
              influence teacher preparation practice throughout the                          
              country.
