Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal is for a planning grant that is the first step in                
              the development, implementation, and evaluation of material for                
              middle school mathematics.  It is anticipated that a full                      
              proposal will be submitted to Instructional Material Development               
              at the end of this project.                                                    
                                                                                             
              The PI proposes to become involved in the efforts of successful                
              programs in curriculum development, to study the materials                     
              available, and to make contacts with other mathematics educators               
              by means of NCTM and other professional meetings.//
