Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              This proposal develops an on-going structure for private                       
              sector scientists and engineers to work cooperatively with                     
              teachers to improve math/science instruction. Partners will be                 
              a joint effort by the private sector, the Los Angeles                          
              Educational Partnership, the Los Angeles Unified School                        
              District, and local universities.                                              
                                                                                             
              The project activities will occur primarily in elementary and                  
              middle schools. During the three years of project                              
              implementation, partners will work directly in the classroom                   
              with 50 teachers and their students to increase the quality                    
              and quantity of inquiry based instruction, and gear that                       
              instruction to the experimental, cultural, and language                        
              backgrounds of the children.
