Abstract    :
              The Digital Systems Design Laboratory is a project oriented                    
              course that introduces combinational, synchronous sequential                   
              and asynchronous sequential circuit design to majors in the                    
              Electronics and Computer Engineering Technology programs at the                
              University of Arkansas Little Rock.  In these projects, the                    
              students are required to minimize boolean functions and verify                 
              their design by hard-wiring the circuit.  This project upgrades                
              the present laboratory facility to design circuits using                       
              programmable logic devices and also allow programming of these                 
              devices.  This approach will augment the existing traditional                  
              gate and small scale device realization of logic functions.                    
              These programmed devices are used to test the larger design                    
              problems.  Ten computer workstations with programmable logic                   
              device software and hardware peripherals are used by the                       
              students in the laboratory.
