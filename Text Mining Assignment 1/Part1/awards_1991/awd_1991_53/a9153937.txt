Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Davis County Private Industry Council proposes a four (4)                  
              year project to improve science and mathematics instruction and                
              learning through: (a) involving 80 low income at-risk youth in                 
              personally meaningful math/science experiences which will help                 
              them overcome their basic skill deficiencies; (b) providing                    
              private sector employment opportunities for 80 math and science                
              school teachers; (c) increasing process skills of 54,000 students              
              in the Davis School District; (d) involving 250 K-9 math and                   
              science teachers in curriculum development and instructional                   
              material usage.  Included in the project plan is participation by              
              private sector scientists who will teach technical topics in                   
              local schools, demonstrate real world science applications to                  
              students and teachers, and provide information on career                       
              opportunities.  The Foundation's commitment is approximately 32%               
              of the total project cost.
