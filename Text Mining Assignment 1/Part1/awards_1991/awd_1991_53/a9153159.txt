Abstract    :
                   A year-long biochemistry laboratory course will be                        
              developed for the ACS-certified degree in                                      
              Chemistry/Biochemistry.  The laboratory will focus on                          
              centrifugation, chromatography, electrophoresis, and                           
              spectroscopy in the separation, identification, analysis, and                  
              chemistry of biomolecules.  The equipment to be acquired and                   
              used hands-on by the students includes refrigerated                            
              centrifuges, uv-vis spectrophotometers and fluorometers, a                     
              capillary electrophoresis system, and an HPLC system.  The                     
              grantee will overmatch the NSF grant with $98,403 of non-                      
              Federal funds.
