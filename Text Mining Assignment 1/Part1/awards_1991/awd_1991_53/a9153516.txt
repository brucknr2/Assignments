Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Minorities are significantly underrepresented in science and                   
              engineering fields in the United States.  To attract and retain                
              capable minority students requires the development of programs                 
              which motivate and encourage them toward science and                           
              engineering.  This project is designed to involve students in                  
              hands-on research activities in the NAPI (Navajo Agricultural                  
              Product Industry) under the guidance of professionals.                         
                                                                                             
              The project has the following distinctive objectives:                          
                                                                                             
                   Increasing the understanding and effectiveness of                         
                   problem-solving, information processing and                               
                   decision-making analysis related to water, land,                          
                   human resources and environmental protection for                          
                   irrigated agricultural systems.                                           
                                                                                             
                   Training and encouraging Native American, Hispanic                        
                   and other minority students, as well as women, to                         
                   complete graduate work and pursue engineering and                         
                   agricultural economic careers in the development and                      
                   application of technology to improve resource                             
                   management.                                                               
                                                                                             
                   Implementing a teamwork learning environment that
