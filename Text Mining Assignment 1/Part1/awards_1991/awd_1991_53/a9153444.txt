Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Wentworth Institute of Technology (WIT), in collaboration with                 
              the Boston Housing Authority (BHA-Public Safety Division),                     
              Federated Dorchester Neighborhood Association, and the eastern                 
              zone Boston pubic elementary schools is developing a model                     
              program, the Summer/Winter Camp in Applied Technology.  The                    
              purpose of the program is to stimulate the curiosity and                       
              interest of elementary school age (grade 3 and 4) minority                     
              students in mathematics, science and technology.  Studies have                 
              shown that the time to influence young people's career choices                 
              is in elementary school.  WIT is conducting a program that                     
              demonstrates the practical application of mathematics and                      
              science by clarifying the part these subjects play in preparing                
              for careers in applied technology.   The camp curriculum                       
              encourages hand-on participation through laboratory projects                   
              in manufacturing technology, computer science, mechanical                      
              engineering and civil engineering/building construction.  The                  
              underlying theme of the camp curriculum is how things break,                   
              how things work, how things are built , and how people solve                   
              problems.  The curriculum is based on the mathematics and                      
              science objectives of the targeted school district.  The                       
              technical components of the camp are balanced by a sports                      
              program that enables students to learn about the importance of                 
              good health, positive release of stress and team efforts.  The                 
              pilot for this program was held during July 1991, and was                      
              funded by the Massachusetts Board of Regents under the                         
              Eisenhower Program as well as the Alfred P. Sloane Foundation                  
              and local Boston industry.//
