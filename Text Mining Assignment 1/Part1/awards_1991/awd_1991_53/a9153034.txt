Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry is acquiring a 300 Mhz Fourier                     
              transform nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer. The                         
              spectrometer is being integrated into the curriculum beginning                 
              with hands-on training in 1H and 13C NMR techniques in the                     
              sophomore Organic Chemistry course. Students in nine other                     
              required courses are expanding upon these techniques in multi-                 
              dimensional experiments. Extensive use of the instrument is                    
              also being made by undergraduate students engaging in research                 
              projects on, for example, polysaccharides, synthesis of                        
              compactin lactones, organometallic compounds and, histone                      
              proteins.
