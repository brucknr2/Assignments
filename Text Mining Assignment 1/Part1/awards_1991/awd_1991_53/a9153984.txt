Abstract    :
                This proposal, submitted by California State University,                     
              Hayward, and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, is to                     
              establish a program that will increase the retention rate of                   
              underrepresented minority college students majoring in                         
              physics.  It will also increase the number of these same                       
              students who will ultimately receive doctoral degrees in                       
              physics and thereby expand their numbers in the workforce and                  
              professional physicists.  This proposed program will achieve                   
              the following goals:                                                           
                                                                                             
                 1)   Increase and retain underrepresented minority (Black,                  
                      Hispanic and Native American) students in physics                      
                      through their B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees.                           
                                                                                             
                 2)   Increase number of underrepresented minority students                  
                      exposed to physics research at a national laboratory.                  
                                                                                             
                 3)   Provide scientists to serve as role models with                        
                      similar cultural backgrounds to mentor these students.                 
                                                                                             
                 4)   Establish and formalize national organizations of                      
                      underrepresented minority students; e.g., Black,                       
                      Hispanic, Native American.
