Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              ASM International and the ASM Foundation for Education and                     
              Research have requested support for a three-year project to                    
              assist 20 local chapters of the ASM International in forming                   
              long-term partnerships with their local schools and/or school                  
              districts.  They propose using a "process model" which is                      
              based on the experience of a pilot project involving a group                   
              of seven (7) chapters in forming such relationships.  That                     
              model is described in terms of three key elements and will                     
              entail the conduct of a series of workshops, offered to a                      
              progressively smaller number of invitees who have successfully                 
              negotiated the prior element, designed to shepherd at least 20                 
              local chapters through the final stages in the establishment                   
              of durable partnerships.  Foundation support is approximately                  
              10% of the total project cost which includes not only that of                  
              the immediate partnership but also that anticipated as a                       
              commitment by the local chapters of scientist time and                         
              materials.
