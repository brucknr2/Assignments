Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal provides a plan for the creation of a model to                   
              improve the quality and effectiveness of science education in                  
              multicultural settings.                                                        
                                                                                             
              Over a period of three years, a core of master teachers will                   
              be trained in the use of integrated science curriculum.  These                 
              master teachers will then train 100 of their less well-                        
              prepared peers to use the new curricula.  The target group is                  
              minority and female students.  In the process, the 100                         
              teachers will learn the content, teaching methods and                          
              interpersonal skills that the master teachers have found to be                 
              effective in increasing the engagement of minority and female                  
              students with science learning.                                                
                                                                                             
              Cost sharing is equivalent to 17% of the NSF award.
