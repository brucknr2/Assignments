Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to integrate scientific                       
              visualization tools into key engineering laboratory and lecture                
              courses.  The goal is for students to attain an improved                       
              physical understanding of the fundamental principles taught in                 
              undergraduate engineering courses through a visual                             
              representation of relevant principles, whether in the field of                 
              fluid mechanics, thermal sciences, structures, etc.  The                       
              program is implemented in sophomore courses where students                     
              perform simple image processing on canned images to acquaint                   
              themselves with the capabilities of scientific visualization;                  
              in upper division courses where image processing assignments                   
              complement in-class discussion of difficult engineering                        
              concepts; and in senior laboratory courses where students                      
              capture, digitize, and analyze images of physical phenomena in                 
              a laboratory environment.
