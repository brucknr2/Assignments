Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This four year teacher enhancement program, sponsored by                       
              Occidental College, provides two two-week summer workshops for                 
              15 teachers in chemistry and 15 teachers in biology each                       
              summer.  The workshops will provide training in discipline                     
              concepts and the use and development of laboratories employing                 
              modern instruments.  The summer program will be followed up by                 
              an academic year program which includes a highly trained lead                  
              teacher who visits each school once a month.  The teacher                      
              brings with him/her a van equipped with the instruments used                   
              by the teachers the previous summer.  Other follow up                          
              activities include development of a network among the                          
              participants, a seminar series, a research associates program                  
              (teachers will be selected to carryout research with college                   
              faculty), a science information clearing house and a "best                     
              experiment competition".  The target schools enroll a large                    
              number of minority students.  The project evaluation will look                 
              at whether a technology focussed laboratory program increases                  
              the number of students interested in pursuing science.                         
                                                                                             
              Matching funds from Occidental College are equivalent to about                 
              32% of the NSF grant.
