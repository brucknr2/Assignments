              The Resource Center for Science and Engineering of the                         
              University of Puerto Rico has formed a consortium with the                     
              major universities and systemic research projects on the island                
              including the CRCM, EPSCOR, and MRCE, and through the Mendez                   
              foundation Project Causa.                                                      
                                                                                             
              The Alliance will focus on the following foci:                                 
                                                                                             
              1.   expansion and strengthening of college transition                         
                   programs,                                                                 
              2.   major curriculum assessment and development, and                          
              3.   the expansion of graduate programs.                                       
                                                                                             
              The major thrust of the PR-AMP will be to transform, in a                      
              fundamental way, science and engineering education through the                 
              undergraduate curriculum.  Specific quantitative and                           
              qualitative indicators of the project's impact will be put in                  
              place in order to disseminate the Project's results.
