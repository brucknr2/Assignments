Abstract    :
              The Calculus & Mathematica course initiated at the University                  
              of Illinois and further developed at Ohio State is being                       
              extended to second year calculus.  The focus is on development                 
              of materials, testing them in the class room, and revising them                
              in light of the experience gained.  Student outcomes are being                 
              assessed and the results will be reported to the  community.
