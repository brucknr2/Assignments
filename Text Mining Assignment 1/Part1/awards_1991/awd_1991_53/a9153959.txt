Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal is for exploratory small grant funding for the collation         
              and summary of telecommunications-in-education research applicable to          
              the use of large-scale wide-area networks in the science classroom and         
              the prompt dissemination of that information to the facilitators of            
              state and national education networks.                                         
                                                                                             
              The purpose of this project is to facilitate future research in                
              educational telecommunications, and to collate and provide information         
              useful to the initial phases of state-wide and national                        
              telecommunications-in-education networks.  Several states, and several         
              commercial organizations are already offering or are about to offer from       
              September 1991 or September 1992 access to large scale                         
              telecommunications facilities to schools.                                      
                                                                                             
              Though a considerable amount of research has been done on individual           
              small scale networks and on small group components of large-scale              
              networks, this research is neither easily accessible nor wholly relevant       
              to the large-scale situation.  As yet,l we have very little information        
              on the effects of scaling up from the base of research-oriented                
              prototype networks.                                                            
                                                                                             
              Also, the creation of these new telecommunications applications and new        
              network communities in education is taking place extremely quickly.  If        
              these developments are to be constructive advances in teaching and             
              learning strategies it is imperative that these new efforts should be          
              informed by prior experience and research.                                     
                                                                                             
              In order to establish a baseline of relevant information in a timely           
              fashion, it is proposed that NSF should fund a limited research                
              initiative between April 1, 1991 and September 1,l 1991.  The initiative       
              will have three components - the collation of existing research, a             
              demonstration study of an academic network, and a demonstration study of       
              a global-scale K-12 network.
