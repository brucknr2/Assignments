Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This curriculum development project proposal comes from a                      
              partnership comprising the Rocheste City School District, Eastman              
              Kodak Company, Edunetics Corporation, and the University of                    
              Rochester.  Envisioned is a curriculum, assisted by a totally                  
              integrated computer-based delivery system that includes the                    
              following features: (a) current, comprehensive information in                  
              each discipline which can be readily updated electronically; (b)               
              current practical applications of key concepts from basic science              
              and mathematics; (c) flexible sequencing of content matter, with               
              coordinated activities and hands-on materials; (d) remedial and                
              accelerated stands within the instructional program.  All major                
              components will be field tested in both urban and suburban                     
              locations throughout the United States.  The Foundation's support              
              for this 3-year project represents approximately 40% of total                  
              project costs.
