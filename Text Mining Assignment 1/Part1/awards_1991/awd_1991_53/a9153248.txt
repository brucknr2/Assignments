Abstract    :
              Students are working collaboratively on thought-provoking                      
              problems in small teams under the guidance of advanced                         
              undergraduates.  The collection of problems is being expanded                  
              and will include materials for use with graphing calculators                   
              and guide books for the restructured course.
