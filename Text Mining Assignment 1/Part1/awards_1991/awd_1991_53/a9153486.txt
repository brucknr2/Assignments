Abstract    :
                Northern Arizona University has formed an articulation with                  
              seven elementary schools, each with a predominantly minority                   
              student enrollment, that will improve the quality of science                   
              teaching in those schools by developing and supporting teams of                
              teachers, Resource Specialist Teams, in each school to                         
              implement good science programs.  The program is a model that                  
              is providing the following training opportunities for the                      
              Resource Specialist Teams:  (1) enhancement of multicultural                   
              awareness so that teams can incorporate culture-based science                  
              into major concepts and themes in their teaching; (2)                          
              interdisciplinary content enrichment so that teachers can                      
              develop organizing concepts in science using topics from all                   
              disciplines in their teaching; (3) enhanced translation of                     
              teachers' content knowledge into the development of a                          
              constructivist perspective of learning that guides curriculum                  
              development and teaching strategies.  The project staff are                    
              providing  the following support systems to implement the goals                
              and objectives of the training:  (1) development of Resource                   
              Specialist Teams as a model for the utilization of the minority                
              school as the effective unit for improvement of science                        
              education; (2) assistance for the Resource Specialists Teams                   
              with implementation of curriculum, access to resources and                     
              information; and (3) establishment of an effective delivery                    
              system of Teacher Networked Teams throughout the region.
