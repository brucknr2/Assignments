Abstract    :
              This project develops an undergraduate chemical engineering                    
              laboratory program in which a significant part of the program                  
              involves a unifying theme based upon a functioning                             
              process/device rather than upon the thematic classroom                         
              curriculum.  Instead of constructing experiments so that the                   
              data obtained is in agreement with theoretical models developed                
              in lecture classes, a real process/device is studied throught                  
              the laboratory course and forms the basis for unifying and                     
              integrating the classroom material.  Chromatography forms a                    
              suitable basis for such an approach in chemical engineering,                   
              and therefore is used.
