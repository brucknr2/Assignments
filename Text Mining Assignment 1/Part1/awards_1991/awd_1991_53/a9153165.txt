Abstract    :
              Scientific psychology has grown and produced a number of                       
              discrete domains of research.  Although the Psychology                         
              Department offers courses that cover these domains adequately,                 
              there are presently no laboratory sections which accompany any                 
              of its upper-level courses. In response to the growing need to                 
              introduce further experience in empirical, quantitative                        
              analysis of behavior, the Psychology Department is presently                   
              making changes that permit the addition of laboratory courses                  
              that expand on the foundations developed in the lower-level                    
              Experimental Psychology course.  The additional laboratory                     
              courses in learning and Physiological Psychology will allow the                
              Department to better utilize its faculty members and existing                  
              equipment.Laboratories in Learning and Physiological Psychology                
              often involve special techniques that require supportive                       
              equipment and instruments for their methods and procedures.  If                
              this equipment is acquired, it would allow the Department to                   
              satisfy increasing student demand for laboratory experience in                 
              scientific aspects of psychology.
