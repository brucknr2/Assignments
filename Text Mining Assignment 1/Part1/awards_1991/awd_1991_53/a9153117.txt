Abstract    :
              We propose to expand a pilot computer-based facility for                       
              undergraduate social science research.  The Laboratory for the                 
              Social Sciences, established in 1989, is built around an                       
              innovative, menu-driven "expert" system developed at Brandeis.                 
              The Microcomputer Integrated Data Analysis System(MIDAS)                       
              provides novice undergraduates easy access to a massive social-                
              science data archive. The enthusiastic response has confirmed                  
              the power of MIDAS to capture the research imagination of                      
              liberal arts undergraduates, most of whom have not yet taken                   
              statistics courses.  Accordingly, the Sloan Foundation, through                
              its New Liberal Arts Program has awarded Brandeis a $170,000                   
              curriculum development grant to support faculty efforts to                     
              incorporate research projects based on MIDAS throughout the                    
              undergraduate social-science curriculum.  Our small pilot                      
              facility cannot service the rapidly growing demand, thus we are                
              requesting funds to purchase six additional computer work                      
              stations.
