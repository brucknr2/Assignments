Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project is working to instill an interest in mathematics,                 
              science, and engineering careers in Hispanic high school                       
              students and enhance their mathematics and science skills.  One                
              hundred and twenty high school students are participating in                   
              the project activities.  The students, after school, work in                   
              teams studying mathematics and science.  Each student is                       
              assigned two mentors, an engineer and an engineering student.                  
              The mentors serve as role models and resource persons to                       
              provide the students with realistic information about careers                  
              in engineering.  The students and their mentors meet as a group                
              several times during the school year.  The students also visit                 
              and observe their mentors at work,  The project utilizes the                   
              methods and approaches of "El Ingeniero", a career                             
              education/mathematics and science enrichment program which has                 
              been identified as an exemplary program in "Changing America:
