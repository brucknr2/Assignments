Abstract    :
              The materials and the approach to teaching calculus developed at               
              the University of Iowa are being adapted, refined, and implemented             
              throughout the calculus sequence.  A lecture approach is integrated            
              with an interactive computer laboratory component centered around              
              Mathematica Notebooks.   Many of the students are future                       
              mathematics teachers.
