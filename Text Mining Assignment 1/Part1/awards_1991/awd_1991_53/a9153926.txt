Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Navajo Community College has proposed a comprehensive program                  
              aimed at increasing the participation of Native Americans in                   
              science which includes (a) the use of Navajo or other Indian                   
              scientists and engineers as career and personal role models                    
              for youths, (b) summer teacher workshops, (c) comprehensive                    
              evaluation, and (d) a leadership role for the college in                       
              disseminating the fruits of its work to other native American                  
              colleges.  Of particular interest in the project is the active                 
              involvement of Indian scientists from the Lawrence Livermore                   
              and the Los Alamos National Laboratories.  In the final two                    
              years of the project, outreach and dissemination efforts will                  
              include invitational conferences for the contiguous                            
              reservation areas (year 3) and for all like colleges (year 4).                 
              In the course of negotiations the project evolved from a two                   
              (2) year effort to one that spans four (4) years.  The                         
              Foundation is providing approximately 47% of total project                     
              costs.
