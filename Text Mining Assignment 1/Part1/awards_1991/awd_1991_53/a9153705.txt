Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The immediate goal of this two year program is to provide                      
              20 high school science teachers from the New York area with                    
              practical experience in research in modern biology,                            
              biochemistry, cell biology, chemistry, genetics and                            
              molecular biology so that they can transmit to their                           
              students knowledge gained regarding content, scientific                        
              method, and the excitement of scientific research. The                         
              program was created to develop a partnership in science                        
              education between high school science teachers and                             
              University faculty  and to encourage sustained associations                    
              between them. Participants in the program are committed to                     
              working in a Columbia University research laboratory for at                    
              least two consecutive summers. A major premise of the                          
              program is that affiliations of science teachers with                          
              research laboratories and practicing scientists will                           
              provide the teachers with a better appreciation of the                         
              excitement of scientific discovery, the tools and                              
              technologies of modern biology and chemistry, the                              
              trajectory of a scientist's career and the realities of                        
              working as a scientist.                                                        
                                                                                             
              Based on the knowledge and experience gained during the                        
              summer research experience, teachers are expected to plan                      
              and implement a series of activities in their schools                          
              during the following academic years. These activities may                      
              include inservice offerings, implementation of new student                     
              laboratory experiences, new curriculum projects, field                         
              trips to research laboratories, or other appropriate                           
              activities.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              An amount equal to 42.4 % of NSF cost will be provided as                      
              cost share.
