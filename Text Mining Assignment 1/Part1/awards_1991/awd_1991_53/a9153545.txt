Abstract    :
                   The objective of this project is to involve 36 eleven to                  
              fourteen year-old girls and 18 of their teachers from nine                     
              middle schools in New York City in activities designed to                      
              develop and reinforce their interest in science.  These include                
              (a) a three-week Summer Workshop at the Graduate Center of the                 
              City University of New York (CUNY) in which they are developing                
              expertise with computers; (b) ten Saturday Sessions for field                  
              trips to museums, research laboratories and universities; (c)                  
              after school science/mathemtics clubs which meet on a weekly                   
              basis to facilitate networking; and (d) Prep Time for 8th grade                
              students which is preparing them to take the Secondary School                  
              Aptitude Test (SSAT).  This project integrates scientists into                 
              all activities and, thus, provides for continual access to                     
              information and role models.
