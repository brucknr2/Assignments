Abstract    :
              This project takes advantage of using videodisc and optical                    
              disc technologies in order to overcome obstacles inherent in                   
              teaching/learning manufacturing processes and pavement                         
              design/construction courses in civil engineering.  These                       
              technologies are particularly effective for use in teaching                    
              manufacturing processes and related courses since complete                     
              understanding of these subjects cannot be gained without                       
              actually viewing the manufacturing processes.The opticaldisc                   
              recording equipment involved in the project permits control                    
              over the production and updating of optical discs, and the                     
              production of the instructional material on a timely basis and                 
              at a fraction of the cost of having the discs produced                         
              commercially.
