Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Project ATMOSPHERE will over a  five-year period (a)                           
              establish a permanent national network of precollege                           
              Atmospheric Education Resource Agents, (AERAs) (b) produce                     
              scientifically accurate, up-to-date, and pedagogically sound                   
              resource and instructional materials aimed at teachers, and                    
              (c) disseminate and implement these materials.  It is part                     
              of a national program of the American Meteorological Society                   
              designed to encourage teachers, grades 5-9, to use the                         
              atmospheric environment to heighten interest in and                            
              relevancy of science.  An extensive training program                           
              followed by annual renewal sessions will produce a steady-                     
              state network of 70 to 80 AERAs.  With representation in                       
              every state, the network will build on the strengths of                        
              resource agents who come to the project as recognized master                   
              teachers and professional leaders in their home areas.  They                   
              will participate in project materials development and will                     
              play major roles in disseminating information and                              
              implementation activity.                                                       
                                                                                             
              Phase I atmospheric education will be done at National                         
              Weather Service Training Centers (NWSTC) workshops.  Drawing                   
              teachers from these; 60 AERAs will receive Phase II training                   
              in year 1 in this project's 2-week workshop.  In year 2, 3,                    
              4, and 5 60-80 AERAs will receive Phase II and Phase III                       
              training at 2-week workshops.  Workshop sites are Boulder,                     
              CO and Norman, OK in alternative years.  In year 3, 4, and 5                   
              there will be 1-one week follow-up workshops for 55                            
              teachers.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              A minimum of 2 peer-led workshops will be delivered by                         
              increasing numbers of AERAs each year, beginning with 24                       
              teachers in year 1 and increasing to 94 teachers by year 3.                    
                                                                                             
              The teacher enhancement materials to be developed include                      
              200 reference and resource papers on atmospheric environment                   
              topics, annually-published newsletter/information packets,                     
              and 10 self-contained instructional modules.  Dissemination                    
              will range from mailings of materials to the offering of                       
              informational sessions by AERAs.  The instructional                            
              materials will implemented in workshops arranged and                           
              conducted by AERAs.  Approximately 1,000 information and                       
              training sessions will take place with an estimated 20,000                     
              teachers enrolled.                                                             
                                                                                             
              The Project Director for this comprehensive project is                         
              Dr. Ira Geer.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              Cost-sharing equals 75% of the NSF award.
