Abstract    :
              A consortium of institutions in Nebraska, Wyoming, and South                   
              Dakota are adapting, refining and implementing the approach to                 
              teaching calculus being developed at Purdue University.  Issues                
              of computer anxiety and cooperative learning are being examined                
              during the implementation phase.  The adaptation phase will                    
              include introducing the use of graphing calculators.
