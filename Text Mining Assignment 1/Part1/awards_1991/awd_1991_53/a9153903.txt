Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Pennsylvania State University campus at York seeks Foundation              
              support for a four-year project intended to increase the number of             
              African-American and Latinos entering careers in mathematics,                  
              science, engineering and technology.  Students, recruited in the               
              6th grade, participate in the program in grades 7 through 12.  A               
              pilot program, begun in 1990 with 24 7th graders, entails weekly               
              one-hour classes, mentors, well-designed excursions and follow-up              
              discussions, motivational and vocational counseling sessions, and              
              parent involvement, all under the supervision of a broadly                     
              representative advisory board.  Funding of the project will                    
              underwrite the recruitment of 48 to 50 students each year into the             
              program.  A five-week summer commuter project will immerse students            
              in hands-on experiences, research projects, and excursions.
