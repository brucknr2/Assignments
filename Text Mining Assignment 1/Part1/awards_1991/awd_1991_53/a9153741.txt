Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              GMI Engineering & Management Institute proposes to build on a                  
              pilot program conducted in Michigan which delivers science and                 
              mathematics education to grades 4-9 in predominantly minority                  
              areas by way of interactive satellite television. NSF                          
              Presidential Awardee teachers conduct classes with a live                      
              studio classroom audience; these classes are simultaneously                    
              available to a number of classrooms by interactive television.                 
              Classes are based on curricula and instructional materials                     
              generated in NSF sponsored projects and satisfy guidelines                     
              established by NCTM for mathematics and by Project 2061 for                    
              science. Cost-sharing, at almost seven times the amount                        
              requested from NSF, is exceptionally high.
