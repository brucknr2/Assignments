Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Earth Game is a five-day simulation, modeled on the war games                  
              the military have staged for a hundred years.  An international                
              group of scientists, diplomats and political experts will react                
              to a simulated environmental crisis caused by global climate                   
              change.  The period of play is 1995 to 2010.  The proceedings                  
              will be videotaped and edited into four hours of television                    
              programming for international broadcast to a general audience in               
              the spring of 1992.  Earth Game is a project of WQED with the                  
              Smithsonian Institution, the British Broadcasting Corporation,                 
              Adrian Malone Productions, and the U.S. Naval War College.  The                
              objectives are: 1.) to stimulate greater public and governmental               
              interest in the subject of climate change; 2.) to foster greater               
              understanding of what we do and don't know about the causes of                 
              climate change, and 3.) to develop a greater appreciation of the               
              dilemmas posed by the need for political action in the fact of                 
              the threats and uncertainties surrounding climate change.                      
              Senior Smithsonian scientists, Naval War College game design                   
              experts, the distinguished television producer Adrian Malone,                  
              and a small group of advisers are planning the event, which is                 
              scheduled to take place in Newport, Rhode Island in November                   
              1991 at the historic facilities of the Naval War College.
