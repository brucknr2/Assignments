Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a three year project designed to build a science                       
              culture within participating schools from Hartford CT, and                     
              to promote environmental literacy.  The project will build                     
              upon previously funded NSF activities and will provide                         
              continued and expanded support to 15 of the teachers who                       
              participated in that previous program.  The current project                    
              will extend the program to an additional 78 teachers over                      
              the next three years (total: 93 teachers).  During the                         
              academic year, project staff will work with teachers and                       
              their students in the schools; during the summer, teachers                     
              will participate in a three week workshop.  Team leaders                       
              will be selected from among the participants to become                         
              resource persons and peer coaches in their home schools;                       
              they will receive leadership training and extensive support                    
              from project staff. Computers and related technology,                          
              including telecommunications, will be used to create a                         
              Center for Environmental Science in each school.                               
                                                                                             
              This project is appropriate for the Teacher Enhancement                        
              Program because it enhances participants' knowledge of                         
              science and effective teaching methods, identifies and                         
              trains selected participants to become lead teachers within                    
              their schools, establishes strong networking ties among                        
              participants and project staff, and targets teachers of                        
              predominantly (80% or greater) minority populations of                         
              children.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              Non-NSF cost-sharing is approximately 9% of the amount                         
              requested from NSF.
