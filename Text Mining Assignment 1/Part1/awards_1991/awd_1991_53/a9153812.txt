Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Norman Howard School Demonstration Project seeks funds                     
              for a three-year program to enhance 90 middle school                           
              mathematics teachers to respond to the needs of learning                       
              disabled (LD) students who are mainstreamed in regular                         
              mathematics classes.  The project will a) develop                              
              alternative instructional strategies that support learning                     
              disabled students' mathematics learning and embed these                        
              strategies in field tested exemplary geometry and algebra                      
              units; (b) implement three model teacher enhancement                           
              programs for middle school mathematics teachers from the                       
              Greater Rochester area; and (c) develop a "package"                            
              containing materials and suggestions to organize similar                       
              programs nationwide.  In addition to the Norman Howard                         
              staff, nine core teachers from four middle school sites will                   
              be members of the staff team and will be responsible for                       
              developing and field-testing materials to be used in the                       
              enhancement phase of the project.  The mathematical focus of                   
              the project will be introductory algebra and geometry while                    
              the instructional focus will be on construction of                             
              knowledge, use of manipulative and cooperative learning.                       
              Each teacher participant will be part of one of three                          
              enhancement models:  an intensive summer institute followed                    
              by year-long experiences involving classroom                                   
              experimentation; a series of ten workshops throughout the                      
              Fall semester of the school year; and a series of ten                          
              revised workshops through the Spring semester of the school                    
              year.                                                                          
                                                                                             
              Norman Howard School, University of Rochester and                              
              participating school district cost-sharing accounts for 32%                    
              of the NSF budget.                                                             
                                                                                             
              This project fills an important need, that of developing                       
              materials for and enhancing middle school mathematics                          
              teachers in instructional strategies in mathematics for LD                     
              students integrated into mainstream mathematics classes.
