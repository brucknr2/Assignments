Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal is designed to achieve a comprehensive,                          
              system-wide transformation of the Montgomery County Public                     
              Schools, Maryland (MCPS) system's elementary (pre K-5)                         
              science curriculum.  The new curriculum stresses student                       
              inquiry leading to science process skills as well as                           
              science content and positive attitudes toward exploration                      
              and cooperative learning.  The transformation will be                          
              spearheaded by a group of 40 experienced "lead teachers"                       
              who will each receive a minimum of 6 weeks of training and                     
              will then train "liaison teachers."  There will be one                         
              liaison teacher per grade level per school (approximately                      
              860 liaison teachers in all) who will then act as mentor/                      
              coaches to other classroom teachers.  Some of the liaison                      
              teachers will also work with the lead teachers to train the                    
              more than 1500 classroom teachers; classroom teachers will                     
              each receive a minimum of four days of training that will                      
              introduce them to the philosophy and pedagogy of hands-on                      
              teaching and learning, and instruct them in the use of the                     
              units adopted for their grade level.                                           
                                                                                             
              This project is appropriate for the Teacher Enhancement                        
              Program because of its systemic plan to enhance the science                    
              teaching of all teachers of elementary science in the                          
              district.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              Non-NSF cost-sharing is approximately 152% of the amount                       
              requested from NSF.
