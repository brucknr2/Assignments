Abstract    :
                   The goal of this project is to improve the retention rate                 
              of women at the undergraduate and graduate levels in science                   
              and engineering.  At the University of Rochester they are                      
              undertaking a series of semester-long activities which include:                
              (1) workshops and discussion sessions for teaching assistants                  
              and entering physics faculty to improve the classroom climate                  
              for women students; (2) giving presentations and holding                       
              discussions during physics faculty meetings on the issue of                    
              classroom climate for women; (3) having discussion sessions                    
              with women aimed at improving the college and graduate                         
              experience; and (4) evaluating the effectiveness of these                      
              activities on improving the retention of women in the sciences                 
              and engineering.  These activities will be repeated in another                 
              science department at the university during the second                         
              semester.//
