Abstract    :
              The University of Texas at Austin proposes to establish                        
              an Alliance for Minority Participation in Mathematics                          
              (AMPM) with the goal of eliminating the                                        
              underrepresentation of African Americans, Hispanics,                           
              and Native Americans in mathematics and related                                
              disciplines.  As part of the Alliance, AMPM will                               
              establish (1) an alliance of twenty-five mathematics                           
              departments each working to achieve the above aim, (2)                         
              expand the capacity of fifty mathematics departments                           
              that already have Emerging Scholars Programs.  The                             
              Emerging Scholars programs are designed to help both                           
              freshmen excel mathematics and science.  These programs                        
              will serve at least 1,500 minority students during the                         
              course of the award.                                                           
              AMPM builds on more than ten years of work at Berkeley                         
              in creating programs that increase participation in                            
              mathematical and physical sciences.  These programs                            
              have been widely copied and now exist in various forms                         
              on more than 50 college and university campuses.  AMPM                         
              will work with the major professional organizations of                         
              mathematicians to make the operations of these and                             
              similar programs a legitimate and mainstream activity                          
              of mathematics departments.  It is the aim of this                             
              proposal to assure that the next generation of                                 
              mathematicians represents the full diversity of                                
              American life.
