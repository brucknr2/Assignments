Abstract    :
                   This study is a twelve month effort to examine the                        
              implications of school-based management (SMB) on science and math              
              education.  The final report is intended for use by school system              
              personnel throughout the country and other educators.  It will                 
              provide findings and recommendations for systems considering, or in            
              the process of implementing, some form of SBM.                                 
                   The study will examine approximately 18 school systems, ones              
              that have had at least one year of experience with SBM.  (Six will             
              be examine on-site and twelve by extensive telephone interviewing.)            
              The study will focus on grades 7-12 to separate out SBM's science              
              and math implications from that of other subjects.  It will use in-            
              person interviews, focus groups, semi-structured questionnaires,               
              and an examination of documentation from these schools.  Using                 
              qualitative evaluation procedures, the study will analyze such                 
              elements as:  Extent of actual implementation, effects on science              
              and math educational practices, problems found, actions to                     
              alleviate problems and extent of alleviation, factors associated               
              with successful implementation of SBM, and initial perceptions of              
              effects on student learning and interest in science and math.
