Abstract    :
              The materials developed at the University of Illinois by Davis,                
              Porta, and Uhl are being adapted and some new materials are                    
              being developed to implement a laboratory calculus course.  The                
              materials emphasize extensive use of Mathematica programming,                  
              especially graphics routines, and conceptual questions that                    
              require written responses in paragraph form.  The curricular                   
              changes emphasize a systematic treatment of the approximation                  
              of functions throughout the calculus sequence.
