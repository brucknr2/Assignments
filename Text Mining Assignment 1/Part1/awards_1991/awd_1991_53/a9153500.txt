Abstract    :
                   This project at Brown University provides personal support                
              and enhanced academic opportunities for freshman and sophomore                 
              women planning to study the sciences and engineering.  These                   
              opportunities include:  (1) assigning each student to a faculty                
              mentor who will serve as a science advisor and to an upperclass                
              undergraduate peer mentor; (2) holding monthly group meetings                  
              to discuss scientific topics, lifestyle issues, etc., and (3)                  
              visiting laboratories, attending colloquia, and being involved                 
              in first-year laboratory experiences.  It enhances the enriched                
              academic environment that already exists at Brown University.
