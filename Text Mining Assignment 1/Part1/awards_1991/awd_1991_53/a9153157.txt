Abstract    :
              The project "UNDERSTANDING DYNAMICS OF ESTUARINE ENVIRONMENTS"                 
              is central to a revised marine science curriculum and an                       
              ESTUARINE SAMPLING PROGRAM (ESP) in Narragansett Bay near Brown                
              University.  Sampling equipment obtained through this grant                    
              consists of moorings of Sea Bird CTDs, dissolved oxygen                        
              sensors, and in situ fluorometers. Arrays of the ESP moorings                  
              allow the students to obtain continuous high resolution records                
              of the properties needed to understand the physical and biotic                 
              processes that influence population distributions. Automated                   
              moorings combined with supplementary sampling from small boats                 
              enable students to collect the data needed to adequately                       
              constrain circulation patterns, identify the scales of natural                 
              variability in biotic and physical processes, and develop a                    
              true understanding of how complex estuarine systems work.
