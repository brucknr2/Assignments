Abstract    :
              The three-semester calculus sequence is being revised to                       
              integrate the computer as an active component of the learning                  
              process.  A pilot program begun in 1989 is being expanded                      
              throughout the three-semester sequence.  A laboratory component                
              is being introduced in which students will modify computer code                
              written in True BASIC and apply the programs to a wide range of                
              mathematical problems.
