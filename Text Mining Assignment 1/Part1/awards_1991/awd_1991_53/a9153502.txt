Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              In partnership with the Dayton Board of Education and the                      
              business community, Wright State University is building a                      
              multi-faceted model program for maximizing the number of highly                
              motivated and academically competent women and minority                        
              students at Dunbar Magnet High School so that they go on to                    
              earn baccalaureate (and higher) degrees in the natural                         
              sciences.  Demographically, minority students constitute 80% of                
              the student body at Dunbar; the students are equally divided by                
              sex.  To attain the goal, several strategies are being                         
              included:  strengthening pre-college science and mathematics                   
              courses, offering a health-related scientific professions                      
              orientation course, broadening students' science background by                 
              discussing new discoveries, field-trips, demonstrations to                     
              illustrate concepts, giving students hands-on laboratory                       
              experience so that the "do science", workshops for teachers,                   
              opportunity for summer research for students and teachers under                
              the supervision of faculty mentors, encouraging teachers and                   
              selected students to accompany their mentors to professional                   
              meetings, and sensitizing faculty about the educational needs                  
              and "culture" of women and minorities.  Since most public high                 
              schools in large cities have racial demographics similar to                    
              Dayton's, the project has high potential for replication.
