Abstract    :
              Efforts are under way to collect and broadly disseminate gems                  
              of exposition in elementary linear algebra.  These include                     
              especially insightful proofs, short and open-ended problems,                   
              longer expositional items, and machine-oriented, computational                 
              exercises, all of which are designed to communicate fundamental                
              liner algebra ideas to beginning students.  Items are being                    
              solicited from a wide range of individuals worldwide and are                   
              being published in a volume designed to be available at low                    
              cost.
