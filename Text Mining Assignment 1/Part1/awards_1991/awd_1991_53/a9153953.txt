Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Pittsburgh Supercomputer Center, with the assistance of                    
              regional schools, has designed a program to help teachers and                  
              students to understand the way in which high performance                       
              computing is used by scientists and mathematicians and to                      
              strengthen student interest in both science and in the use of                  
              computers. A major goal of the project is to help to attract                   
              students to careers in the computational sciences.                             
                                                                                             
              Student-teacher teams will design supercomputer oriented                       
              science or mathematics projects and will compete for places in                 
              a summer program designed to enhance computer skills and to                    
              implement the projects.  After the summer sessions, teachers                   
              will interact with other teachers at their home sites to                       
              disseminate information and techniques and to integrate the                    
              project work into the school curriculum.  Intensive networking                 
              between the teachers, students, sites, and the Supercomputer                   
              Center will follow up during the school year.                                  
                                                                                             
              Cost sharing of $235,00 per year for two years amounts to 85%                  
              of the amount requested from NSF.
