Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project nwill investigate how language minority                           
              students appropriate new forms of scientific sense-making                      
              through their participation in collaborative scientific                        
              inquiry in biology (e.g., ethology, botany, ecology,                           
              embryology).  The investigation will be anchored in a                          
              description of the forms of scientic understanding                             
              that Haitian students in grades 5-8 develop and an anlysis                     
              of how these emerging forms are socially constructed in                        
              classroom settings.  In the framework of this project,                         
              understanding encompasses:  conceptual knowledge in biology,                   
              scientific sense-making practices, and epistemological                         
              beliefs about science.  The proposed work encompasses                          
              development of research instruments to probe the various                       
              dimensions of students scientic understanding, direct work                     
              with bilingual classroom teachers to enhance their                             
              competence to teach science as collaborative inquiry,                          
              developmental research with children to determine  how their                   
              scientific understanding changes overtime, and ethnographic                    
              research in classrooms to analyze how students scientific                      
              understanding is socially constructed.                                         
                                                                                             
              Through empirical study of the ways in which scientific                        
              understanding is socially constructed, this research will                      
              provide both a theoretical rationale and practical model for                   
              building sense-making communities in the science slassroom.                    
              It will characterize specific sense-making practices which                     
              engender the development of scientific understanding in                        
              language minority students.  In addition, through its focus                    
              on biology, it will contribute to an emerging knowledge base                   
              on conceptual change in biology.//
