Abstract    :
              This project expands the laboratory instructional and training                 
              of undergraduate students in the areas of geotechnical analysis                
              and design through the use of advanced geotechnical analysis                   
              equipment, electronic instrumentation, and laboratory                          
              sterilization equipment.  This equipment involves design and                   
              analysis of soil substructures, facility design, municipal                     
              process design,, analysis data base management, project                        
              development, and documentation.
