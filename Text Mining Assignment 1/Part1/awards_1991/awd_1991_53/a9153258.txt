Abstract    :
              Five community colleges are adapting a calculator-based curriculum             
              for calculus developed at Clemson University.  Workshops are being             
              conducted to introduce the ten faculty to the new curriculum and               
              implementation begins in the Spring Semester.  The ten core faculty            
              will then introduce the new approach to their colleagues as the new            
              approach is implemented in all calculus sections.
