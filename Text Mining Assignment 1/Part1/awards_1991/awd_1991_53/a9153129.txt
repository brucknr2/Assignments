Abstract    :
              This laboratory is utilized by the undergraduate students of                   
              the engineering and technology departments to acquire hands-on                 
              training in the modern manufacturing systems.  The major                       
              equipment includes CNC milling and lathe machines, motorized                   
              material handling equipment including a robot and programmable                 
              controller, and one personal computer with necessary software.                 
              Experiments introduce students to the areas of NC part                         
              programming, robot programmable logic controller programming                   
              and integration of manufacturing systems with computer.
