Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The NRC Study Group on Guidelines for Mathematics                         
              Assessment will undertake a two-year project consisting of                     
              three interrelated components.  The first is the development                   
              of a set of conceptual guides and principles that will be                      
              helpful to states and local education agencies, as well as                     
              private groups, as they create assessment instruments and                      
              systems.  The guides will set forth in some detail the                         
              factors that such agencies must take into account: choices                     
              of content, instrumentation, data analysis, data reporting,                    
              etc.  The second is an examination of technical measurement                    
              issues involved in alternative methods of assessment.  The                     
              third is a consideration of policy issues, including matters                   
              of relative costs of various forms of assessment, the                          
              effects in changes in assessment on curriculum and classroom                   
              practice, and issues of fairness and bias.
