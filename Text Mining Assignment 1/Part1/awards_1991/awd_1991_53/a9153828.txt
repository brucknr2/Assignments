Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal provides a plan for the establishment of a                       
              consortia program of teacher enhancement and instructional                     
              improvement in science.  The consortium involves three                         
              Historically Black Colleges and Universities in three regions                  
              of the Commonwealth of Virginia.  This consortium effort will                  
              establish mechanisms for school system science education                       
              improvement.  The institutions will provide training in                        
              science content and pedagogy focused on minority student                       
              achievement with the intent of increasing the pipeline to                      
              science careers for minority students.                                         
                                                                                             
              Instructional and project delivery mechanisms will include                     
              Saturday courses, summer workshops, satellite and                              
              teleconferencing facilities, and electronic news networks.                     
              All courses will be credited, if desired by participants, and                  
              structured to meet criteria for Masters' Degree Programs at                    
              Hampton University.                                                            
                                                                                             
              Cost sharing is equivalent to 21% of the NSF award.
