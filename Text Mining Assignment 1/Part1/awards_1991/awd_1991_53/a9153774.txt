Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The three-year New York City Mathematics Project is a staff                    
              development effort for mathematics teachers grades K through 12,               
              modeled on the National Writing Project. The teachers will come                
              from six districts in the Bronx. Through after school courses,                 
              summer institutes, leadership seminars, on-site consulting, and                
              the development of a mathematics resource center, a cadre of                   
              mathematics teacher leaders will be established. A total of                    
              ninety teachers will be involved in the project; 30 of these will              
              be part of the project for three years; 15 will be in the project              
              for two full years; the remained all will be with the project for              
              at least a year. A four-stage model of teacher development which               
              supports gradual implementation of new ideas and movement toward               
              leadership, guides the project. Teachers in Stage Four will be                 
              involved in leadership activities within their own schools and                 
              locally. Mathematics content focus includes geometry,                          
              probability, and number theory. A series of "urban vignettes"                  
              that can be used as an inservice tools for professional                        
              development of urban mathematics teachers will be produced and                 
              published through the project.                                                 
                                                                                             
              Cost sharing is provided by the university and NYC school                      
              districts as 60% of the NSF award.
