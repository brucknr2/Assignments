Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project is making efforts to see a national                               
              replication/dissemination of the New York Hall of Science's                    
              successful "Science Career Ladder", a career access program                    
              targeted to women and minorities.  The funds are being used to                 
              develop materials including a videotape and manual for us by                   
              replication sites.  The initial replication is taking place at                 
              25 science-technology centers and was begun with a Conference.                 
              Together, the conference and materials are providing an                        
              information and support system for replication of the                          
              Science Career Ladder at other sites.                                          
                                                                                             
              The Science Career Ladder model recruits junior and senior high                
              school women and minorities as Explainers for the museum, and                  
              is motivating them to become precollege teachers of science.                   
              It is a program aimed at enriching the experience for the                      
              students when they go on to undergraduate schools and are                      
              preparing to be teachers.  The high school students gain                       
              experience and knowledge through being trained as Explainers,                  
              and are then moved more deeply into the workings of the museum,                
              both exhibits and scientific research, as undergraduates.  The                 
              program is carried out in collaboration with five public                       
              colleges in the New York metropolitan area.
