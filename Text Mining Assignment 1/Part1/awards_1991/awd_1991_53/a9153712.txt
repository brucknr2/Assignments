Abstract    :
              A collaborative, multi-software, multi-hardware computer                       
              calculus laboratory manual is being developed. It is being                     
              developed with the needs of minority institutions directly in                  
              mind, but will also be available to the general college                        
              population. The manual draws heavily upon the previous calculus                
              project at Manhattan Community College. As a part of the                       
              development process, workshops are being conducted during which                
              faculty from other colleges will participate in writing the                    
              workbook and prepare to use the materials in their home                        
              institutions.
