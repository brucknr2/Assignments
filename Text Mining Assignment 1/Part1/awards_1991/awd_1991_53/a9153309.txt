Abstract    :
              A large scale adaptation, refinement, and implementation                       
              project is invigorating teaching and learning calculus for                     
              science and engineering students.  Innovations being adapted                   
              have been tested at each of the two participating institutions                 
              and at Iowa State University, New Mexico State University, and                 
              Cornell University.  The three year effort is taking advantage                 
              of both modern supercalculator and microcomputer technology and                
              incorporates group learning through team projects.  The project                
              will affect some 20,000 students over five years.
