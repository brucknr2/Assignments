Abstract    :
                The University of South Florida's "YES - WE CARE|" program,                  
              started in 1983, increases suitably prepared and motivated                     
              minority high school graduates for studies of science and                      
              engineering.  The University currently operates four centers,                  
              the last started in January 1991.  In this 30 week Saturday                    
              morning academic enrichment program, 6th through 12th grade                    
              minority students receive mathematics, science, computers, and                 
              engineering projects instruction from certified teachers and                   
              "role model" volunteer minority engineers.  The program is a                   
              community effort involving the University, county school boards,               
              industry, and the minority community.  In early 1990 the program               
              was selected to be one of Florida's "Programs of Excellence" ("a               
              program ... that could be promoted...statewide.")  "YES - WE                   
              CARE|" was conceived to operate de-centralized with minimal                    
              administrative hierarchy.  In October 1990 the enrollment was                  
              137 students.  To realize the full growth potential of the                     
              program (higher retention rate and expansion to new communities)               
              is requiring one-time efforts to strengthen instructional                      
              materials, develop proper diagnostic tests, provide additional                 
              teacher training, document the program's operation, and improve                
              public relations and parental and community involvement.  The                  
              NSF award is allowing for the implementation of these                          
              improvements.
