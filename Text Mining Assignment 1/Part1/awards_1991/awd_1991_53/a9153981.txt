Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project is a five year program that provides 80 contact                   
              hours of workshops to 40 middle and high school biology teachers               
              each year. Participants are recruited primarily from schools with              
              over 75 percent enrollment of underrepresented students. Sessions              
              begin during the academic year and continue into a summer week-                
              long session. During the workshops, teachers are updated in                    
              current advances in biological science and are provided with cost              
              effective, hands-on, investigative activities that convey state-               
              of-the-art concepts for use by all students. These activities,                 
              which feature cooperative learning, are easy to implement and                  
              cost effective. Teachers and their students may be invited to                  
              participate in university research laboratories in the Center for              
              Cancer & Developmental Biology.                                                
                                                                                             
              Evaluation of the project includes pre and post testing of                     
              teachers and their students, examination of teacher authored                   
              lesson plans, and examination of student research projects and                 
              their inclusion in county science fairs.                                       
                                                                                             
              Project dissemination occurs through required inservice                        
              workshops, distribution of project products locally and                        
              nationally, through school curriculum guides, and through                      
              publication in national science teaching journals.                             
                                                                                             
              Cost sharing in the amount of $314,165 equals 72.5% of the NSF                 
              award.
