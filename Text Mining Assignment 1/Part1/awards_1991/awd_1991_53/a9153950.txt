Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Mathematicians and Education Reform Network (MER), established             
              under a previous NSF grant, will provide a program to encourage and            
              promote deeper involvement of mathematicians in education reform in            
              grades K-14.  Network activities include national workshops,                   
              newsletters, a journal, programs and presentations at national                 
              mathematics meetings, maintaining a resource collection of                     
              exemplary materials, and pilot investigative studies.  Close                   
              cooperation and coordination with professional mathematical                    
              societies is to be maintained and a long range plan developed to               
              integrate MER activities within the structure of the professional              
              organizations.  Cost sharing is 62.5% of the amount contributed by             
              NSF.
