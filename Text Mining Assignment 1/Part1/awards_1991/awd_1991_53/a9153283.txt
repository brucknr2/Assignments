Abstract    :
              The materials and approach to teaching calculus being developed                
              at Duke University are being adapted and implemented.  The                     
              revised course emphasizes greater conceptual understanding                     
              through extensive writing, collaborative learning in a                         
              discovery-based microcomputer laboratory, and using mathematics                
              for modeling real world phenomena.
