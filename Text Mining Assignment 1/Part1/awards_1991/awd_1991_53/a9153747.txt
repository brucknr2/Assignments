Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Mississippi Alliance has developed a three component                       
              statewide strategy which will focus on undergraduate research                  
              and education to increase enrollment and graduation rates of                   
              minority students in science and engineering, a precollege                     
              outreach program with focus on early identification, and an                    
              industrial linkage to leverage NSF monies.                                     
                                                                                             
              The activities developed by this alliance are as follows:  1.                  
              six week summer residential experience, 2. student support                     
              teams, 3. undergraduate student research, 4. interdisciplinary                 
              seminars, 5. GRE workshops, and 5. an annual IMAGE Conference.                 
                                                                                             
              The average total minority enrollment in the participating                     
              institutions is 31%.  The average minority enrollment in                       
              science and engineering is 24%; AMP funds should enable the                    
              increase of underrepresented minorities in science and                         
              engineering.
