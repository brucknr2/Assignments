Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The objective of this project is to provide a complete                    
              package of KIDSPACE hands-on science experiences to small                      
              and developing science centers across the country through                      
              the National KIDSPACE Partnership Program.  This project                       
              will allow twelve (12) selected science centers to implement                   
              a complete, proven education package geared toward young                       
              children at a fraction of the cost of starting one from                        
              scratch.  This project will provide comprehensive training                     
              to a large core of educators within the science center                         
              field, and will support continued research into the informal                   
              science education of young children through an original                        
              Research Study and the formation of a national User's Group.                   
              Best of all, this project will generate a wellspring of                        
              invaluable science-play connections for hundreds of                            
              thousands of children to tale with them into adulthood.
