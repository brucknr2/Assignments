Abstract    :
                   This project builds on the success of the National Women                  
              in Engineering Program Advocates Network (WEPAN) to increase the               
              enrollment and retention of women in engineering at both the                   
              undergraduate and graduate levels.  Activities include:  (1)                   
              establishing three Regional Centers of WEPAN in order to provide               
              technical and programmatic assistance to institutions; (2)                     
              developing and implementing a Survey of Institutional Readiness to             
              assist colleges and universities in determining the feasibility of             
              initiating or expanding programs; (3) designing and conducting                 
              three Regional Training Seminars for administrators from 60                    
              colleges and universities; (4) developing and implementing a formal            
              evaluation methodology for measuring efficiency and effectiveness              
              of the programs; (5) using a statistical analysis to investigate               
              relationships between characteristics of women in engineering                  
              programs and enrollment and graduation rates of women; (6)                     
              publishing a semi-annual National newsletter, the WEPAN NEWS; and              
              (7) disseminating information and materials through an electronic              
              network, conferences and publication.
