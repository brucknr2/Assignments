Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The title of this program is "Boston Harbor Marine Research                    
              Program for Teachers."  Twenty well-prepared junior high                       
              school teachers will carry out marine research in Boston                       
              Harbor, focusing on a topic relevant to its pollution.                         
              Teachers will use a research vessel, oceanographic                             
              equipment and laboratory provided by Project Oceanology, a                     
              marine education center, and the University of                                 
              Massachusetts/Boston.  With the guidance of oceanographers                     
              and science educators, teachers will gain first-hand                           
              experience doing scientific research and will strengthen                       
              their understanding of the nature of science.  The program                     
              will also help teachers translate their experience into                        
              teaching methods and transfer it to their own classrooms to                    
              engage their students in scientific inquiry.  The program                      
              includes experimental design, laboratory investigations and                    
              field studies, data collection and analysis, presentation                      
              of results, and the design and testing of student research                     
              programs.  During 1993 and 1994, teachers will implement                       
              and test student applications of this program in a special                     
              summer session for minority and under-represented students                     
              at UMass/Boston and in programs in their schools.  Student                     
              programming will be designed and developed with the mutual                     
              support of their colleagues and the supervision of program                     
              staff.                                                                         
                                                                                             
              The program duration is 3 years, from Nov. 1, 1991 to Sept.                    
              30, 1994.  Non-NSF cost sharing is over 19% of the amount                      
              requested from NSF.
