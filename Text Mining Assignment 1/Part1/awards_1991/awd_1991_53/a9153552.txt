Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award initiates M2SE (Minorities in Mathematics, Science                  
              and Engineering Regional Center).  M2SE is a consortium of                     
              education, industry and community organizations whose goal is                  
              to increase the number of minorities in mathematics, science                   
              and engineering professions.                                                   
                                                                                             
              The Center program is a comprehensive sequence of activities                   
              designed to nurture and support minority students interest in                  
              mathematics and science beginning in elementary school and                     
              continuing through college.                                                    
                                                                                             
              The M2SE Center activities:  (1) provide students with                         
              extended-time and enrichment experiences such as after school                  
              programs, summer institutes and enrichment courses, advanced                   
              workshops, research apprenticeships, high school college                       
              bridge/transition programs and retention systems; (2) provide                  
              supplemental instruction to elementary, middle and high school                 
              teachers to enrich resources and techniques for teaching math,                 
              science and engineering skills; and (3) create opportunities                   
              for direct interaction between math, science and engineering                   
              professionals with students at all educational levels.
