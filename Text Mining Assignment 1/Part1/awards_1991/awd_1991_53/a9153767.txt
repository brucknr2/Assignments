Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project, sponsored by SUNY College at Fredonia, is a                      
              three year project working with 50 middle school teachers                      
              from the local school districts.  The teachers will be taught                  
              science content and pedagogy skills to prepare them to                         
              deliver an interdisciplinary curriculum based upon the New                     
              York State Middle School Sciences Syllabus.  In addition to                    
              the summer program there will be an academic year follow-up                    
              program.  In total teachers will spend almost 5 1/2 weeks                      
              each year on the project.  The project topics will include                     
              units on computers and technology based instruction teaching                   
              of, problem solving and inquiry skills, student centered                       
              hands-on activities and leadership development.  In addition                   
              to support from the college the project is supported by a                      
              collaboration of organizations including the local school                      
              district, the regional Board of Cooperative Educational                        
              Services and the Chautauqua Teachers Center.                                   
                                                                                             
              The matching funds provided by the college and the local                       
              school districts are equivalent to about 10% of the NSF                        
              grant.
