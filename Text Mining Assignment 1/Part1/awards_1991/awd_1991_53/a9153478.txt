Abstract    :
                   Freshman women are the target population for this project                 
              at Dartmouth College, since decisions made during the freshman                 
              year are considered to be crucial in determining whether or not                
              a student will major in science.  The project offers:  (1) an                  
              opportunity, generally not available during the freshman year,                 
              to work in research; (2) one-on-one work with a science faculty                
              member who can serve as a present and future role model; (3)                   
              "hands-on" laboratory work and firsthand experience with                       
              scientific inquiry; (4) two special Science Seminars, one each                 
              term; (5) an "Older and Wiser" program to pair participants                    
              with senior women majoring in science; (6) field trips to local                
              and regional science and engineering firms and laboratories;                   
              and (7) workshops and panel discussions featuring science                      
              majors, graduate students, faculty and non-academic scientists.                
              Vigorous campus support provides a strong foundation for this                  
              work.
