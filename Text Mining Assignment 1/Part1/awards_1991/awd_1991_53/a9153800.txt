Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The goal of this four-year project is to develop video case                    
              studies on scientific sense-making, these materials can                        
              then serve as catalysts and models for moving teachers in                      
              middle grades (4-8) toward a sense-making perspective in                       
              science and for linking that perspective to new teaching                       
              and assessment practices.  The project will integrate                          
              research based on intensive work with teachers from diverse                    
              backgrounds, video case study development, inservice                           
              delivery, and evaluation.  The aim is to first build,                          
              through collaborative research involving teachers, science                     
              educators, scientists, and educational researchers, a                          
              knowledge base an critical sense-making practices for                          
              teacher development in science.  The project will then use                     
              what has been learned to create a corpus of ten video case                     
              studies in scientific sense-making and an accompanying                         
              handbook for use in a range of inservice contexts.  The                        
              project final phase will be a documentation of the                             
              effectiveness of the video case studies in promoting a                         
              sense-making perspective among teachers in field tests                         
              during three contexts:  single session workshops, and long                     
              term sustained development.                                                    
                                                                                             
              The cost sharing will be 11% of the NSF portion.
