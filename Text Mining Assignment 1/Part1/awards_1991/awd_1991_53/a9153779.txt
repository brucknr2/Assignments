Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This three-year effort of the UNC Mathematics and Science                      
              Education Network is a statewide plan for enhancing teacher                    
              education in the area of statistics.  Each of nine sites                       
              across the state will be involved.  The project focuses on                     
              teachers of grades one through six, and will establish a                       
              structure in the state for encouraging and supporting the                      
              teaching of statistics in those grades.  The project                           
              includes a series of seminars in statistics education for                      
              university and college faculty; the development of an                          
              initial cadre of principals and elementary school teachers                     
              who will participate in professional development programs                      
              and implement plans to teach statistics in their schools;                      
              and to spread the project through the state by preparing                       
              cadres of statistics educators (elementary teachers who                        
              have participated in the project) and supporting their                         
              efforts with local school systems.  The project includes a                     
              research effort, as well as a strong emphasis on the                           
              development of professional materials for teachers.  The                       
              project will be a complementary effort to the North                            
              Carolina Statewide Systemic Initiative, which is directed                      
              by the North Carolina Alliance for Mathematics and Science.                    
                                                                                             
              In the first year, teacher educators from the regional                         
              sites will participate in a planning seminar, and will                         
              select local teams of teachers and principals.  Each of the                    
              nine sites will select a six-person teams.  A summer                           
              institute will be held in 1992 at UNC Chapel Hill for the                      
              teacher members of the teams, and the faculty members from                     
              the nine sites.  Principals will attend for part of this                       
              time.  Implementation and regional meetings occur in the                       
              1992-93 academic year; during this year each site also                         
              selects 24 new participants.  In summer 1993, three-week                       
              summer institutes are held at the regional sites, with 24                      
              teachers at each site, conducted by the local teams.  The                      
              inservice materials developed in year one will serve as the                    
              foundation for these summer institutes.  In the 93-94 year,                    
              regional support and followup is the major activity, and in                    
              the summer of 1994 a special one-week institute for                            
              statistics educators will be implemented.  In addition,                        
              summer institutes will be offered regionally in 1994, of                       
              two-week and three-week duration, with local support.                          
                                                                                             
              Cost sharing is included as 67% of the NSF award.
