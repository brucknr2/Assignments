Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The School in the Exploratorium (SITE) is implementing a                       
              three year multi-tiered program designed to prepare a cadre                    
              of 37 Lead Science Teachers from the San Francisco Unified                     
              School District and from Marin County school districts to                      
              implement district-wide hands-on science teaching.  Working                    
              in partnership with the newly implemented SFUSD's San                          
              Francisco Science Leadership Project and similar projects                      
              in the Marin County districts, SITE will provide intensive                     
              training in physical science, inquiry-based learning and                       
              school leadership for the Lead Teachers to support                             
              implementation of hands on science and the introduction of                     
              the new California State Science Framework.  This project                      
              will result in the creation of 34 Lead Schools in which the                    
              Lead Teachers will work with 74 colleagues also trained by                     
              SITE, to conduct on-site workshops for their colleagues and                    
              principals both in their schools and throughout the                            
              districts.  Additional activities include year-long                            
              internships for twelve science specialists for the                             
              districts.  These specialists will have experience planning                    
              inservice, working with students, mentoring teachers, and                      
              planning for district wide change.  Each school district                       
              has made arrangements for these specialists to take on                         
              positions of leadership and continue in that role after the                    
              NSF support is completed.
