Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Lesley College initially requested support for a two-year project              
              to be an extension and elaboration of its current project, Creating            
              Communities of Inquiry.  The three central activities of the                   
              project are:  (1) providing the opportunity for 80 elementary                  
              school teachers per year in the Boston and Cambridge, Massachusetts            
              to "shadow" practicing scientists in the private sector for 90                 
              hours, following which they will jointly develop a science activity            
              for the classroom; (2) establishing electronic networks that will              
              permit electronic mail communication among the teachers'                       
              classrooms, industry scientists' laboratories, and possibly college            
              and university laboratories; (3) conducting bimonthly                          
              teleconference among the teachers and their mentors to share                   
              experiences and ideas.  In the course of negotiations the project's            
              duration became 4 years, the number of teachers affected became                
              160, and the private sector's contributions more than doubled.
