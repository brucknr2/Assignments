Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              To focus attention on early education during National Science and              
              Technology Week, ASTC will hold an event on Capitol Hill                       
              featuring the Hands-on exhibit "What Makes Music?" on the physics              
              of music and sound.  The ASTC Honor Roll Teachers, selected by                 
              science Museums across the country for their exemplary use of                  
              science museum resources to improve science education in their                 
              schools, will be honored.  Thirty teachers are expected to attend              
              and take part in a one day workshop on inquiry based, hands-on                 
              science activities and experiments.
