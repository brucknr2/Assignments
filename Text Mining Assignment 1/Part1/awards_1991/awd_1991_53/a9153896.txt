Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Museum will develop an interactive traveling exhibition                    
              entitled "Our Weakening Web:  The Study of Extinction" that                    
              will explore the process of extinction and examine the                         
              current role humanity is playing in that process.  Is                          
              humanity accelerating the rate of extinction by modifying                      
              the global environment?  The goals of the exhibit are 1)                       
              that visitors discover that extinction is a natural process,                   
              2) that visitors explore the many ways humanity is modifying                   
              the world,s environment, and 3) that visitors understand how                   
              their actions are related to the world's environmental                         
              problems and how they can make changes in their lifestyles to                  
              help protect the environment.                                                  
              Three size versions (8000 sq. ft., 4000 sq. ft., and 1800                      
              sq. ft.) of the exhibit will be created in order to maximize                   
              the number of museums that are able to accommodate the                         
              exhibit.  After its opening in Cincinnati in 1994, it will                     
              travel to approximately twenty-eight museums during the next                   
              three to four years.  Each venue will have the exhibit for                     
              about four months.  Complementary activities will be                           
              developed and manuals describing these as well as sample                       
              materials will accompany each exhibit.  These activities                       
              will include a teacher's guide, local resource guide, on-                      
              floor demonstrations, short theater presentations, and an                      
              adult lecture series.  Sample press kits and copies of all                     
              promotional materials will be included in the exhibit                          
              package as well.//
