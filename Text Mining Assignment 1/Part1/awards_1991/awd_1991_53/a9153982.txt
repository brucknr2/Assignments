Abstract    :
                   The purpose of this project is to hold a Symposium on Graduate            
              Study in the Sciences for female science undergraduates from the               
              Pacific Northwest (Oregon and Washington) to provide them with the             
              information and encouragement needed to consider graduate study.  The          
              number of women receiving Ph.D. degrees in the sciences is far smaller         
              than the number of men who receive this degree, and the fraction of            
              female undergraduates who opt for graduate study is smaller than the           
              fraction of males who opt for graduate study in all scientific                 
              disciplines.  Those who attend this symposium will learn about graduate        
              education in general and about specific aspects of their chosen field.         
              They will also be involved in discussions about choosing a graduate            
              school, financial aid, life as a graduate student, preparation for             
              graduate study, career opportunities, and special concerns of female           
              students.  Sixty undergraduate participants (representing physics,             
              chemistry, mathematics, earth sciences, and the biological sciences)           
              from approximately 30 colleges and universities in Oregon and                  
              Washington will attend the symposium.  Symposium organizers will remain        
              in contact with the participants throughout their remaining                    
              undergraduate years and chart their progress towards graduate study.
