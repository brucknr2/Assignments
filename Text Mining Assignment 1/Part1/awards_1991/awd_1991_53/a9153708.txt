Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a three year effort for mathematics supervisors and                    
              teachers, grades 7-12, in the Three Rivers Regional Education                  
              Service Agency, a collaborative of 16 rural districts in                       
              Mississippi. The project will focus on the teaching of algebra                 
              and geometry, through summer and academic year activity for                    
              teachers, administrators, and counselors. A total of 80 teachers               
              and district supervisors of mathematics will be involved in the                
              project.  Sixteen pairs of junior high school and high school                  
              teachers will begin the program in the summer of 1992 in a four-               
              week summer institute; the last week of the institute will                     
              involve work in preparing to conduct staff development. The                    
              teachers will experiment with project ideas during the academic                
              year; in the second summer, 16 new participants will be added,                 
              and the original 32 will participate for two weeks. In the third               
              summer, an additional 16 teachers will begin, and the 48 prior                 
              participants also will be involved. With district support,                     
              participants will provide inservice to their colleagues.                       
                                                                                             
              Cost sharing is provided by RESA as 42% of the NSF award.
