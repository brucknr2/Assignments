Abstract    :
              This project establishes a holographic non-destructive testing                 
              laboratory. Students measure the stress, strain, deformation                   
              and vibrational characteristics of objects using laser                         
              technology.  The laboratory enrichs the laser electro-optics                   
              program, and students' experience, which better prepares them                  
              to continue their studies at the university level and/or to                    
              pursue their technical careers in the private or government                    
              sectors.
