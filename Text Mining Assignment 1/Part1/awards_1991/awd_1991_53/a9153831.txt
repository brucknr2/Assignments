Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This 2.5 year project will provide enhancement                                 
              opportunities in mathematics education for all teachers of                     
              grades K through two in Columbiana County, Ohio, an                            
              economically depressed, rural Appalachian area. The                            
              purposes are four-fold: to enhance teachers' knowledge of                      
              mathematics and developmentally appropriate pedagogical                        
              practices; to increase the use of manipulative materials in                    
              mathematics instruction; to foster awareness of cultural                       
              and gender equity issues pertinent to a rural setting; and                     
              to develop a cadre of teacher leaders who can help sustain                     
              the ideas of the project following funding. School                             
              principals will be involved in central ways. The project                       
              builds on an earlier effort supported with Eisenhower                          
              funds; 32 teachers from that early effort will serve as                        
              peer coaches and mentors in the current project. During the                    
              91*-92 academic year and summer, and then in the 92-93                         
              academic year and summer, all 174 primary teachers in the                      
              county will participate  in school-based inservice                             
              activities and summer institutes. The peer coaches will                        
              receive additional preparation and will work with the                          
              participants in their schools throughout the project. A                        
              strong qualitative evaluation process will support                             
              dissemination of the project's successes and strategies.                       
                                                                                             
              Cost sharing is provided by Kent State University and                          
              Columbiana County as 28% of the NSF award.
