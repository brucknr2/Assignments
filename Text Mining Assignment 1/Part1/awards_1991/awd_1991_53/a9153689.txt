Abstract    :
              The increasing presence of sophisticated instrumentation in                    
              undergraduate laboratories creates the need for excellent new                  
              experiments that exploit those capabilities.   We will develop                 
              and test six new integrated instrument-based laboratory                        
              projects for upper level chemistry courses.  They will                         
              emphasize inorganic and biological chemistry and analytical                    
              instrumentation, and they will be sufficiently modular to be                   
              insertable into a variety of upper level undergraduate courses.                
              The projects will address important, modern questions in                       
              chemistry and will provide students with opportunities to use                  
              powerful instruments to confront meaningful problems.  The                     
              projects will cause students to plan strategies, consult the                   
              literature, design experimental methods, solve problems                        
              encountered, and collect and interpret data.
