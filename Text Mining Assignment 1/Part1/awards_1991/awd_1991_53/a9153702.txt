Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              The University of North Carolina at Greensboro will conduct                    
              a three-and-one-half-year program to enhance 20 experienced                    
              middle school mathematics teachers in integrating calculator                   
              use into the mathematics classroom and curriculum.                             
              Participants will also design instructional materials which                    
              take advantage of calculators and will prepare themselves as                   
              leaders for communicating their new knowledge to colleagues.                   
              Each teacher will participate in a six-week summer session                     
              and 6 to 9 days of follow-up activities during each of the                     
              three years of the project.                                                    
                                                                                             
              Participants will earn a total of 18 graduate credits which                    
              may be applied toward a Master's degree in the School of                       
              Education.  Topics to be studied include functions and                         
              graphing for middle school teachers, teaching problem                          
              solving, probability and statistics, research in mathematics                   
              education, and using advanced technology to teach                              
              mathematics.  The project design also calls for the                            
              development of case histories which will evoke the effects                     
              of the intervention in helping teachers learn to use                           
              calculators in teaching mathematics.                                           
                                                                                             
              Participants will present workshops in their own school                        
              districts and through the Greensboro Area Mathematics and                      
              Science Education Center and the North Carolina Mathematics                    
              and Science Education Network.  In all, over 1,000 second-                     
              wave teachers and several parent groups should be effected                     
              by the project.  Cost-sharing by The University of North                       
              Carolina at Greensboro and local school districts accounts                     
              for 46% of the NSF budget.                                                     
                                                                                             
              Integrating calculators into the mathematics classroom and                     
              documenting the change in teacher and student behavior as a                    
              result of such teacher enhancement is clearly a worthwhile                     
              enterprise.
