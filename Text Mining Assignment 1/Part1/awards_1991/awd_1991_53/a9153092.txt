Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry, Physics, and Engineering at                       
              Norfolk State University is acquiring microcomputers, data-                    
              acquisition peripherals and software, and computation and                      
              simulation software to upgrade laboratory instruction in three                 
              programs.  Simulation and modeling software permits students to                
              study experiments too hazardous or expensive to actually run in                
              a laboratory.  Additionally, simulation software  permits                      
              training of students in the operation of laboratory                            
              instruments, thereby improving their skill level and their                     
              understanding of the principles of instrument design.Software                  
              and data-acquisition devices are identified for application in                 
              Organic Chemistry, Honors General Chemistry, Biochemistry,                     
              Analytical Chemistry, Physical Chemistry, undergraduate                        
              research projects, physics courses, and electronic engineering                 
              courses.NSF grant funds are being matched with funds from non-                 
              federal sources.
