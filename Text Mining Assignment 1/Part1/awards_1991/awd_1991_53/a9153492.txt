Abstract    :
               The objective of this project is to increase access to science                
              careers for student with disabilities.  The project staff is                   
              disseminating information in the Eastern North Carolina region                 
              to science teachers on the teaching of students with                           
              disabilities and about the career opportunities in science and                 
              technology for students with disabilities.  They are actively                  
              recruiting students in the area for careers in science and                     
              technology, and are providing science teachers in the region                   
              consultation on problems encountered by students with                          
              disabilities in science courses and laboratories.  A lending                   
              library of adaptive technologies is being established and will                 
              serve the region's junior and senior high schools as well                      
              Eastern North Carolina's community colleges.  The institution's                
              track record speaks well for the success of this current                       
              project.  In the Fall of 1986, East Carolina University                        
              established the Science Institute for the Disabled, and has                    
              made extraordinary efforts to provide higher education for                     
              students with disabilities.
