Abstract    :
                Believe and Achieve is a comprehensive and integrated                        
              curriculum of mathematics, science, and critical thinking                      
              especially designed for minority and female junior high school                 
              students.  The program uses videotapes and written lessons                     
              developed by faculty at the University of St. Thomas.  The                     
              major components of Believe and Achieve are: (1) instructional                 
              materials especially designed for minority and other                           
              underrepresented groups, which contain strategies for                          
              increasing these students' confidence and achievement; (2)                     
              interdisciplinary instruction among the mathematics, science,                  
              and English classes with material from each of the classes used                
              to emphasize points in the other classes, and critical thinking                
              and problem solving skills emphasized throughout; (3) an                       
              intensive five-week summer program, held on the University of                  
              St. Thomas campus, with a particular emphasis on computer                      
              programming, a hands on science project, and concepts of                       
              physics; and (4) a network of resources focused on the                         
              importance and usefulness of mathematics, science, and critical                
              thinking, and on helping to motivate student to higher                         
              achievement.  In many cases, students in the program are                       
              learning mathematics and science two years earlier than they                   
              normally would.  In addition, the students are given                           
              opportunities to achieve success solving problems with                         
              mathematics which increases their confidence and interest in                   
              pursuing advanced courses.  Teachers and students have been                    
              very responsive to this success.  Currently over 1200 students                 
              and 40 teachers are taking part in the program.  Within the                    
              year, it is estimated that 2000 students and 60 teachers will                  
              be involved.  The support of the NSF will allow the number of                  
              students in the program to increase rapidly.
