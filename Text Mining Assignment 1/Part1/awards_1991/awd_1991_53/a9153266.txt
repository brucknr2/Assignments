Abstract    :
              A new two-semester sequence is being developed that includes                   
              differential equations and linear algebra and that is based on the             
              philosophy and spirit of the first year calculus course developed              
              under the Five Colleges Calculus in Context Project.  Students gain            
              a better grasp of the concepts of calculus when they are presented             
              in the context of real and substantial applications that require a             
              combination of techniques and that involve open-ended problems that            
              often do not have clean, simple solutions.  Writing and the use of             
              computers are an integral part of this approach.
