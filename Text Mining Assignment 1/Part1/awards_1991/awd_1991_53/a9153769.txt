Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The title of this proposal is "A Novel Interdisciplinary                       
              Science Teacher Education Program for the Los Angeles                          
              Unified School District (LAUSD) with a Marine Science                          
              Thematic Approach."  The                                                       
              3-year program is designed to infuse marine science into a                     
              re-structured general science curriculum that can serve as                     
              a model to be replicated in all the schools in the                             
              District, where the student population is 80% under-                           
              represented.  The model will train a selected group (40                        
              each year) of LAUSD teachers of grades 5-12, who will in                       
              turn function as peer trainers in the LAUSD.  Training will                    
              focus on an integrative curriculum with a thematic emphasis                    
              on marine science.  The program will be guided by various                      
              educational resources that are available through the                           
              Consortium.  It will be implemented through the partnership                    
              between the Consortium and UCLA Extension services at                          
              various institutional sites and at the Fort Mac Arthur                         
              Marine Studies Center.                                                         
                                                                                             
              The project runs from February 1, 1992 to January 31, 1996.                    
              The cost sharing exceeds 41% of the amount requested from                      
              NSF.
