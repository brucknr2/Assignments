Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Lawrence Hall of Science, in conjunction with New York                     
              Hall of Science and the Astronomical Society of the Pacific,                   
              will offer a series of three-week summer institutes to                         
              experienced elementary and middle school teachers from                         
              throughout the United States.  The institutes will provide a                   
              range of experiences and resources for teaching astronomy                      
              and space science through classroom activities keyed to                        
              participatory planetarium programs, modern science updates,                    
              and field trips to observatories and planetariums.  Two                        
              institutes per summer, each accommodating 25 teacher-                          
              leaders, will be conducted in 1992, 1993, and 1994, for a                      
              total of 150 teacher-leaders.  Participants will communicate                   
              with an additional 100 teacher-leaders who attended similar                    
              institutes in 1989-90, via newsletters and meetings at NSTA                    
              national conventions.                                                          
                                                                                             
              This proposal is appropriate for the Teacher Enhancement                       
              Program because it is national in scope, and is designed to                    
              enhance science education in an area of science that is                        
              growing in its impact upon and interest to teachers and                        
              their students, but about which most teachers have little or                   
              no background.                                                                 
                                                                                             
              Non-NSF cost-sharing is approximately 66% of the amount                        
              requested from NSF.
