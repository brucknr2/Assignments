Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The techniques of mathematical modeling and simulation                    
              are changing the nature of both social decision making and                     
              scientific inquiry.  An essential feature of this change                       
              involves viewing complex, interconnected problems from a                       
              dynamic feedback systems perspective.  Today's students need                   
              a working knowledge of modeling, simulation, and system                        
              dynamics so that they are adequately prepared to become the                    
              scientists, engineers, and policy makers involved directly                     
              with problem solving.  We propose to study how students                        
              think about models and simulations with the aid of The                         
              Explorer, an interactive computer learning environment, and                    
              to see if the addition of system dynamics will work                            
              effectively as a scaffolding for the transfer of skills and                    
              understandings from one complex problem to another in a                        
              different knowledge domain.  We believe that integrating                       
              tools that aid in understanding complexity into science                        
              courses will provide the basis for a radically different                       
              approach to learning.  In this proposal we explore                             
              alternative ways of working with simulations and system                        
              dynamics.  This research has three components:                                 
                                                                                             
                   o    Identifying and assessing the development of                         
                        modeling-specific cognitive skills, and the                          
                        student's understanding of the nature and function                   
                        of a model.                                                          
                                                                                             
                   o    Identifying and assessing the development of                         
                        higher order analytical cognitive skills, and the                    
                        student's ability to transfer these skills through                   
                        different subject domains.                                           
                                                                                             
                   o    Augmenting an existing model-based curriculum to                     
                        facilitate implementation of the previous two                        
                        components.//
