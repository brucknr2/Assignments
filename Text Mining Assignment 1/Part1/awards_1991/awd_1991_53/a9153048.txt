Abstract    :
              The Instrumentation Technology program at the Texas State                      
              Technical Institute/Waco is developing a laboratory to prepare                 
              specialized electronic-electromechanical technicians for the                   
              continuous and batch manufacturing industries.  The intent of                  
              this laboratory development is to leapfrog the gap between                     
              current state-of-the-art training facilities and industrial                    
              needs through the integration of an entire control system.                     
              Through the use of process control and automated manufacturing                 
              as a unified system, expanded educational opportunities are                    
              provided by system-level integration of control components.  A                 
              high-level communication network using MAP is used to                          
              interconnect the various components from a centralized control                 
              station via a token ring platform.  The network and associated                 
              process control components are used to educate technical                       
              students to specify, purchase, install, operate and maintain                   
              this and other high level communication networks.
