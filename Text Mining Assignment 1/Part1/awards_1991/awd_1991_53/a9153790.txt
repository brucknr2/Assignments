Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This four year project, sponsored by Louisiana Tech                            
              University, provides three academic years of special courses                   
              work in chemistry and general science (physics/earth                           
              science/astronomy) for middle grades science and mathematics                   
              teachers.  The courses, while being essentially science                        
              courses, will emphasis the mathematics undergirding the                        
              science content.  These courses will be held at the school                     
              site and will be attended by 25 teachers each year.  In the                    
              summer, five selected teachers from the academic year program                  
              will each be teamed with a chemistry or physics high school                    
              teacher and will learn content, teaching techniques and take                   
              intensive training to prepare them to carry out professional                   
              development activities in their respective school systems.  By                 
              the third year of the project, approximately 450 teachers will                 
              have been involved in professional development activities.  In                 
              the fourth year of the project the program will be monitored                   
              and evaluated.                                                                 
                                                                                             
              The matching funds from the university and the schools                         
              constitute a match of above 48% of the NSF grant.
