Abstract    :
              The Department of Geology is purchasing automated X-ray                        
              diffraction equipment for use in introductory, upper division,                 
              and advanced courses, as well as undergraduate research.                       
              Students in introductory classes are participating in mineral                  
              indentification via local broadcast of data collected by the                   
              equipment into the classroom. In upper division courses                        
              students are using the instrument directly to analyze materials                
              collected during field surveys.
