Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              WGBH in collaboration with The Children's Museum will                          
              demonstrate how video technology can be used as an effective                   
              tool for teacher training in science.  The children's Museum                   
              current NSF project is developing a set of curriculum                          
              materials and teaching strategies to increase the                              
              effectiveness of science education in the middle schools and                   
              to encourage minority and female students to continue in                       
              science.  It brings together Bernie Zubrowski of The                           
              Children's Museum, who has run successful "hands-on" science                   
              education sessions for 25 years, teachers in Boston public                     
              schools, and the Massachusetts Pre-Engineering program,                        
              providing minority scientists in the classroom as                              
              participants and role models.  This combination provides an                    
              unusually fertile opportunity for documentation and                            
              instruction.  The WGBH project will produce three forty                        
              minute teacher training videotapes designed to support                         
              teachers who are attempting to implement this new type of                      
              instruction in their middle school classes.  The training                      
              tapes will be augmented by supporting print material -- a 24                   
              page guide for teachers viewing the tapes as well as a 16                      
              page guide written for college and university instructors                      
              who train teachers.  A full range of dissemination                             
              activities is also planned.                                                    
                                                                                             
              The cost sharing for the project will be sixteen percent of                    
              the NSF portion.
