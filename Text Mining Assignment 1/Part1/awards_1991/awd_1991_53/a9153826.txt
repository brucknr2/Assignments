Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project, in microbiology, is a three year program that                    
              includes 1) Summer Institutes, held at Boston University, 2) a                 
              series of local workshops conducted by lead teachers, and 3)                   
              outreach presentations given by all institute participants.  The               
              program is built upon a highly successful pilot program, using                 
              published materials developed by the program.  Emphasis is on                  
              hands-on activities, including all participant and student                     
              activities.  The target audience is secondary biology teachers.                
                                                                                             
              The Summer Institute offers two-week workshops for 20 potential                
              lead teachers each year.  In addition, each year, 20 lead                      
              teachers, selected from a pool of previous participants attend a               
              one-week institute to prepare them to conduct one-week, local                  
              workshops.  These workshops are then presented by teams of two                 
              lead teachers during the following year.  Lead teachers also                   
              serve as local resource teachers.  Logistical support for these                
              efforts is provided by a developing communications network and by              
              development of local support centers.                                          
                                                                                             
              Significant local cost sharing will be provided in support of the              
              local workshops.  Over 1000 participants will be served by the                 
              one or two week workshops and another 600 participants will                    
              participate in local outreach efforts of shorter duration.                     
                                                                                             
              An amount equal to 32.1% of NSF cost will be provided as cost                  
              share.
