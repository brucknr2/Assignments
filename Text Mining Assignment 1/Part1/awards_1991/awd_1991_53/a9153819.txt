Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Dr. Harold Slavkin is a research scientist at the University                   
              of Southern California, and an active participant in efforts                   
              to improve pre-college science teaching in the Los Angeles                     
              Unified School District (LAUSD).  Dr. Slavkin has organized                    
              Project PRAXIS, a 24-school effort to develop and implement                    
              an exemplary hands-on inquiry-based elementary school                          
              science curriculum.  These schools are located in central                      
              and eastern Los Angeles, in regions of high minority                           
              populations with little previous emphasis on science                           
              teaching.  Teachers and school administrators will work with                   
              university scientists and science educators to develop                         
              school-based instructional programs.  Teachers and                             
              administrators will be trained in the use of instructional                     
              science kits, which will be managed and refurbished at LAUSD                   
              regional Science Centers.                                                      
                                                                                             
              Project PRAXIS will create 24 centers of exemplary science                     
              teaching, from which other Los Angeles schools will draw                       
              expertise and guidance.  The students in the 24                                
              participating schools will be immersed in direct and                           
              relevant science activities that will develop their                            
              abilities to inquire and investigate independently. Their                      
              success will promote more widespread adoption of this                          
              approach, giving this project the potential for wide-ranging                   
              impact in this large school district.                                          
                                                                                             
              The Los Angeles Unified School District and the University                     
              of Southern California are providing cost sharing during the                   
              project's three years that amounts to 104% of NSF's                            
              contribution.
