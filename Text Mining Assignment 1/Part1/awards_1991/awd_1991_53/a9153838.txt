Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This three year proposal describes a joint effort between                      
              the New York State Education Department's Bureau of Science                    
              Education and Public Broadcasting Program in conjunction                       
              with New York State's Elementary Science Mentor teacher                        
              training network.  Video based inservice material will be                      
              designed and developed that presents hands-on problem                          
              solving to all elementary teachers regardless of their                         
              ability to attend workshops.  A secondary goal is to design                    
              and develope video based materials to inform and motivate                      
              school administrators and parents, to become actively                          
              involved in striving toward the long range goal of creating                    
              quality hands-on problem solving elementary science                            
              programs for their children.  The established Mentor                           
              network will be used to train one teacher/mentor in each of                    
              the 1,000 public and nonpublic elementary schools in New                       
              York State.  These 1000 teacher/mentors will then train or                     
              make available the "stand alone" video materials to the                        
              80,000 elementary teachers in their buildings.                                 
                                                                                             
              The cost sharing will be forty-seven percent of the NSF                        
              portion.
