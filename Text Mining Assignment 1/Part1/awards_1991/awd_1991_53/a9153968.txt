Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  A NATURAL HISTORY OF THE SENSES is a five-part series                     
              to be produced by WETA fornational PBS broadcast in the                        
              1993-94 season.  The series is to be adapted from the best-                    
              selling book of the same title.  Its author, Diane Ackerman,                   
              will present the programs and collaborate with the producers                   
              throughout.  Each program will focus on a single sense:                        
              smell, touch, taste, hearing and vision respectively.  Each                    
              will explore: how the world is sensed by animals and humans,                   
              including the evolution of the sense; what is perceived; and                   
              how human beings reconstruct and recreate their sensory                        
              worlds, through cuisines and perfumes, music, sculpture and                    
              painting.  Shot on location around the world, these                            
              documentary films will incorporate viewpoints from anatomy,                    
              physiology and neurochemistry, experimental and perceptual                     
              psychology, cultural anthropology, literature, art, music                      
              and history.  Compelling stories and illustrative vignettes                    
              and precise graphic animation will arise from rigorous                         
              research, in collaboration with a board of advisors.  By                       
              unifying material from science and the arts and humanities,                    
              the series will reach a general audience.  Viewers will be                     
              awakened to a new awareness of the range and power of their                    
              senses.  Companion materials for schools will extend the                       
              series to the formal learning environment and will motivate                    
              further study.
