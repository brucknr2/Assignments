Abstract    :
              FTIR Spectrophotometry in Undergraduate Chemistry                              
              LaboratoriesA Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer will                
              be incorporated in the microscale organic course, a new                        
              environmental instrumental analysis course, a course for                       
              medical technicians, and an honors general chemistry course                    
              focused on laboratory projects.  The instrument will introduce                 
              students to a modern instrument whose dedicated computer will                  
              allow for sophisticated data analysis and spectral searching                   
              and matching.  New experiments stressing practical industrial                  
              applications will be developed, including environmental                        
              analysis of waste dumps.  The grantee will match the NSF award                 
              from non-Federal sources.
