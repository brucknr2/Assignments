Abstract    :
              Computer technology is being exploited to produce a "leaner and                
              livelier" multi-variable calculus curriculum supported by a                    
              collection of Mathematica Notebooks and graphics packages that                 
              provide material for classroom use as well as problems that                    
              invite students to explore further the concepts of calculus.                   
              A text will result that will assume that students have access                  
              to a powerful computing environment, but not necessarily                       
              Mathematica.
