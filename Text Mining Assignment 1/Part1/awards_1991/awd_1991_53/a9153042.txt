Abstract    :
              This project aids in the implementation of an undergraduate                    
              interdisciplinary curricular program in design with plastics                   
              and composites.  The program is intended for majors in                         
              mechanical, chemical and materials engineering and in                          
              chemistry.  A major component of the curriculum program is the                 
              development of a new laboratory course in Practical Polymer                    
              Processing, which includes mechanical and structural design,                   
              material and manufacturing process selection, mold                             
              construction, component manufacture and final product                          
              functional testing.  Included in the course is a series of                     
              processing experiments designed to introduce students to                       
              essential elements of polymer and composite processing                         
              appropriate to each discipline.
