Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project, in Genetics and Biotechnology, is a four year                    
              program that includes a Summer Institute, held at the                          
              University of Wisconsin - Madison, and a series of local, 1-                   
              2 week, outreach workshops conducted by lead teachers.  The                    
              target audience is secondary biology teachers, with strong                     
              emphasis on the high school level.  Teachers in rural                          
              communities and teachers of minority students will be                          
              specifically targeted.                                                         
                                                                                             
              The Summer Institute offers a series of one and two week                       
              workshops, so that participants can choose their areas of                      
              interest. 120 participants will be accommodated in the                         
              Summer Institutes each year. 10 lead teachers will be                          
              recruited each year, from these participants, and will be                      
              trained to conduct 1-2 week local workshops and to serve as                    
              local resource teachers.  Logistical support for these                         
              efforts will be provided by a developing network of regional                   
              support centers based at University of Wisconsin System                        
              campuses throughout the state.                                                 
              Significant local cost sharing will be solicited to support                    
              the local outreach efforts.  It is anticipated that over                       
              1,000 participants will be served by local outreach                            
              workshops.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              The specific objectives of the program are:                                    
               a. to enhance and update teachers' background in genetics                     
              and                                                                            
                  the biotechnology of genetic engineering,                                  
               b. to provide effective curriculum and teaching strategies,

                  restructuring into the classroom,                                          
               d. to develop science education leadership in teachers,                       
               e. to develop strategies to make science education                            
                  particularly

              An amount equal to 43% of NSF cost will be provided as cost                    
              share.
