Abstract    :
                   This project evolved from Georgia Institute of                            
              Technology's FUTURESCAPE initiative, an effort initiated in                    
              1985 which has served more than 3,000 girls by using                           
              professional and undergraduate role models as the primary                      
              agents for changing girls' attitudes about science and                         
              mathematics.  In this project, a series of activities have been                
              developed to raise the aspirations, confidence, and preparation                
              of young girls in science and mathematics.  These include:  (1)                
              the K*I*D*S Club open to girls, ages 9 through 12, which                       
              provides activities designed to enhance interest in science;                   
              and (2) a Tech Summer Academy, a two-week summer enrichment                    
              program for rising 9th and 10th grade girls, to provide                        
              opportunities for academic enrichment and peer support.
