Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This 3-year project is designed to enhance the physical                        
              science knowledge base of 4-9 teachers in South Carolina.                      
              The plan is to develop science teacher leaders by using                        
              master science teachers for instruction and mentoring.  The                    
              target population will consist of teams of lead teachers                       
              from the same school and school district in order to                           
              strengthen communication and cooperation for the improvement                   
              of science education.  This proposal is an outgrowth of a                      
              previous NSF grant and a smaller trial project, and seeks to                   
              extend them.  Some of the groups co-sponsoring this proposal                   
              are an outgrowth of the previous grant, as are the co-                         
              directors.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              This project is appropriate for the Teacher Enhancement                        
              Program because of its plan to enhance the science teaching                    
              of a large number of upper elementary and middle school                        
              teachers                                                                       
                                                                                             
              Non-NSF cost-sharing is approximately 38% of the amount                        
              requested from NSF.
