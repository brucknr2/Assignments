Abstract    :
                   As a result of this project, 25 young women between the                   
              ages of 13 and 15 years will serve as interns at Texas A and                   
              M University during the summer of 1992.  The duties and                        
              activities carried out by these young women will be assigned                   
              by a woman faculty member or professional staff with whom the                  
              interns are matched.  In addition, the interns attend weekly                   
              lunch meetings and listen to speakers addressing career                        
              choices.  Specific scientific interest areas are addressed                     
              through field trips and seminars.  To help prepare them for                    
              their internships, the first hour of each day is spent on                      
              computer instruction for the purpose of learning wordprocessing                
              and simple spreadsheets.  This effort supports a diverse set                   
              of excellent role models.
