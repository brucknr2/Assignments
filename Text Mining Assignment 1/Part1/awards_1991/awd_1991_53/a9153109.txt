Abstract    :
              New applications of visible and ultraviolet spectrophotometry                  
              are being introduced into the laboratories of the following                    
              chemistry courses: General Chemistry, Instrumental Methods,                    
              Physical Chemistry, Advanced Inorganic Chemistry, and                          
              Spectroscopic Methods.For the General Chemistry laboratory low-                
              cost, single beam visible spectrophotometers are being                         
              interfaced to Macintosh computers currently being used for                     
              other applications in the laboratory. The resulting computer                   
              controlled spectrophotometer is giving students the capability                 
              to record visible spectra on a routine basis. Experiments are                  
              being introduced involving visible spectrophotometry in                        
              quantitative analysis, in the study of reaction kinetics, and                  
              in the study of transition metal complexes.For the upper level                 
              chemistry laboratories a high resolution, double-beam                          
              spectrophotometer is being used in experiments involving                       
              quantitative analysis, ultraviolet spectra of organic                          
              compounds, the study of reaction Kinetics, the study of                        
              coordination complexes, and the study of vibrational and                       
              rotational fine structure of molecular spectra.
