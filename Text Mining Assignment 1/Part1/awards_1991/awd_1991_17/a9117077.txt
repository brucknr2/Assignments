Abstract    :
              This projects deals with optical spectroscopy of metal ions in                 
              crystalline solids.  The research utilizes laser based tunable                 
              spectroscopic techniques applied to investigate dynamical processes            
              in the excited state, cooperative transitions, and dynamic effects             
              involving elementary excitations.  A major objective is                        
              understanding how optical energy absorbed by ion in crystals is                
              subsequently dissipated in the solid.  The research also involves              
              instrument temporal dynamics and nonequilibrium narrow band, high              
              frequency elementary excitations of ordered systems.  These issues             
              are of fundamental interest and are important for the development              
              of new laser materials.
