Abstract    :
              This project is for a geologic and petrologic investigation of the             
              Yunaska Volcanic Center.  Yunaska has been chosen because it: 1)               
              sits on unextended crust of the arc massif; 2) has numerous unusual            
              geomorphic characteristics; 3) displays evidence for both young and            
              old vent areas; 4) is spatially removed from the Amlia Fracture                
              Zone; and 5) occurs in a geologically unknown part of the ALeutian             
              arc.  The PIs plan to map and sample extensively the island during             
              three field seasons.  Using this information as well as K-Ar                   
              dating, they will reconstruct the geologic history of the island.              
              Analytical work will characterize the volcanic rocks                           
              petrographically as well as geochemically. This detailed                       
              characterization of Yunaska should improve materially our knowledge            
              of the Aleutian arc as well as the petrologic processes responsible            
              for its volcanic products.  Ultimately, such information should                
              enhance our understanding of subduction magmatism in general.
