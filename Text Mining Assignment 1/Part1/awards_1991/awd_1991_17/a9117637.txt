Abstract    :
              The principal investigator will attempt to determine equations of              
              state and other properties of fluids in four chemical systems of               
              geologic interest. Measurements will be made up to temperatures of             
              1100C and 25 kbar and will thereby extend P-V-T-X data for these               
              systems to high-pressure/temperature conditions that are of                    
              considerable geologic interest. The data also will be used to more             
              accurately pinpoint the phase equilibrium boundaries of several                
              important mineralogical reactions.
