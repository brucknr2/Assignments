Abstract    :
              Volcanoes are an important source of trace metals and gases to the             
              atmosphere.  However, the volume of these gases and aerosols                   
              emitted annually is unknown.  The principal objective of this                  
              project is to determine the emission rate of SO2 and trace gases               
              and metals from volcanoes in Kamchatka, USSR, especially volcanoes             
              of andesitic composition.  The emission rate of SO2 will be                    
              measured by a semi-automated correlation spectrometer (COSPEC V).              
              Aerosols will be sampled using a quartz crystal microbalance                   
              cascade impactor and examined by scanning electron microscopy to               
              characterize their size and composition.  Logistical support will              
              be provided by the Institute of Volcanology on Kamchatka.  the                 
              project should not only provide new data and insight into the                  
              aerosols emitted by andesitic volcanoes, but will also enable                  
              American scientists to study volcanoes in a previously restricted              
              part of the world.
