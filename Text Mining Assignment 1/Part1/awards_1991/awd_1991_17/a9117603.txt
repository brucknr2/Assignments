Abstract    :
                   Most organisms live in worlds that are spatially                          
              structured.  The purpose of this grant is to use dynamic, state                
              variable models (which couple environmental and physiological                  
              parameters in a consistent manner) to study spatial and multi-                 
              trophic level aspects of insect-plant and host-parasitoid                      
              interactions.  In the course of this work, three main goals will               
              be achieved.  First, the methodology of dynamic state variable                 
              modeling will be extended to include spatial structure.  Second,               
              such extended models will be used to determine how the                         
              descriptions of how populations change over space or time arise                
              from individual behavior.  Third, the predictions of the theory                
              will be tested using a three trophic level system consisting of a              
              plant, a fruit fly that attacks the seeds of the plant, and a                  
              wasp that attacks the fruit fly.  The experimental system chosen               
              uses a fly that is closely related to the apple maggot fly, so                 
              that insights learned in this work may have important applied                  
              implications in pest control.  The combination of experiment and               
              theory is ideal for the development of new and important insights              
              into behavioral evolutionary ecology.
