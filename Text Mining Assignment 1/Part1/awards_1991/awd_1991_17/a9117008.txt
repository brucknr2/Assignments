Abstract    :
              Scientific data types show promise for support of scientific                   
              computing at all computer system levels, from programming and                  
              visualization tasks, through compiler and database technology, to              
              operating systems. Rather than having a distinct data type                     
              mechanism at each level, this project concentrates on a                        
              coordinated approach across the levels of compiling, data                      
              management and operating systems, centered on database support                 
              for scientific data types. Key aspects of the project are the                  
              development and deployment of a Hybrid Data Manager as a software              
              substrate for rapid experimentation in coordinated data type                   
              support across these layers. The HDM uses object-oriented                      
              database technology to build a powerful front end for data type                
              instances residing in other storage systems. Existing datasets,                
              as well as newly created objects are to be supported using a                   
              staged approach that can lend some support to existing codes                   
              while providing full data type support for newly created                       
              applications. An important phase of the project is the deployment              
              of the HDM on applications in current use in two scientific                    
              domains, computational molecular chemistry and microstructure                  
              property predictions in materials science. The experience gained               
              in this project will provide input in the design of a new                      
              generation of database systems that will better support the space              
              and modeling demands of scientific applications as well as                     
              integrate tightly with compiler and operating system components                
              for increased performance.
