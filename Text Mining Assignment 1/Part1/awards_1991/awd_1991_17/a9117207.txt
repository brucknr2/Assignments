Abstract    :
              This is a travel grant that will provide support for                           
              students and young faculty with no other means of                              
              travel support, and to a keynote speaker, to attend                            
              the Symposium on Micro Structures, Sensors, and                                
              Actuators, to be held during the 1991 American                                 
              Society of Mechanical Engineers Winter Annual                                  
              Meeting at Atlanta, Georgia, December 1-5, 1991.                               
              The funds will be distributed among mechanical and                             
              electrical engineering students with priority on those                         
              students giving papers.  This activity will enable                             
              student participation in this important conference,                            
              and it will provide a forum for cross disciplinary                             
              dialogues between the two communities.
