Abstract    :
                   This award provides partial funding for the acquisition of a              
              4-wheel drive vehicle for use by University of Rhode Island field              
              geologists. The University is committed to providing matching funds            
              for the acquisition and has submitted a maintenance and operation              
              plan that ensures its efficient use.                                           
                   The Principal Investigator and colleagues in the Department               
              of Geology at the University of Rhode Island have an active program            
              of research on the evolution of life in the area of the Gulf of                
              Mexico during the Mesozoic period. Unique early-to-middle-Jurassic-            
              aged vertebrate fossils (including one of the earliest mammals                 
              known and rare reptilian and dinosaur forms) and excellent rock                
              exposures are found in northeastern Mexico, and much of the                    
              research of the Rhode Island team during the field season is                   
              concentrated in Huizachal Canyon, Sierra Madre Oriental Mountains.             
              The remoteness of most of their field area and the geographic                  
              breadth to be covered requires reliable transportation.
