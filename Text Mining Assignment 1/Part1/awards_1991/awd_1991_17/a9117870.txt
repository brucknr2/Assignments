Abstract    :
              The goal of this research is to continue investigation of automated            
              reasoning in elementary geometry, differential geometry, and                   
              mechanics.  It covers not only theorem proving, but also formula               
              derivation.  In each of these three areas, the following research will         
              be conducted:  (1) to improve existing proving techniques; (2) to              
              further study mechanical formula derivation; (3) to collect a                  
              significant number of worked examples; (4) to improve Ritt-Wu's                
              decomposition algorithm and other key algorithms; (5) to combine               
              Ritt-Wu's method with Collins' method in elementary geometry; (6) to           
              study practical application of resulting techniques to areas such as           
              kinematic synthesis of linkages and mechanisms, CAD/CAM, etc.
