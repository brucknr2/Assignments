Abstract    :
              Kuh         This a joint project with the UC at Berkeley (S. Kuh), UC at  Santa
              Barbara (M. Marek-Sadowska) and UC at San Diego (C.-K.  Cheng and T.C. Hu). 
              Integrated circuit (IC) design is now  dominated by wires which can no longer
              be considered as perfect  conductors.         The long term goal of this
              research is to find a new CAD  methodology for designing high-performance large
              and dense  circuits which have a large portion of the physical layout  occupied
              by the wires.  New algorithms with major emphasis on  ability to handle
              efficiently very large problem instances are  being developed.  These include
              algorithms for the problem of  extended floor-planning; such as,
              performance-driven  partitioning, timing simulation including transmission
              lines,  clock skew optimization, routing and compaction.  Also being  developed
              are algorithms to solve problems which span the  boundaries of several of these
              classical problems and explore  dependencies which were previously not studied.
               Much of this  research is common to high performance design of both 
              high-density chips and multichip modules.
