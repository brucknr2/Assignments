Abstract    :
                   During Mesozoic and Tertiary time the western margin of North             
              America developed by the accretion and rearrangement of numerous               
              fault-bounded blocks or terranes.  Detritus shed from these blocks             
              accumulated in basins and may record some of the history of this               
              tectonism.  This project will address several questions by use of              
              Sm-Nd and U-Pb isotopic studies of Mesozoic sequences in northern              
              Washington State and southern British Columbia, including                      
              determining when the terranes arrived and began to contribute                  
              detritus to the basins and whether the volcanic activity recorded              
              in the basins reflects oceanic or continental margin volcanic arcs.            
              Results are expected to provide new insights to the tectonic                   
              development of northwestern North America and to further                       
              demonstrate the utility of this technique.
