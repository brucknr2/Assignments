Abstract    :
              This award is in support of the ANSMET (Antarctic Search for                   
              Meteorites) program.  The first goal of the project has been to                
              locate and collect meteorites in Antarctica, and return them for               
              distribution to interested scientific researchers.  A second goal              
              has been to understand how the meteorite concentrations are related            
              to ice-sheet dynamics.  The ANSMET collection includes many                    
              meteorites of previously unknown types and varieties; continued                
              collection is expected to provide many more such specimens,                    
              including new lunar samples and others of possible martian origin.             
              Field study of meteorite stranding surfaces will continue,                     
              collecting information on the incompletely understood relationship             
              between exposed ice and the meteorite concentrations.
