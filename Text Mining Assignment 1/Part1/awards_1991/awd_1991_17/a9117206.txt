Abstract    :
              El-Amawy         A new clock distribution scheme for arbitrarily large  parallel
              and distributed systems, called the branch-and-combine  scheme, is proposed. 
              This scheme can guarantee a constant skew  upper-bound irrespective of the
              system size.  A theoretical  foundation for such schemes is developed to
              address other  critical design issues.  The model will be instrumental in 
              establishing formal relationships among topological properties of  the clock
              distribution networks, the timing constraints, and the  upper skew bound. 
              Other relevant issues in clock design are also  being studied.
