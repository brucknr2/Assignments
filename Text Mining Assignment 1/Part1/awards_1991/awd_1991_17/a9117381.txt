Abstract    :
              Examining sudden changes in climate is an important aspect of                  
              paleoclimate and paleoceanographic research. The North Atlantic                
              Ocean is particularly critical, since changes in this region may               
              be related to major changes in the deep ocean ventilation and                  
              circulation rates. Additionally, the proximity of large northern               
              hemisphere ice sheets have significant impact on North Atlantic                
              oceanography during glacial times. Study of the oceanographic and              
              climate history revealed in sediments may allow correlation to                 
              the climate record recovered from ice coring projects in                       
              Greenland.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              The present award will support study of short timescale                        
              variations in the North Atlantic and the evolution of climate                  
              during the Pliocene. Previous work at ODP site 609 has revealed                
              variability in sedimentation on a 1000 year time scale, as well                
              as features at a 10,000 year time scale. Work in this award will               
              attempt to map the distribution of these events using existing                 
              cores, and will extend the previous study back in time at                      
              appropriate DSDP/ODP sites.
