Abstract    :
              The Sleeper deposit presents the opportunity to study the details              
              of gold (and silica) depositional processes                                    
              over a wide vertical interval, extending from depths of 500m to                
              almost the original paleosurface.  The proposed                                
              research consists of 1) detailed (band-scale) isotopic,                        
              trace-element geochemical, and textural studies of the                         
              shallow banded ore to document the isotopic and geochemical                    
              signature of the ore-forming fluids; 2) studies of                             
              deep veins, which will include fluid inclusion, isotopic,                      
              mineralogic, textural, and trace-element geochemical                           
              analyses.  The data generated should provide input for                         
              thermochemical modeling, which should in turn provide                          
              tests of hypotheses formulated to explain salient features of the              
              banded high-grade ore at the Sleeper deposit.                                  
              Results will provide new insights into gold depositional processes             
              in shallow epithermal vein systems and how                                     
              the processes change with depth.  It also will refine existing                 
              genetic and exploration models for these vein                                  
              systems.
