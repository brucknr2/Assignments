Abstract    :
                   This research involves the investigation of the seismic                   
              structure and tectonics of back-arc spreading centers and                      
              subducting slabs using body waveforms.  The structure of back-arc              
              basins undergoing current extension will be compared to the                    
              structure of inactive backarcs, and the width of the zone of low               
              seismic velocity and high attenuation beneath backarc rifts will               
              be determined.  Also, the configuration of possible aseismic                   
              extensions of slabs into the lower mantle will be investigated by              
              means of S-wave residuals.  In both studies, earthquake body                   
              phases along several paths will be utilized to reduce the effect               
              of earthquake location and seismic structure uncertainties.
