Abstract    :
                   This grant funds conference on the chemistry plant-herbivore              
              interactions, one of the Gordon Research Conference.  This                     
              conference will stress the interdisciplinary nature of plant-                  
              herbivore system in terrestrial and marine environments, and                   
              bring individuals together from academia and industry, from                    
              senior and junior levels, from different countries, and                        
              different plant-herbivore systems.  Important timely topics,                   
              including those impacting humans directly, will be addressed in                
              an atmosphere conducive to discussions, with active leaders in                 
              the fields giving presentations, but with an unusual amount of                 
              time for interaction and discussion.  New insights can be                      
              expected that with many approaches to theory and mechanisms                    
              coalescing in new ways.  There is no other meeting of this nature              
              which attempts to really cross the boundaries of disciplines and               
              systems in plant-herbivore interactions.
