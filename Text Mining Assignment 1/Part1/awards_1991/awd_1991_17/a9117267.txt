Abstract    :
              This is a an award to provide renewal support for research                     
              that was initiated under NSF Grant No. 88-13714,                               
              objectives of which were to determine the conditions under                     
              which the inhibition of metabolic processes in selected                        
              microorganisms for production of enzymes could be used to                      
              predict the effect of toxic substances on microorganisms                       
              organisms used in submerged culture, biological wastewater                     
              treatment processes.  Results included the application of                      
              findings to development of a short-term, bioassay                              
              procedure for determination of heavy metal toxicity in                         
              environmental media.                                                           
              Objectives of this project include efforts to increase the                     
              sensitivity of the biosensing procedure by altering the                        
              permeability of the test-organism's cell wall.  Work will                      
              include efforts to simplify the conduct of the procedure                       
              that would enhance its potential for routine use in                            
              improving operation of biowastewater treatment processes,                      
              investigate its potential for use in bioassays to                              
              distinguish between heavy metal and organic toxicants, and                     
              in evaluation of heavy-metal toxicity associated with                          
              contaminants associated with solid substances such as                          
              sediments, soils, sludges and ash from incineration                            
              processes.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              Results of this research are expected to be utilized in                        
              the  engineering design of biological treatment processes                      
              that are subjected to being impacted by toxicants, in                          
              assessing the impacts of waste discharges to the                               
              environment, in determining the impacts of toxicants on                        
              potential water reuse for agricultural and industrial                          
              purposes, and in evaluating results of bio-, chemical-,                        
              and physical- procedures that are applied to remediation                       
              of hazardous waste sites.
