Abstract    :
              This meeting will focus on recent insights into the molecular                  
              mechanisms responsible for genome replication and for general and              
              site specific recombination.  Recent work has uncovered an                     
              impressive similarity between the mechanisms involved in                       
              recombination and replication, and between the pathways used for               
              these DNA transactions in prokaryotes and eukaryotes.  This                    
              symposium will highlight the most recent findings in all of the                
              most relevant areas, with special emphasis on those of high current            
              interest and progress.  These topics include: the initiation and               
              termination of DNA replication; DNA-unwinding and strand transfer              
              reactions; cell cycle control; fidelity mechanisms for genome                  
              duplication; site-specific recombination (including reactions                  
              involved in immunoglobulin gene rearrangements); and transposition             
              (including retroviral integration).  In addition to their                      
              fundamental importance, these topics are relevant to medical                   
              research in cancer, gene transfer and AIDS.
