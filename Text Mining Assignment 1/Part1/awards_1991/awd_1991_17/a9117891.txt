Abstract    :
                This research is to support a piggyback seismic experiment to                
              an existing program PACE (Pacific-Arizona Crustal Experiment)                  
              sponsored by the USGS.  Seismic instruments from industry and the              
              PASSCAL array will be utilized in three deployments for a total                
              of 41 shots by the USGS.  The piggyback will produce 2 high-                   
              resolution low-fold P and S wave sections: one is a 50 km long                 
              dip profile across the Palo Verde Mountains, the Midway                        
              Mountains, the Chocolate Mountains, and the Chocolate Mountains                
              thrust fault.  The other is a 27 km oblique strike line along the              
              Chocolate Mountains thrust.  The goals include delineation of                  
              crustal structure down to the Moho and the relation and                        
              properties of the Orocopia schist formation.
