Abstract    :
              The distribution, abundance, feeding habits and growth rates of                
              fish early life stages within Gerlache Strait, Antarctica will be              
              examined in relation to physical and biological processes.  This               
              project is part of the interdisciplinary program RACER (Research               
              on Antarctic Ecosystem Rates).  Samples were collected during one              
              month long cruises during October-November 1989 (spring), and                  
              December 1991-January 1992 (summer) and April-May 1992 (early                  
              winter).  Young fish assemblages were sampled with vertically and              
              horizontally stratified zooplankton tows and oblique tows.                     
              Laboratory work will include stomach content analysis and growth               
              rate determination using otolith daily growth rings.                           
                                                                                             
              This project is the first detailed description of larval fish                  
              assemblages in nearshore Antarctic Peninsula waters.  It will                  
              permit evaluation of the importance of the highly productive                   
              coastal area relative to offshore waters in supporting                         
              ichthyoplankton assemblages and mechanisms affecting larval                    
              dispersal.  It will add information on higher trophic levels in                
              this highly productive regions of the coastal ecosystem.  It will              
              also provide basic biological information on the young stages of               
              commercially and ecologically important fish stocks.
