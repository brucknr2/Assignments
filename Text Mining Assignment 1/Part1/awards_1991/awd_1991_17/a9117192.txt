Abstract    :
              Professor Kivelson is supported by a grant from the Theoretical                
              and Compuational Chemistry Program to study motions of                         
              molecules in liquids, especially supercooled liquids whose                     
              motions exhibit many anomalous properties.  Experimental                       
              dynamic light scattering measurements will be carried out                      
              together with relevant computer molecular dynamics simulations,                
              and the results will be used, together with extant data, to                    
              develop theoretical models relating the molecular motions to                   
              the structure of the liquids.  Kivelson will devote a major                    
              portion of his research effort to searching for a correlation                  
              length which diverges with decreasing temperature for                          
              supercooled liquids in an effort to confirm the existence of a                 
              second order (or higher) phase transition.  In another aspect                  
              of his research, Kivelson will study the high-frequency                        
              molecular motions in liquids which are characterized by cage                   
              rattling and barrier crossing.                                                 
              %%%                                                                            
              Since most chemical reactions take place in solution, it is of                 
              fundamental importance in the field of chemistry to have a                     
              molecular level understanding of molecular motion and the                      
              interaction between solute and solvent.  Kivelson's research                   
              involves the use of light scattering experiments and computer                  
              simulation to further our understanding of this detailed                       
              molecular picture.
