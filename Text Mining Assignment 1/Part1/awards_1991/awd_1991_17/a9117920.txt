Abstract    :
                   Contrasting styles of deformation to some degree are commonly             
              exhibited along strike in orogens despite being developed in                   
              basically the same tectonic setting.  This proposal will                       
              investigate a particularly abrupt change in Cretaceous deformation             
              style along the western cratonic margin in Sonora, Mexico that is              
              represented by the ductilly deformed crystalline rocks in                      
              northwestern Sonora and gravity-driven low-temperature slide masses            
              in eastern Sonora.  Deformation in both areas is the consequence               
              of Cretaceous convergence, and this study is expected to illuminate            
              the response of the crust to the tectonism.  Results may guide                 
              research in similar orogens showing along-strike changes in                    
              tectonic style.
