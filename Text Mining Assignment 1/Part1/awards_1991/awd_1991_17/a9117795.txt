Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Research is proposed to investigate the intracellular signal              
              transduction pathways that regulate the synthesis of defensive                 
              proteinase inhibitor proteins in plant leaves in response to                   
              herbivore and pathogen attacks. Our previous research has provided             
              strong evidence that the inducible signalling pathways that                    
              regulate two proteinase inhibitor genes in tomato, potato, and                 
              alfalfa plants, and likely in other plants as well, involve a                  
              lipid-based system that results in the production of jasmonic acid             
              as a key signalling molecule. The evidence suggests that insect or             
              pathogen attacks produce extracellular signals that interact with              
              the plant cell membrane to release linolenic acid. Linolenic acid              
              is known to be converted to jasmonic acid through several                      
              biochemical steps. Both linolenic acid and jasmonic acid are                   
              powerful inducers of the inhibitor genes when placed on leaf                   
              surfaces, indicating their involvement in the signalling pathway.              
              The research funded by this grant will seek the mechanism within               
              the plant membranes that releases linolenic acid  in response to               
              signals produced by insect or pathogen attacks and will establish              
              the biochemical  events leading to the synthesis of jasmonic acid.             
              The mechanism by which jasmonic acid can activate proteinase                   
              inhibitor gene expression in the plant cell nucleus will also be               
              studied. The fate of jasmonic acid and its receptor will be sought,            
              and its role in gene activation will be investigated. The                      
              information will be utilized to understand the biochemical basis               
              of inducible plant defenses against insects and pathogens.
