Abstract    :
              High resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) is a                
              highly surface sensitive method for determining surface                        
              vibrational modes.   This method can be used to identify                       
              surface chemistry, and in particular the bonding gemometry and                 
              molecular symmetry of surfaces and adsorbates on surfaces.                     
              Unfortunately the method fails when applied to substrates with                 
              a substantial ionic character such as metal oxides.   The                      
              project attempts to improve the applicability of HREELS to                     
              substrates with ionic character by use of a data analysis                      
              method that draws heavily on the Maximum Entropy Method from                   
              information theory.  The approach promises to be nonsubjective                 
              and widely applicable.

              This award is a Grant for Exploratory Research to support the                  
              research of Dr. Marjorie A. Langell of the University of                       
              Nebraska-Lincoln.  The research, in the general area of                        
              Analytical and Surface Chemistry, focuses on the application of                
              high resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy to metal                     
              oxides and other ionic surfaces.  The work promises to enhance                 
              the analytical potential of this type of spectroscopy, and thus                
              make an important contribution to the area of surface analysis.
