Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award provides partial support for the acquisition,                       
              maintenance, and authentication of plant virus collection at the               
              American Type Culture Collection (ATCC).  The ATCC plant virus                 
              collection maintains and distributes well-characterized plant                  
              viruses, viroids, antisera and molecularly cloned viruses.  With               
              this award, the ATCC will augment the various collection holdings              
              according to the interests and needs of the scientific community,              
              authenticate its holdings, upgrade documentation for all cultures              
              and enhance the plant virus collection database, and provide                   
              advice and information on the proper usage of the cultures.   The              
              ATCC Plant Virus Collection is recognized as an official                       
              repository for plant viral germplasm by the American                           
              Phytopathological Society and the International Committee on                   
              Taxonomy of Viruses of the International Union of Microbiological              
              Societies.
