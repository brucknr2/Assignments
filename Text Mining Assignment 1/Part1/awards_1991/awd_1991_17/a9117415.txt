Abstract    :
                   This award will provide half the funds necessary to upgrade               
              the rock mechanics laboratory at St. Louis University. The                     
              additional funding to make this possible has been committed by St.             
              Louis University. This will be an upgrade of equipment borrowed                
              from Texas A&M on a long term,renewable loan. The upgrade will                 
              involve the building of apparatus especially  designed by the PI               
              to carry out experiments of special interest to scientists studying            
              the behavior of materials in fault zones. The proposed upgrade                 
              involves construction of a computerized data acquisition and servo-            
              controlled system,a flow- through pore fluid system,a simplified               
              sealing and sample assembly,and a furnace and controller to achieve            
              elevated temperatures. Upgrade of the rock deformation apparatus               
              and laboratory will allow the development of a research program                
              that will involve graduate students and other researchers                      
              interested in the frictional and brittle behavior of rock in fault             
              zones under conditions that favor soluttion transfer and                       
              cataclastic mechanisms.
