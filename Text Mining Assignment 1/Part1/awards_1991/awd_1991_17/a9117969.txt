Abstract    :
              This award is for support of a project to study the concentration              
              and isotopic composition of O2, N2, and Ar in ice core trapped gas             
              samples, and to begin a program of CH4 measurements.  The transport            
              of air in the firn, and its implications for isotopic fractionation            
              during the trapping of gases and the chronology of ice core trapped            
              gas samples will be studied.  Samples from the Vostok, Byrd                    
              Station, and McMurdo Dome ice cores will be studied.  Results from             
              this study will lead to a better understanding of the sequence of              
              events associated with glaciations and deglaciations, estimates of             
              time leads and lags between these events, and the implications of              
              this information for mechanisms of Pleistocene climate change.                 
              This work will also contribute to efforts to understand how man has            
              changed greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere during the             
              last 200 years.
