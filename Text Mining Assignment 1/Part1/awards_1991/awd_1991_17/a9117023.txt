Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will support the participation of ten U.S. participants in          
              a U.S.-Japan Seminar on New Approaches to Developmental                        
              Endocrinology, to be held Janaury 11-15, 1993 in Honolulu.  The                
              co-organizers are Professor Christopher Brown, Hawaii Institute of             
              Marine Biology, and Professor Akihisa Urano, Ocean Research                    
              Institute, University of Tokyo.  The seminar will address the state            
              of understanding of the involvement of hormones in the regulation              
              of development.  Participants will include biologists working with a           
              wide range of organisms:  insects, fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds,          
              and mammals.                                                                   
                                                                                             
              Recent indications that signals from the endocrine system of the               
              developing embryo are supplemented by hormones of maternal                     
              origin has required some revision of prior thinking on this subject.           
              Researchers in the United States and Japan have figured                        
              importantly in this research.  The "new approaches" in the seminar             
              refer to both new concepts in the endocrinology of development                 
              and the application of new techniques.  The seminar will provide a             
              form for integrating recent findings and increasing the collaboration          
              among scientists in the two countries.
