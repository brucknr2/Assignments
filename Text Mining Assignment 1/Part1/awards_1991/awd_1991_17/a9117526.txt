Abstract    :
              The overall objective of this project is to examine how reduction              
              of dimensionality, electrostatic potentials, and other physical                
              factors affect the production of second messengers.                            
              Phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase Cs (PLC's), which are                  
              found both in the cytoplasm and the membrane hydrolyze                         
              phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), a lipid found on                 
              the cytoplasmic surface of cell membranes, to produce the second               
              messengers inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate and diacylgercerol.  The                
              working hypothesis is that PLC's bind to acidic lipids in                      
              biological membranes, producing a loss of dimensionality that                  
              increases the binding of the PLC's to other membrane proteins and              
              to their substrate, PIP2.  Preliminary work has demonstrated that              
              PLC's bind with high affinity to acidic lipids in phospholipid                 
              bilayers. Gel filtration, a novel centrifugation separation                    
              technique, microelectrophoresis, fluorescence quenching, stopped               
              flow, and surface radioactivity experiments will be used to                    
              measure the equilibrium and kinetic aspects of the binding with                
              phospholipid vesicles and monolayers.  The novel theoretical                   
              prediction that dimensionality and electrostatics can produce                  
              apparent cooperativity when basic residues on proteins bind to                 
              acidic lipids in membranes will be tested with small basic                     
              peptides and phospholipid vesicles.  Dialysis, filtration,                     
              mobility, fluorescence and stopped flow measurements will be used              
              to examine the equilibrium and kinetic aspects of the binding and              
              to search for lateral phase separation of acidic lipids.
