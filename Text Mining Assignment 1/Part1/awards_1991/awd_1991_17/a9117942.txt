Abstract    :
                   Recent discoveries of Silurian/early Devonian fossils in                  
              metamorphosed clastic rocks of the western Blue Ridge province,                
              southern Appalachians have called into question the prevailing                 
              views of Blue Ridge tectonic evolution.  The fossiliferous rocks               
              indicate that metamorphism must be Devonian or younger, whereas a              
              number of published radiometric ages indicate Ordovician                       
              metamorphism.  This study will resolve the extent and role of                  
              Taconic (Ordovician) versus Acadian (Devonian) metamorphism and                
              thus the discrepancies between the paleontologic and radiometric               
              data.  40Ar/39Ar and Rb/Sr geochronology will be used in two well-             
              studied areas to constrain the timing of metamorphism,                         
              mylonitization and thrusting.  The results of this study will                  
              resolve the current controversy surrounding the tectonic evolution             
              of the Blue Ridge crystalline rocks of the southern Appalachians.
