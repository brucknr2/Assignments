Abstract    :
              The principal investigator will study the thermodynamic mixing                 
              properties of felsic silicate melts, utilizing experimental and                
              theoretical techniques. The chemical systems to be studied are                 
              feldspar-quartz-iron silicate. The long-range goal is to further               
              our understanding of the role of phase equilibria in dictating the             
              genesis and evolution of felsic magmas.
