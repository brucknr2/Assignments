Abstract    :
                   Prior studies in the Kigluaik Mountains of the Seward                     
              Peninsula, Alaska have raised the possibility that Cretaceous                  
              granites were emplaced in a large-magnitude extension event, rather            
              than during a compressional, crustal thickening event as previously            
              thought.  This project involves age dating and chemical and                    
              isotopic petrogenetic studies to test between the two different                
              hypotheses.  Results will assist other studies in the area by                  
              providing age control, and will give insight into processes leading            
              to the production of granitic melts in several tectonic                        
              environments.
