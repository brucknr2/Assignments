Abstract    :
              This award is for funding of travel support for U.S. participants              
              in the 2nd International Symposium on Experimental Robotics                    
              (ISER), to be held in Toulous, France on 25-27 June, 1991.  The                
              Symposium is an important one in that it draws attention to the                
              issues in experimental validation of theoretical research in                   
              robotics, and has a wide international participation.  The NSF-                
              funded participants will each prepare a report on the findings of              
              the meeting, and their conclusions will be summariezed and                     
              submitted to a robotics publication.
