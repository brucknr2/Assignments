Abstract    :
              Proteins which bind to specific base sequences in DNA regulate                 
              the expression of many different genes.  Transcription factor                  
              TFIIIA, the prototype of the Zn-finger class of proteins, binds                
              strongly to a defined base sequence contained within the coding                
              region of 5S RNA genes.  This interaction represents the                       
              primary step in assembly of a transcriptionally active complex                 
              and, once assembled, these complexes persist through many                      
              rounds of transcription.  The objective of this research is an                 
              understanding of the molecular interactions between this                       
              protein and its target sequence during complex formation and                   
              transcription. To facilitate these studies, a photosensitive                   
              cross-linking reagent has been developed, 5-N3-deoxyuridine-5'-                
              triphosphate, which can be enzymatically incorporated into DNA                 
              in place of thymidine.  Photoactive DNA can be used to label                   
              sites or regions in proteins which are in close proximity to                   
              the DNA,  Contacts between purified TFIIIA and specific                        
              positions in the Xenopus.  5S, DNA internal control region have                
              been mapped.  This allows examination of the fine structure of                 
              this interaction to understand the recognition process,                        
              determine how it is affected by the presence of other                          
              transcription factors as well as RNA polymerase III, and look                  
              for changes which occur as the polymerase initiates RNA                        
              synthesis and traverses the TFIIIA contact sites.
