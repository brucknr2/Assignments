Abstract    :
              Nitrogen is an essential element for growth of a living cell and it            
              has been shown that nitrogen availability controls both the                    
              mitotoic and meiotic cell cycles in the yeast, Saccharomyces                   
              cerevisae.  A novel class of yeast mutants (aat1-3) has been                   
              isolated which have a range of growth phenotypes (inability to grow            
              on rich media, sensitivity to amino acid analogs, heat shock                   
              sensitivity) that are only evident when the cell also requires a               
              particular amino acid for growth; prototrophic strains containing              
              an aat mutation grow normally.  Amino acid transport is                        
              misregulated in these  strains and there is genetic evidence for a             
              close relationship between Aat proteins and the products of the                
              growth controls (RAS /cAMP) pathway.  A complete genetic analysis              
              of these mutants is proposed to elucidate their function in the                
              control of amino acid transport and to establish if the Aat                    
              proteins have a role in the control of cell growth and division by             
              nutrients availability.
