Abstract    :
              It is widely recognized that the earth's climate is dynamic and                
              that significant changes have occurred in the past.                            
              Paleoenvironmental records from ice cores are an important tool for            
              understanding the processes responsible for previous climate                   
              changes.  This award supports the measurement of the electrical                
              conductivity of an ice core that will be drilled at McMurdo Dome,              
              Antarctica in 1992-1993.  Specific objectives of this proposal are:            
              (1) to assist in determining the age/depth relation for the McMurdo            
              Dome core and to provide the location of stratigraphic marker                  
              horizons; (2) to identify segments of the core that have anomalous             
              chemical characteristics so that other research groups can direct              
              their efforts to significant, short duration features and; (3)                 
              provide a record of the volcanic activity that has affected the                
              area.
