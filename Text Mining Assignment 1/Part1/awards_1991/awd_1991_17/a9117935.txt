Abstract    :
                   This proposal requests funds for a detailed study of the                  
              tectonic evolution and depositional history of Permian sedimentary             
              rocks on the Central Basin Platform, Permian Basin.  The Central               
              Basin Platform (CBP) is similar to other foreland uplifts.  The                
              results from an integrated study of Permian sequence stratigraphic             
              relationships across the platform, geophysical data, and                       
              quantitative subsidence analyses will provide important information            
              about the tectonic origin and depositional history of this complex             
              structure.  This study also will present an unique intrabasinal                
              test of sequence stratigraphic concepts.                                       
                   The objectives of the proposed research are:  1) to determine             
              the late Paleozoic tectonic evolution of the CBP through detailed              
              analysis of pre-Leonardian structures and uplift history of the                
              CBP; 2) to better constrain tectonic models for the origin of the              
              Permian Basin area; 3) to integrate structural analyses of the CBP             
              into larger-scale models of the tectonic evolution of the Marathon-            
              Ouachita foreland and the Ancestral Rocky Mountains; 4) to                     
              determine the Permian subsidence history along several east-west               
              transects across the CBP and adjacent parts of the Midland and                 
              Delaware Basins; 5) to determine the relative effects of                       
              subsidence, eustasy, sedimentation rate, and paleogeographic                   
              position of the evolution of Permian depositional facies from the              
              platform interior and across platform-to-basin transitions around              
              the CBP; 6) to identify the controls that pre-Premian structures               
              of the CBP have on Permian subsidence history and facies                       
              architecture; 7) to develop a better understanding of the origin               
              of foreland uplifts and their response to convergence events; and              
              8) to relate all the of the above objectives to future hydrocarbon             
              exploration and production strategies on the CBP.
