Abstract    :
                   This award provides for approximately 17% of the total amount             
              necessary to acquire an electron microprobe. The remaining 83% will            
              be supplied by the University of Hawaii(40%),NASA(25%),and NSF-                
              OCE(17%). This state-of-the-art electron microprobe will replace               
              a 12 year old instrument,which lacks the imaging capabilities,beam             
              stability,and computer strength needed for modern research. An                 
              excellent group of researchers with wide ranging interests will                
              benefit from this acquisition.
