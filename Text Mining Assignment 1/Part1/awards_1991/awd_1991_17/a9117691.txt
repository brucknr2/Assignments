Abstract    :
              It is proposed a gas aggregation method for synthesis                          
              of useful amounts of size-selected nanoscale clusters                          
              and to explore the assembly of such clusters into                              
              potentially novel materials.  One goal of the proposed                         
              research is to develop the aerosol source capable of                           
              producing kilograms per hour of the nanoscale metal                            
              and metal oxide clusters and to demonstrate practical                          
              methods for recovery and accumulation of these                                 
              particles.  A second goal is to develop atomic force                           
              microscopy methods to measure the forces exerted by                            
              nanoscale clusters on each other and between these                             
              particles and solid substrates.  Molecular dynamics                            
              simulations will also be performed to interpret the                            
              experimental results that will be obtained.                                    
                                                                                             
              The proposed approach may lead to new products                                 
              and processes for advanced materials.
