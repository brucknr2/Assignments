Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Grossman plans to combine data from different remote sensor               
              platforms with more conventional data and turbulent flux                       
              measurements in the 1992 STORMFEST experiment.  STORMFEST's primary            
              scientific goals are first, to field-test new mesoscale observing              
              and forecasting systems in preparation for later major field                   
              experiments of the U.S. Weather Research Program; and second, to               
              study the mesoscale structures of winter frontal and precipitation             
              synoptic scale flow in which they are embedded.  His objective is              
              to quantitatively describe the structure of the Planetary Boundary             
              Layer (PBL) in a 50-km square nested within the larger scale                   
              experimental array.  The data will provide estimates of fluxes and             
              profiles over the diurnal cycle, in a variety of meteorological                
              situations, with varying cloud cover.  The database can later be               
              used by other investigators in conjunction with other experimental             
              (numerical large-eddy simulation) data to comparatively evaluate               
              the various PBL parameterizations currently in use in GCM and                  
              climate models, and, it is hoped, lead to improved versions of                 
              these.
