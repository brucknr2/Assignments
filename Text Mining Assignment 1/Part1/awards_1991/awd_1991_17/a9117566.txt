Abstract    :
                   Cosmogenic chlorine-36 buildup dating is a new                            
              geochronological method that measures how long a rock has been                 
              exposed to cosmic rays on the earth's surface, rather than the                 
              time since it became a geochemically closed system.  The method                
              can thus be used to date the construction of landforms, such as                
              glacial moraines, that are difficult or impossible to date using               
              conventional methods.  This award supports glacial chronology                  
              investigations by cosmogenic 36Cl buildup at four locations (1)                
              measurements on samples from Mauna Kea, (2) the Wind River Range,              
              Wyoming, (3) Banks Island, NWT. Canada, and (4) one other site in              
              the High Arctic.  These sites will provide a latitudinal transect              
              of the northern hemisphere to test whether the chronological                   
              pattern previously observed at Hawaii and the Sierra Nevada was                
              due to coincidental local anomalies or to truly global climate                 
              effects.  One potential implication of a positive result would be              
              that the growth of continental-scale ice caps may be more a                    
              response to internal dynamics than global climate forcing.
