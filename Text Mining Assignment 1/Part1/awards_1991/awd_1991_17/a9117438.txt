Abstract    :
              The principal investigator, in collaboration with Dr. Roger Nielsen            
              of Oregon State University, will study the partitioning of rare                
              earth elements between pyroxene minerals and melts over a wide                 
              range of temperatures and pressures. The data will provide                     
              important information to geologists who are attempting to                      
              understand the origin and evolution of igneous rocks and magmas.
