Abstract    :
              This project proposes to examine two areas of contrasting Fe-P                 
              mineralization in the mid-Mesozoic of the northern Great Basin and             
              compare them with results from ongoing cooperative studies of the              
              Proterozoic Fe-P deposits in southeastern Missouri.  Areas for                 
              selected study are: (1) the Humboldt Lopolith (western Nevada);                
              (2) the Cortez Mountains (central Nevada); and (3) the granite-                
              rhyolite terrane of the St. Francois Mountains.  It is planned to:             
              (1) characterize selected deposits, associated alteration, and                 
              related magmatism, (2) evaluate the conditions of formation and the            
              sources of components, and (3) investigate reasons for similarities            
              and differences.  Selective mapping and sample collection will be              
              followed by petrographic and geochemical work.                                 
              The Missouri portion of this project extends a joint effort with               
              the Missouri DLGS and USGS to understand mid-continent "Olympic                
              Dam" systems.  Radiogenic isotopic analyses (Sr, Nd, Pb) from well-            
              characterized samples will be used to:  (1) improve geochronometry             
              of mineralization, and (2) help resolve sources of components and              
              mechanisms of ore formation.  Regional stable-isotope studies (O,              
              H, S) and selected radiogenic isotopic analyses will investigate               
              the timing, distribution, and intensity of hydrothermal systems and            
              their relationship to mineralization.  The Missouri and Nevada                 
              investigations combine two complementary ongoing efforts with the              
              long-term aim of quantitatively interpreting the genesis of Fe-P               
              deposits.
