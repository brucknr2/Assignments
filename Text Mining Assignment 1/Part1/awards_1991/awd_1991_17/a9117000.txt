Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Convergent margins have been shown to be of two types.                         
              Accretionary margins reflect the addition of sedimentary material              
              to an overriding crustal plate during underthrusting of oceanic                
              crust.  Erosional margins reflect tectonic stripping of crustal                
              material and its transport to depth by the underthrusting ocean                
              crust.  Understanding the reasons for these two types of margins is            
              critical in determining global sedimentary mass balances, element              
              cycling between the crust and mantle, and may shed light on the                
              features and processes which create earthquakes along convergent               
              margins.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              The present award will support examination of the Chile margin, a              
              region of intense erosion produced by the underthrusting of an                 
              active spreading center.  Specifically, multi-channel seismic                  
              reflection data will be processed from an undisturbed section of               
              the margin and compared to detailed analysis of data from a highly             
              eroded section.  Comparison of these data sets will provide a                  
              unique picture of temporal changes in margin structure and erosion.
