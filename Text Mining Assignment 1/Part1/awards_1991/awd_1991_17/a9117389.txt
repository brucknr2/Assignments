Abstract    :
              The principal investigator will carry out theoretical and                      
              experimental lattice dynamical studies of aluminium and magnesium              
              silicate materials, with a view towards the determination of                   
              thermodynamic properties from their atomic vibration                           
              characteristics. The dynamics of phase transitions in anorthite                
              and in enstatite also will be investigated. This work should result            
              in a better understanding of the links between the microscopic                 
              characteristics and the macroscopic behavior of these materials.
