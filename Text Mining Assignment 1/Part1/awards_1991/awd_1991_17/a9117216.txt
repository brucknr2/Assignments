Abstract    :
              This research project is an interdisciplinary study to identify                
              and to quantify biological chemicals that affect ecological                    
              relationships among benthic antarctic marine invertebrates.  This              
              research is a continuation of a program that succeeded in                      
              documenting a moderate incidence of chemical influence on                      
              ecological relationships in polar communities, contrary to                     
              contemporary theory that suggests an inverse relationship between              
              latitude and incidence of chemical defense.  This project extends              
              the scope of that earlier study by addressing the chemical nature              
              of defensive agents.  The objectives are to isolate and to                     
              characterize biologically active chemicals from previously                     
              identified invertebrates with chemical defense mechanisms.  The                
              goals are to evaluate the role of these chemicals as feeding                   
              deterrents, anti-fouling agents or overgrowth inhibitory                       
              chemicals, to determine the biological origin of these chemical                
              metabolites, and to examine the storage of defensive agents in                 
              specific tissues or mucus.  Ecologically significant bioassays                 
              will guide the analytical isolation and characterization of                    
              identified defense metabolites.  The proposed research will                    
              enhance our understanding and significance of defense metabolites              
              in the ecology of antarctic marine benthos, a changing paradigm.
