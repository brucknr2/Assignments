Abstract    :
              It is proposed to experimentally test and improve the photon                   
              "correlation transfer" theory for particle characterization in                 
                                                                                             
              optically dense suspensions.  The theory has been developed by                 
                                                                                             
              the co-P.I.s during the NSF grant CTS-8907149, and is a                        
              significant advancement in the field.  The basic concept of                    
              the photon correlation theory is similar to the radiative                      
              transfer theory for the transport of light through multiple                    
              scattering media.  A variety of experimental condition will be                 
                                                                                             
              considered, such as anisotropically scattering particles,                      
              polarization and various optical densities.                                    
                                                                                             
              The proposed method has potential commercial applications for                  
              monitoring particle characteristics in multiphase processing                   
              industries, at low and high concentration of solids.
