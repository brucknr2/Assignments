Abstract    :
                This research will address the determination of down-dip slip                
              distribution on fault surfaces during large earthquakes.  This                 
              has been a difficult problem in the past because of limitations                
              in the bandwidth of seismic instrumentation.  This technique will              
              be to use recorded tsunamis for oceanic earthquakes, along with                
              any land-based geodetic data, to constrain the down-dip                        
              earthquake slips.  Earthquakes that will be investigated are the               
              1944 Tonankai and the 1946 Nankaido earthquakes along the Nankai               
              Trough, Japan, the 1923 Kanto, Japan, earthquake, the 1964 Alaska              
              earthquake, and the 1960 Chilean earthquake.  This research is a               
              component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
