Abstract    :
                Visualization tools are being developed to allow the                         
              scientists,                                                                    
              teachers and students to view and manipulate representations of                
              the                                                                            
              ocean floor directly on the screens of their desktop computers.                
              Many different types of pictures can be examined, including maps,              
              perspective views, pseudocolor imagery, shaded relief diagrams                 
              and                                                                            
              3-D stereograms. The raw data from which the views are created                 
              include bathymetry from multibeam and phase intererometric sonars              
              and backscatter from side-looking sonars. Using electronic                     
              communication over Internet, the users connect from their                      
              computer                                                                       
              (the server) into a client computer at Columbia University to                  
              begin                                                                          
              the visualization session. The client returns to the user with                 
              menus and dialog boxes for the purpose of selecting the display                
              type, map boundaries, color tables, fonts, data files, etc..                   
              Moments later the representation appears in a window on the                    
              user's                                                                         
              screen with computations run in the client computer. The user,                 
              given a responsive, intuitive and interactive interface, is                    
              liberated from the chores of locating and maintaining large                    
              complex                                                                        
              databases and software code. The users find their work                         
              accelerated                                                                    
              by an immediate response to a query and by a greater depth of                  
              understanding from advanced graphic representations of very large              
              datasets.
