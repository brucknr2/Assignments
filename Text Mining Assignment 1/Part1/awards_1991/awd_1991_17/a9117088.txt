Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is the formation of polycyclic ring                 
              systems by the interaction of alpha-diazo alkynyl substituted                  
              ketones with various transition metals.  The initially formed                  
              ketocarbenoid intermediate is projected to undergo an                          
              intramolecular addition to the acetylenic pi-bond to produce a                 
              vinylcarbenoid intermediate.  The latter will be probed to                     
              study the potential for insertion into C-H bonds, addition to                  
              pi-bonds, 1,2-hydrogen and alkyl group migration and                           
              electrocyclization.

              With this award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting                   
              the research of Dr. Albert Padwa of the Department of Chemistry                
              at Emory University.  Professor Padwa will focus his work on                   
              the development of new synthetic methods for the production of                 
              carbenoid intermediates and, thus, the preparation of unusual                  
              polycyclic ring systems.
