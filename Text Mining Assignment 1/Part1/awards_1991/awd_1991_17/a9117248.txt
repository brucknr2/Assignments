Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal requests funds to support a study of the mechanisms              
              that regulate the concentration of the intracellular osmolyte,                 
              glycine betaine, in response to hyperosmotic stress. Glycine                   
              betaine is an extremely common and important osmolyte in a wide                
              variety of species ranging from bacteria to plants and animals.                
              Although a great deal is known about the salinity induced                      
              regulation of glycine betaine in bacteria, far less is known about             
              its regulation in plants and even less in animals. We have found               
              that oysters (Cassostrea virginica) from the Atlantic coast utilize            
              substantial amounts of glycine betaine to regulate intracellular               
              osmotic concentrations following hyperosmotic stress. Conspecific              
              oysters from the Chesapeake Bay have much smaller levels of glycine            
              betaine that do not change following high salinity stress, and the             
              Bay oysters are not as salinity tolerant. Since the mitochondrion              
              is usually the site of  glycine betaine synthesis, these results               
              suggest that these two populations of oysters differ at the                    
              mitochondrial level. This proposal contains experiments designed               
              to test that possibility by comparing several aspects of the                   
              mechanism of salinity induced glycine betaine synthesis between the            
              Bay and Atlantic oysters. The results will contribute a great deal             
              to the understanding of glycine betaine regulation and, in                     
              addition, should resolve whether the differences between the oyster            
              populations are genetic or environmentally founded.
