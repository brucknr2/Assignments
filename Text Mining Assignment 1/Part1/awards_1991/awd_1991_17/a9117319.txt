Abstract    :
                This grant is to partially fund a workshop on low frequency                  
              electrical precursors to earthquakes.  Intense interest in this                
              phenomena was generated in the 1970s by Chinese reports of                     
              electrical changes prior to earthquakes; major efforts are still               
              underway in China.  Other research efforts throughout the world,               
              including the U.S., have had mixed results in confirming the                   
              existence of precursors, and matching the anomalous signal to a                
              realistic physical model.  A recent example is the reported 0.01               
              to 10 Hz magnetic anomaly before the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake.              
              It is appropriate to review this subject with the major                        
              international scientists working in the field and produce a                    
              report of the status and recommended research on electrical                    
              earthquake precursors.  This research is a component of the                    
              National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
