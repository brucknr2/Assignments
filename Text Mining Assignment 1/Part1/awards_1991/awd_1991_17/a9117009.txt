Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will support a two-year U.S.-Japan cooperative science              
              project between Professor Julius Rebek, Department of Chemistry,               
              Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Professor Kenji Koga,               
              Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Tokyo.  The                  
              project involves the investigation of catalytic proton transfer agents         
              for asymmetric chemical synthesis.  This cooperative effort seeks              
              to develop the techniques and understanding of factors governing               
              the stereoelectronics of protonation and deprotonation.  This will             
              require a focus on both the proton source as well as the trajectory            
              of proton transfer.  Professor Rebek has performed extensive                   
              studies of stereoelectronic effects at carboxyl function and the               
              chemistry of molecular recognition.  Professor Koga has a program              
              in asymmetric deprotonation reactions and the chemistry of lithiated           
              amine bases.  Their collaboration in this project draws on the                 
              complementarity of their research programs.
