Abstract    :
              Research will be undertaken in order to develop new theoretical and            
              computational techniques and software for determining the                      
              structural, electronic and magnetic properties of bulk solids,                 
              surfaces and interfaces.  Specific projects include (1) the                    
              development of fully relativistic moment polarized thin film Full              
              Potential Linearized Augmented Plane Wave method and software for              
              carrying out relativistic studies of magnetism, magnetic anisotropy            
              and magneto-optical studies on surfaces and interfaces; (2) methods            
              for calculating forces acting on atoms using the techniques                    
              developed in (1); (3) the development of the density functional                
              coupled channel equation approach into a sophisticated                         
              computational method which can be used efficiently as the starting             
              point for the next steps in solving the many-body problem with                 
              other techniques (including the quantum Monte Carlo method).                   
              Unique features of (3) include the ability to solve the energy band            
              problem in more than three-dimensions which may be useful in                   
              describing quasi-crystals.                                                     
              %%%                                                                            
              Continued research will be done on the magnetic properties of bulk,            
              surface and interfacial magnetism based on calculations of the                 
              electronic structure.  Additional work will be done on the                     
              development of computational techniques which will facilitate the              
              efficient and accurate calculations of these properties.  The group            
              at Northwestern is one of the international leaders doing this type            
              of work.
