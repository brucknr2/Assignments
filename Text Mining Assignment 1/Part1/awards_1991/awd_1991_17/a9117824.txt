Abstract    :
                   This project will evaluate data in support of the existence               
              of a large island in northernmost Sonora during the Mesozoic.                  
              Preliminary data suggests that the island was surrounded by                    
              relatively deep marine environments, rather than the shallow marine            
              and fluvial environments postulated by previous workers.  The data             
              will delineate the disposition of land masses along the                        
              southwestern margin of North America during the Cretaceous.  The               
              results will have important tectonic implications for the evolution            
              of southwestern North America.
