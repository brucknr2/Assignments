Abstract    :
              Marine geological and geophysical studies of the Ross Sea and                  
              Weddell Sea continental shelves provide evidence that the ice sheet            
              grounded near the shelf edge in these areas during the late                    
              Wisconsinan, and that the retreat of the ice sheet to its present              
              position was rapid and probably episodic.  This Award supports a               
              project which will establish the most recent (late                             
              Wisconsin-Holocene) history of ice sheet advance and retreat in                
              Ross Sea.  The objectives include: 1) reconstruction the late                  
              Wisconsin paleodrainage regime, including ice stream drainage                  
              divides; 2) reconstruction of former grounding zone positions; 3)              
              constraint of the timing of ice sheet retreat from the shelf; and              
              4) acquisition of geophysical, sedimentological, and                           
              paleontological data which may provide indicators of the                       
              environmental factors that may have influenced to ice sheet                    
              retreat.  This is a joint effort between Rice University, the                  
              University of Colorado, and Hamilton College.  The project involves            
              experts in a wide variety of fields, and will interface with                   
              glaciologists, physical oceanographers, and climatologists who will            
              address the problem of ice sheet stability and the record of                   
              climatic and glaciological change.
