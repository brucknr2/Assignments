Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will support a two-year U.S.-Japan Cooperative                      
              Photoconversion/Photosynthesis Research Program project between                
              Professor Anastasios Melis, Department of Plant Biology,                       
              University of California Berkeley, and Professor Yoshihiko Fujita,             
              Department of Cell Biology, National Institute for Basic Biology,              
              Okazaki, Japan.  The project will focus on the mechanism by                    
              which plants and algae are capable of adjusting both the size of               
              their photosynthetic units in photosystem-II (PSII) and photosystem-           
              I (PSI), as well as the ratio of PSII/PSI in response to differences           
              in the quality of illumination.  Such ajustments constantly optimize           
              the photosynthetic capability of whole plants or plant parts and               
              even whole ecosystems.  This is a very important question.                     
                                                                                             
              The collaboration will help combine the use of resources in                    
              elucidating the molecular mechanism that regulates photosystem                 
              stoichiometry adjustments in chloroplasts.  In particular, the                 
              research will address the processes of signal perception and signal            
              transduction in the chloroplasts leading to photosystem                        
              stoichiometry adjustments, and on different aspects of the                     
              regulation of gene expression by light-quality and nutrient                    
              availability in photosynthetic prokaryotes and higher plants.
