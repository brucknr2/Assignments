Abstract    :
                   The North American Cordillera contains a number of exotic                 
              terranes that were accreted to the continental margin during late              
              Mesozoic to Tertiary time.  Study has focused on those Terranes                
              presently found in the northern part of the Cordillera in the                  
              Pacific northwest and Canada.  One of the largest such Terranes                
              however, is the Guerrero Terrane of western Mexico and is the                  
              subject of this project.  The Terrane consists of Jurassic-                    
              Cretaceous submarine lavas volcaniclastics, and sedimentary rocks.             
              The project will include mapping, isotopic characterization and                
              radiometric age dating.  These and other data will be integrated               
              to constrain models of mesozoic paleogeography of the western                  
              margin of North America and the role of Guerrero Terrane and its               
              accretion.
