Abstract    :
              In plate tectonic reconstructions the Caribbean Plate (area of                 
              present-day Caribbean Sea and West Indies) is assumed to have                  
              originated in the Pacific and was, in fact, a part of the Pacific              
              Farallon Plate during Mesozoic times.  We plan to examine ophiolite            
              masses (remnants of oceanic crust) to determine the genesis and age            
              of the Caribbean Plate.  Clues to the origin and actual oldest age             
              of the Caribbean Plate can be found by examining microfossils                  
              (Radiolaria) occurring in cherts within ophiolite remnants in the              
              West Indies.  It is conceivable that remnants of older ophiolite               
              complexes are present that pre-date the formation of the Atlantic              
              and the Gulf of Mexico and that contain a radiolarian assemblage               
              having a unique paleolatitudinal imprint.
