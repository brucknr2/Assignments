Abstract    :
              Professor Larry A. Viehland is supported by a grant from the                   
              Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to study the                   
              way diatomic ions move through dilute gases under the influence                
              of electric fields.  The appropriate Boltzmann-like kinetic                    
              equation will be solved in order to systemmatically approximate                
              the ion mobility and diffusion coefficients for comparison with                
              experiments.  The calculations will be extended to the                         
              determination of the ion velocity distribution functions.  This                
              will allow calculation of the reaction rate coefficients                       
              measured in swarm experiments and provide an assessment of the                 
              accuracy of our knowledge of diatomic ion/molecule reaction                    
              cross sections.                                                                
              %%%                                                                            
              A thorough understanding of interaction between ions and                       
              neutral molecules is important in such fields as atomic and                    
              molecular physics, aeronomy and atmospheric chemistry, gaseous                 
              electronics, and laser physics.  Viehland studies the mobility                 
              and diffusion of ions moving through trace amounts of dilute                   
              gases under the influence of an electric field.  These                         
              conditions are frequently encountered in laboratories where ion                
              molecule reactions are studied.
