Abstract    :
                This grant is for support of participants at a winter Gordon                 
              Conference on Sensory Transduction in Microorganisms.  The                     
              conference, which is anticipated to have 110-135 attendees, will               
              permit scientists from the United States and abroad to discuss                 
              recent developments and ideas regarding molecular mechanisms of                
              sensory transduction in simple unicellular systems including                   
              bacteria, yeast, flagellates, and Dictyostelium.  Sessions will                
              emphasize the emerging generalizations regarding chemosensory and              
              photosensory receptors, intramolecular transduction, intracellular             
              signal processing, and the response processes, ranging from                    
              flagellar or pseudopod modulation in tactic cells to gene                      
              expression in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms.                       
              Homologies between microbial and higher animal signal transduction             
              components will be emphasized.                                                 
                                                                                             
              Sensory signal transduction is the key to the ability of an                    
              organism to perceive and respond appropriately to its environment.             
              The mechanisms by which microbes perceive and respond to                       
              environmental stimuli are fascinating in their own right, and                  
              crucial to the survival of microbial species.  In addition, they               
              provide important clues to mechanims whereby higher organisms, both            
              plant and animal, likewise perceive and respond appropriately to               
              environmental stimuli.
