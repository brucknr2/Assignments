Abstract    :
              In this project, the PI's will analyze data from the Tropical                  
              Instability Wave Experiment (TIWE) carried out near 140|W just                 
              north of the equator in 1990-1991.  This proposal focuses on small             
              scale structure derived from fast sampling of temperature,                     
              salinity, and velocity, along with small-scale arrays of surface               
              drifters and ship-board air-sea flux measurements.  This work will             
              focus on the study of the local vorticity balance and heat flux                
              associated with the mingling of waters across the TIW front.
