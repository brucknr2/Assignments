Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                Our previous work has demonstrated that Electron Spin Resonance             
              (ESR) is a simple and highly sensitive method to investigate,                  
              through changes in the Gd3+ spectra, the magnetic ordering of the              
              CuO2 planes in the parent compounds of the copper oxide                        
              superconductors.  We propose to extend our research to the doped               
              derivatives that are superconducting.                                          
                                                                                             
                                         % % %                                               
                                                                                             
                Owing to the strong magnetic correlations in these compounds, it             
              is likely that the microscopic specificity of ESR will be an                   
              important contributor to the eventual explanation of high-                     
              temperature superconductivity.
