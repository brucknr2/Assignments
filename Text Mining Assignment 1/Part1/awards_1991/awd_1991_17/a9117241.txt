Abstract    :
              This study will systematically characterize the origins of volcanic            
              breccias and their constituent fragments, and thus develop a new               
              genetic classification scheme using mostly field-based                         
              observational criteria.  Integrated field and laboratory studies               
              will be undertaken in two phases.  Phase I studies will focus on               
              well- exposed breccias, mostly on Quaternary volcanoes, where field            
              relationships permit relatively unambiguous interpretation of                  
              deposit and particle origins.  These reference sites will emphasize            
              those types of volcanic breccias that are least well understood.               
              Phase II investigations will take place on well-exposed,                       
              accessible, and mapped volcanoes (one active, one Tertiary in age)             
              to evaluate how breccias of different types are distributed within             
              volcanic edifices, and the role that breccias play in the growth               
              of the volcano.
