Abstract    :
              The principal investigators will study the effect of deformation               
              on fluid inclusions. They will first generate inclusions under                 
              hydrostatic conditions, then subject the inclusions to plastic                 
              deformation. These data will be critical to those geologists who               
              use fluid inclusions to interpret the history of rocks which have              
              undergone deformation.
