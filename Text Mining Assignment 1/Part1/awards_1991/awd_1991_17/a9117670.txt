Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A Gordon Research Conference on the hormone Prolactin will be held             
              in Casa Sirena Marina Hotel, Oxnard, California on February 3-7,               
              1992.  This  conference has been ongoing every two years since                 
              1980, and has been drawing an audience of 110-130 participants.                
              These include graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and                     
              academic, government and industrial scientist form the USA and                 
              abroad who share a common interest in the various aspects of the               
              hormone.  About half of the participants has attended every                    
              Prolactin Gordon Conference since it inception.  The participants              
              including the invited speakers and discussion leaders, are expected            
              to stay in the meeting for the entire five days duration.                      
                                                                                             
              Because of the unique evolutionary aspects of prolactin an its many            
              biological functions, the conference is of interest to an broad                
              range of scientists, from a variety of disciplines.  In accordance             
              with the long tradition of the Gordon Research Conferences, the                
              emphasis is on presentation of recent, unpublished observations,               
              followed by long and probing discussions.  Such a format fosters               
              interactions between scientists from different disciplines and                 
              geographical locations and enables the field to remain progressive             
              and viable.  There is no other scientific meeting which fulfills               
              this function.                                                                 
                                                                                             
              The conference is consisted of eight scientific sessions, 2-3                  
              poster sessions, a banquet speaker, a business session, several                
              informal meetings of groups with common interests and 2-3 social               
              functions.
