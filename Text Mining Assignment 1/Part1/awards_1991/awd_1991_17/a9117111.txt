Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                     This renewal grant will assess the role of the Southern                
              Ocean in changing the vertical nutrient tracer distributions                   
              during the last glacial maximum and the last deglaciation.  To                 
              understand this completely, one must understand the role of the                
              North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) on the Antarctic Intermediate                 
              Water (AAIW).  According, the chemical history of pure (AAIW)                  
              will be reconstructed using cores collected off the western                    
              Tasmanian slope.  A number of key points can be answered,                      
              including the amount of CO2 pumped to the atmosphere via the                   
              AAIW, the history of the Southern Ocean nutrient chemistry and                 
              production can be evaluated, etc.
