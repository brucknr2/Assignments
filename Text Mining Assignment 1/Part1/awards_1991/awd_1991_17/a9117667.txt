Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The PI's will delineate the involvement of intermediate water             
              circulation changes in relation to the initiation of northern                  
              hemisphere glaciation by monitoring "middle" Pliocene circulation              
              in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans with benthic foraminifera C-13              
              comparisons. Three depth transect will be used to reconstruct                  
              intermediate water during the middle Pliocene: the Rio Grande Rise             
              (DSDP Leg 72), the Queensland Plateau (Leg 133) and the Bahamas.
