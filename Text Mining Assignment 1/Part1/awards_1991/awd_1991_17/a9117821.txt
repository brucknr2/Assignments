Abstract    :
              The primary goals of this study are:  (1) to examine in detail the             
              long-term petrologic, geochemical, and isotopic evolution of                   
              Kilauea and (2) to evaluate the nature of isotopic and geochemical             
              heterogeneities in the Hawaiian plume source.  The SOH core                    
              presents a unique opportunity to document the magmatic history of              
              the world's most active volcano and to examine in detail the                   
              geochemical evolution of a Hawaiian shield volcano over a                      
              significant portion of its eruptive activity.  Furthermore, Sr and             
              Pb isotopic systematics for Kilauea indicate this volcano best                 
              defines one end-member in the plume source of Hawaiian lavas.                  
              Therefore, results from this study should yield important new                  
              insights into the nature of geochemical heterogeneity in the                   
              Hawaiian mantle plume.
