Abstract    :
                   This award will provide approximately half the funds needed               
              to acquire an automated X-ray diffractometer. The additional funds             
              necessary for this acquisition have been committed by the                      
              University of Wyoming. This instrument will be one of the central              
              analytical instruments to enable ongoing research in                           
              geochemistry,clay mineralogy, and clastic diagenesis within the                
              Geology Department. It will also be used by faculty and students               
              engaged in studies of mineral assemblages in igneous and                       
              metamorphic rocks. Researchers in soil and environmental chemistry             
              are also expected to be users. This new automated instrument will              
              replace old diffractometers which are no longer capable of                     
              performing up to today's standards. This new diffractometer will               
              also make it possible to teach undergraduates and graduates in                 
              mineralogy and petrology courses with state-of-the-art                         
              instrumentation. A full-time experienced staff member will be                  
              responsible for instrument maintenance and will train and assist               
              users.
