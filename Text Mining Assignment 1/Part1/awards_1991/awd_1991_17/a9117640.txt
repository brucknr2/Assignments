Abstract    :
              Sierra Negra and Cerro Azul Volcanoes make up the southern end of              
              Isabela Island in the Galapagos Archipelago. Preliminary                       
              observations suggest that these volcanoes are also fundamentally               
              different, with Cerro Azul's lavas being the most primitive and                
              Alcedo's strongly bimodal.  Detailed field studies supplemented by             
              geochronology will establish the eruptive history of the volcanoes.            
              Geochemical and petrologic study will be used to determine the                 
              petrologic processes responsible for the diversity at the two                  
              volcanoes.  These data will add further insight into the volcanic              
              and petrologic evolution of Galapagos volcanoes and oceanic                    
              volcanism in general.
