Abstract    :
                   The Borborema tectonic province in northern Brazil formed                 
              during the 600 Ma convergence of the West African, Amazonian and               
              San Francisco-Congo cratons to form the ancient supercontinent of              
              Gondwanaland.  Because of the strong tectonic overprint at 600 Ma              
              it has been difficult to identify pre-Gondwana tectonic boundaries             
              within Borborema province.  This study will provide U/Pb age                   
              determinations for key lithologic suites and magmatic events and,              
              together with ongoing geologic mapping by Brazilian colleagues,                
              will allow the tectonic boundaries to be delineated.  The results              
              will provide much improved understanding of the pre-600 Ma tectonic            
              history and assembly of Gondwanaland, and will contribute to key               
              concepts of continental growth during the                                      
              Precambrian.//
