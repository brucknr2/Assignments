Abstract    :
              This project is the continuation of the South Pole Air Shower                  
              Experiment (SPASE), a large phased array of scintillation detectors            
              which was installed in 1988 to search the southern sky for                     
              astrophysical sources of ultra-high energy (100 GeV) gamma rays.               
              SPASE has been upgraded every year since its installation, but to              
              date has not found convincing evidence for a strong source, a                  
              result that is consistent with similar detectors elsewhere.  This              
              one year grant will allow SPASE to operate in conjunction with a               
              new muon detector which has just been installed at South Pole.                 
                                                                                             
              This project is a collaboration between Bartol Research Institute              
              of the University of Delaware and Leeds University in the United               
              Kingdom.
