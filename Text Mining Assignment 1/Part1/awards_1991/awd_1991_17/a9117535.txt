Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              In this application Dr. Davidson proposes to capitalize on recent              
              discoveries made in our lab in respect to the molecular basis of               
              bindin-receptor interaction.  The species specificity of                       
              fertilization in certain sympatic sea urchin species depends on                
              molecular recognition of the acrosomal bindin protein by egg                   
              receptor.  Previously he has cloned bindin mRNAs and compared the              
              bindin protein sequences from several species of sea urchin, and               
              we have recently identified specific short regions of the protein              
              that are apparently engaged in contact with the receptor, and that             
              are at least in part responsible for the species specificity of the            
              interaction.  Here he proposes a series of new experiments: i, we              
              will generate transgenic S. purpuratus expressing S. franciscanus              
              bindin to determine whether presentation of the bindin sequence per            
              se will promote interspecific fertilization; ii, he will also test             
              in vivo the functional significance of alterations in specific                 
              regions of bindin sequence; iii, he will determine the polymorphism            
              of the bindin/receptor interaction in S.franciscanus in order to               
              understand how speciation might have come about; iv, he will carry             
              out studies on the interaction of recombinant mutant bindin                    
              fragments with the receptor fragment recently described by Foltz               
              and Lennarz; v, he will investigate incorporation of exogenous                 
              bindin (and other) genes in growing spermatocytes in culture, and              
              determine whether transgenic spermatocytes can mature into                     
              functional sperm in culture.
