Abstract    :
              Six unusual coenzymes (methanofuran, tetrahydromethanopterin,                  
              coenzyme M. nickle tetrapyrrole F430, deazaflavin F420, and 7-                 
              mercaptoheptanolythreonine phosphate) so far have been discovered              
              to be required for the reduction of carbon dioxide the methane.                
              The present project continue studies on the terminal reactions of              
              this process, methyl group transfer and reduction to methane.  The             
              protein known as component C is now clearly established as the                 
              methylreductase (MR).  Special interests are:  How does the cell               
              maintain MR in the active state?                                               
              %%%                                                                            
              Methanogenic bacteria (methanogens) are archaebacteria and                     
              represent an ancient divergence in evolution.  An interesting                  
              aspect of this divergence is that the biochemistry of                          
              methanogenesis has remained isolated in the methanogens, a                     
              characteristic not shared by other living things.  The                         
              uniqueness of this biochemistry is dramatically shown by the                   
              six unusual coenzymes that so far have been discovered to be                   
              required for the reduction of carbon dioxide to methane. These                 
              studies are original and significant.
