Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The proposed review of coastal meteorology is a timely                    
              opportunity to examine a variety of mesoscale problems, which are              
              often neglected or only acknowledged in incidental ways.                       
              Moreover, some mesoscale circulations and cognate problems                     
              associated with the coastal zone, the Great Lakes, estuaries,                  
              etc. could provide important clues for the dynamical structure                 
              and response of other circulations which are often difficult,                  
              hazardous, or expensive to investigate.
