Abstract    :
                   Two replicate 30-m sediment cores from Owens Lake  California             
              have been recovered.  Paleomagnetic data from older Owens Lake core            
              suggest that a high-resolution paleomagnetic secular variation                 
              (PSV) recorded can be recovered from these cores.  This record                 
              should completely overlap the Mono Lake PSV record which includes              
              the Mono Lake excursion and a distinctive pattern of repeating                 
              waveforms after the excursion.  A PSV record from Owens Lake for               
              late Pleistocene time will be recovered and the validity of the                
              Mono Lake record tested.  Paleointensity studies on both the new               
              Owens Lake cores and our stored samples from  Mono Lake will also              
              be carried out.  The combined study of both lakes will provide an              
              important cross-validation for the paleointensity records.                     
              Finally, the PI will use PSV correlations, radiocarbon dates, and              
              rock magnetic data to asses the timing of paleoclimatic changes                
              recorded in the sediments of Mono and Owens Lakes.  This study will            
              provide an important new higher-resolution view of PSV (both field             
              vector and paleointensity) in western North America and will be                
              linked with other ongoing studies to provide a broader picture of              
              North American PSV for more than the last 30,000 years.
