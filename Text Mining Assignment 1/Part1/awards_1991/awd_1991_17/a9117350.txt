Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The primary objective of this proposal is to clarify the origins of            
              Indo-European populations.  This is a very important topic which is            
              at the interface of paleoanthropological studies using fossil                  
              materials and genetic studies drawing upon gene frequency data.                
              There are currently two competing theories about the origin of                 
              these populations and the spread of agriculture from the Middle                
              East.  One view holds that the people themselves migrated westward,            
              bringing the new technology with them.  The other holds that the               
              technology spread by diffusion without the movement of people.  The            
              computer simulations proposed here will help to decide between                 
              these competing views.
