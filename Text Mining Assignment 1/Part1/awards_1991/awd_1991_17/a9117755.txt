Abstract    :
                   This award provides matching funds for equipment to be used               
              in the principal investigator's high-temperature-pressure                      
              laboratory recently established in the Department of Earth and                 
              Planetary Sciences at Harvard University. Items of equipment                   
              include a high-temperature furnace with provisions for mixed gas               
              atmosphere regulation, a petrographic microscope, and special                  
              tungsten carbide anvils for the lab's multi-anvil, high-pressure               
              apparatus.                                                                     
                   The fully equipped laboratory will be utilized by the                     
              principal investigator, colleagues, and their graduate students in             
              studies of geologically relevant materials under deep earth                    
              conditions in order to elucidate the early planetary                           
              transformations that have produced the modern Earth.
