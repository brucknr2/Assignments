Abstract    :
                   This award provides 53% funding for the acquisition of an                 
              internally-heated pressure vessel capable of maintaining pressures             
              up to 0.1 GPa (10 Kbars) and temperatures up to 1400K                          
              simultaneously. The pressure system is to be installed and operated            
              in the Fluids Research Laboratory in the Department of Geological              
              Sciences at Virginia Institute of Technology and State University.             
                   The equipment will be used primarily in research on the                   
              properties of geologically relevant fluids under the ambient                   
              conditions in the Earth's crust. Present work in the Fluids                    
              Research Laboratory is focussed on water and carbon dioxide fluid              
              mixtures with dissolved chloride salts, their behavior when trapped            
              in fluid inclusions in minerals, and their use in the                          
              reconstruction of geological conditions at the time of fluid                   
              inclusion formation.
