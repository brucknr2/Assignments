Abstract    :
                   The ultimate aim of this work is the understanding of the                 
              rheology of the mantle and the conditions there which are                      
              responsible for plate motion.  The movement of tectonic plates must            
              be accommodated by flow in Earth's mantle.  This flow occurs in the            
              solid state and in turn must be accommodated by the motion of                  
              defects within crystals and along grain boundaries.  As seismic                
              strain waves traverse the mantle they interact with these defects              
              which results in attenuations.  This study is aimed at gaining an              
              understanding of the interaction of seismic waves with defects in              
              single crystals of mantle minerals.  An experimental apparatus has             
              been developed to measure the attenuation of strain waves at                   
              seismic strains and frequencies and under mantle conditions of                 
              temperature and chemical environment.  Olivine has been chosen as              
              the first minerals to be studied because of its proposed abundance             
              in the mantle and because it is quite deformable under mantle                  
              conditions.  The state of stress in Earth's mantle is probably the             
              major factor controlling the defect structure there.  An                       
              understanding of that structure, gained through the comparison of              
              laboratory attenuation measurements with seismic data, should                  
              eventually yield stress mapping of Earth's mantle.
