Abstract    :
                   The American Geological Institute (AGI) provides a variety of             
              informational services to the geoscience research community                    
              including a geological references database (GeoRef),                           
               a bibliography and index of geology, human resources surveys, a               
              directory of geoscience departments, and a glossary of geological              
              terms.  Replacement of an obsolete data processing system will                 
              allow AGI to continue to provide these services and to improve its             
              ability to handle the bibliographic data, human resources surveys,             
              and maintain lists of data sources.  This will involve improving               
              the present network by adding a new server, adding a statistical               
              analysis workstation, and replacing the 18 terminals on the old                
              network with new workstations for the upgraded network.  With this             
              system upgrade AGI can provide information much more specifically              
              tailored to the topical and geographical needs of the research                 
              community.
