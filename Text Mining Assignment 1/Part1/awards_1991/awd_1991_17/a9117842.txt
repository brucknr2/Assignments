Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Description: This project supports travel and                                  
              field expenses for Dr. R. Newton of the                                        
              University of Chicago to collaborate with three                                
              Indian geologists: Dr. A.S Janardhan of Mysor                                  
              University, Dr. T.C. Devaraju of Karnatak                                      
              University, and Dr. B. Mahabaleswar of                                         
              Bangalore University.  The research will                                       
              continue investigations of the late Archean                                    
              deep-crustal section of southern Karnataka and                                 
              northern Tamil Nadu, India, following on the                                   
              earlier NSF-supported project of the Principal                                 
              investigator.  The orthopyroxene isograde                                      
              ("Fermor's Line") will be investigated as to                                   
              causative mineral reactions, areal continuity,                                 
              geochemical progression, and evidence for the                                  
              role of infiltrating fluids in the Archean deep                                
              crust.  The major thrust of the project will be                                
              the elucidation of the early history of a                                      
              continent.  The project also provides funds for                                
              living expenses of the Indian scientists while                                 
              doing laboratory studies in the U.S.                                           
                                                                                             
              Scope: The U.S. scientist is a well respected                                  
              geologist with long experience in Indian                                       
              geological research.  He is particularly                                       
              qualified to accomplish the most through the                                   
              collaboration with the selected Indian                                         
              scientists.  The area of research is of                                        
              interest to the U.S. and is also of great                                      
              interest to the Indian scientists.  The project                                
              fully meets the objectives of the US-India                                     
              Program.
