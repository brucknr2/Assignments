Abstract    :
              Professor Gingerich is supported by a grant from the                           
              Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to study the                   
              thermodynamic stabilities of metal, carbon, and semiconductor                  
              clusters.  Thermodynamic properties of small inorganic clusters                
              will be determined from high temperature equilibrium                           
              measurements with a Knudsen effusion cell mass spectrometer.                   
              Systems studied will include diatomic transition metals,                       
              carbides and nitrides, and clusters of metals, carbon, silicon,                
              germanium and inter-group IV compounds.  Bond energies and                     
              enthalpies of formation will be derived from the measured                      
              reaction enthalpies.  For selected molecules the equilibrium                   
              measurements will be complemented by theoretical calculations                  
              and matrix isolation spectroscopic investigations in order to                  
              elucidate the molecular structure and nature of bonding.                       
              %%%                                                                            
              The proposed investigations will provide much needed                           
              fundamental knowledge for refractory materials of applied                      
              interest.  It is expected that the results obtained from this                  
              research will aid the finding of new materials with improved                   
              technological properties.
