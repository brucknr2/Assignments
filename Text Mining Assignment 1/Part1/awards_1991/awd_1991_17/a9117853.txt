Abstract    :
              This award supports a study of Noegene volcanism in                            
              Antarctica.  The work addresses two issues:  1) the nature                     
              of the underlying tectonic forces shaping west Antarctica,                     
              including the Antarctic Peninsula and the Transantarctic                       
              Mountains, and 2) the nature of subpolar mantle in relation                    
              to global mantle heterogeneities, and the dynamics of mantle                   
              convection.  The investigation focuses on the geochemistry                     
              (major and trace elements; Strontium, Neodymium, Lead                          
              isotopes) of selected basalts from Balleny, Scott and Peter                    
              I Islands, the Hallett and Melbourne Volcanic Provinces, the                   
              Jones Mountains, and Deep Sea Drilling Sites 274, 323 and                      
              690C.  The work will determine the geochemical signatures                      
              for basalts from the various volcanic provinces in order to                    
              ascertain regional relationships and to evaluate hot spot                      
              versus rifting scenarios for these provinces.
