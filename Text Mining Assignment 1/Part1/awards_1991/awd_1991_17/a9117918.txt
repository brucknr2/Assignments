Abstract    :
                   This award provides partial support towards the cost of                   
              technical support in the Institute of Tectonics, Board on Earth                
              Sciences at the University of California, Santa Cruz. The                      
              University is committed to providing the remaining support                     
              required.                                                                      
                   The Institute of Tectonics is engaged in research programs in             
              earthquake and global seismology, including intensive analysis of              
              digital seismic data to refine models of the Earth's deep interior             
              structure and to understand the physics of earthquake faulting and             
              the propagation of seismic waves. The Institute's extensive                    
              computer systems and applications require the services of a systems            
              manager. This award, combined with the institution's contribution,             
              will provide for the services of a manager for the next three                  
              years.
