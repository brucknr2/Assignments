Abstract    :
              Surface growth is a key feature of bacterial action in nature.  The            
              E. coli colony is an excellent model system of bacterial surface               
              populations.  It is a highly organized structure characterized by              
              differential gene expression.  Cell-cell interactions over                     
              distances of microns regulate the growth of individuals cells, and             
              gene expression patterns can be coordinated between populations                
              separated by distances of millimeters.  Diffusible signals affect              
              several aspects of colony development. Genetic loci subject                    
              differential control during colony development have been identified            
              by spontaneous and transposon insertion mutations and the use of               
              lacZ fusions.  In addition, the cAMP system has been implicated in             
              activating the spatially localized replication of Mudiac elements.             
              The experimental program will extend these initial observations by             
              detailed study of three systems:(1) developmental regulation of the            
              dev1891::lacZ fusion.  (2) the role of DNA polymerase 1, the cAMP              
              system, and diffusible substances in the control of Mudiac                     
              replication, and (3) the dev2137 and dev2137 mutations located in              
              the oriC region of the chromosome.  The results will specify gene              
              products involved in colony morphogenesis, provide a more detailed             
              picture of differential gene expression during growth on an agar               
              surface, and identify diffusible signals that affect colony                    
              developments.
