Abstract    :
                   The biology of one of the oldest and most successful                      
              predators, sharks, has often intrigued scientists and amateurs.                
              Sharks and their relatives, the skates and rays, originated from               
              bony fish ancestors some 400 million years ago.  Today they are                
              the dominant predators of the oceans.  Despite great interest in               
              their feeding behaviors, there exists scant scientific knowledge               
              of their feeding mechanisms.  The anatomy of the heads and jaws                
              of arguably the most successful group, the requiem or                          
              carcharhiniform sharks (tiger, lemon, hammerhead sharks), has                  
              been little studied.                                                           
                   Dr. Philip Motta of the University of South Florida, with                 
              assistance from colleagues at the Mote Marine Laboratory and the               
              Florida Institute of Technology, is studying the feeding                       
              mechanics and cranial anatomy of two groups of sharks with                     
              contrasting modes of feeding.  These are biting and gouging lemon              
              sharks, and suction and crushing nurse sharks.  Descriptive study              
              of jaw musculature and cranial nerves will be supplemented with                
              high-speed photography of feeding behaviors and electromyography,              
              to measure electrical signals controlling feeding movements.                   
              Detailed examination of the functional morphology of sharks will               
              help in understanding the evolution of contrasting feeding styles              
              in these marine predators, and in general will improve                         
              understanding of the origins of feeding behaviors in early                     
              vertebrate groups.
