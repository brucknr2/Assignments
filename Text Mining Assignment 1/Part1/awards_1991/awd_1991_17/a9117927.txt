Abstract    :
              The principal investigator will study cation diffusion at elevated             
              pressure and temperature in the minerals garnet and orthopyroxene.             
              Results of the work will be applied to the interpretation of                   
              metamorphic rock history, as well as the history of certain rocks              
              in the Earth's mantle.
