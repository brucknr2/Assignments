Abstract    :
                   The PI will continue to develop new methods to analyze the                
              statistical structure of the magnetic field reversal chronology,               
              in particular, to relax the constraint applied to all previous                 
              statistical analyses of reversal chronologies that reversals occur             
              instantaneously.  One of the main reasons for doing this is to                 
              examine the core's stability properties in the time intervals that             
              include polarity transitions.  A secondary goal of these models is             
              to help identify the most unreliable sections of the magnetic                  
              reversal chronology.  An additional goal is to examine polarity                
              transition data and mean field data to determine if there are                  
              statistically significant departures of the Earth's magnetic field             
              from axial symmetry.  Emphasis will be placed on combining all the             
              above data analyses with dynamo (and related) theory.
