Abstract    :
              The enzyme carbonic anhydrase catalyzes the interconversion of                 
              the two forms of inorganic carbon, CO2 and HCO3, which                         
              predominate in aqueous media at physiological pH values.  In                   
              the alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, one or more forms of                       
              carbonic anhydrase are components of a system for inorganic                    
              carbon acquisition and concentration. This system enables these                
              organisms to efficiently utilize CO2 present at low levels,                    
              which could otherwise limit their growth.  A carbonic                          
              anhydrase-specific active site-directed radiolabeled                           
              photoaffinity reagent will be synthesized in order to study the                
              physical relationship between the large and small subunits with                
              respect to the active site of the enzyme, and as a tool in the                 
              identification and isolation of physiologically important                      
              intracellular  forms of carbonic anhydrase which are present in                
              levels too low to be readily identified and quantified  by                     
              currently available methods.  This proposal will investigate                   
              the relationship between the subunit structure and disulfide                   
              bond reduction status on both the catalytic and inhibitor                      
              binding properties of the predominant extracellular form of                    
              carbonic anhydrase from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.  These                      
              studies will contribute to understanding the structure-function                
              relationship of the extracellular carbonic anhydrase, and to                   
              the identification of other important components of the system                 
              by which Chlamydomonas reinhardtii cells are able to                           
              efficiently concentrate inorganic carbon to provide CO2 for                    
              photosynthesis.
