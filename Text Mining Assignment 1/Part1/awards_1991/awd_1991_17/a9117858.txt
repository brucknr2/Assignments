Abstract    :
              The principal investigators will study the high-pressure chemistry             
              of materials that comprise the Earth's mantle and core. Studies of             
              phase equilibria, thermodynamic properties, and structure will be              
              carried out at high pressure and temperature using the diamond                 
              anvil cell and a variety of spectroscopic techniques. The work is              
              crucial to an understanding of the Earth's deep interior.
