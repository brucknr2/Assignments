Abstract    :
                   The tectonic history of New England includes several paleozoic            
              orogenies that involved collision and accretion of island arc                  
              fragments and continental blocks.  Because of this tectonic                    
              complexity, stratigraphic and structural correlations are difficult            
              and despite extensive study, several key relationships are                     
              equivocal.  Recent work has shown that a volcanic unit thought to              
              be a remnant of an island arc that collided with North America                 
              during the Taconic contains rocks of two distinctly different ages             
              - Silurian and Cambrian.  This RUI project will restudy this unit              
              by mapping and radiometric age dating in order to resolve the                  
              stratigraphic position of the fragment or fragments.  Results will             
              help to better constrain tectonic models of western New England.
