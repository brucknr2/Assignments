Abstract    :
              Studies of proteins involved in photosynthesis point to an                     
              important pathway of fermentation which permits survival of                    
              cyanobacteria and algae under dark, anaerobic conditions.  Studies             
              of the soluble, low potential cytochrome c which is abundant in                
              some cyanobacteria and algae suggest that this cytochrome links                
              ferredoxin to hydrogenase in supporting the fermentation of                    
              carbohydrate reserves.  The hypothesis of cytochrome function to               
              be tested is based on data from enzymology and cell physiology.                
              It must be confirmed by the techniques of gene deletion.  Studies              
              of the chemistry of catalyst interaction and of regulation of                  
              expression of the genes involved are proposed.  Different sets of              
              catalysts of this pathway were present in different compartments               
              of the cell.  The structure and function of these proteins will be             
              studied.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              There is evidence that a carotenoid protein may function to protect            
              cyanobacteria from photodestruction in bright light.  Experiments              
              are proposed to extend and clarify this hypothesis.                            
                                                                                             
              Cytochrome c6 may be a catalyst of both photosynthetic and                     
              respiratory electron transport.  We have found three isoforms of               
              this catalyst.  The PI will study the chemical basis for these                 
              forms and look for roles in distinct catalytic functions or in                 
              targeting to different compartments of the cell.
