Abstract    :
              This project is to continue work on volcanic gas emissions to the              
              atmosphere.  It will involve field sampling at volcanoes using a               
              variety of techniques, thermochemical modelling of speciation and              
              reactions, and development and use of remote sensing methods.  In              
              the next two years, the plan is to focus on the testing of a new               
              field laser Raman spectrometer which has the potential of providing            
              a new capability for remotely sensing many gas species.  The                   
              results are of potential interest to atmospheric scientists who                
              want data on volcano/atmosphere interchanges, volcanologists                   
              interested in forecasting volcanic events or in volcanic gas                   
              hazards, and geochemists interested in metal volatilities and ore              
              deposits of fluid/rock interactions at high temperatures.
