Abstract    :
              The goal of this multidisciplinary project is to design and                    
              prototype a new approach in database environments to support                   
              collaborative scientific research.  The prototype integrates                   
              scientific data visualization and mathematical and statistical                 
              analysis tools with database support in a highly interactive                   
              environment.  A new model for scientific data is founded on the                
              notion that a query of a scientific data base conceptually creates             
              new derived data whose relationship to the parent database is                  
              defined by the query.  Each query, in principle, leads to the                  
              discovery of additional structure in the data that is either                   
              explicit in the results of the query, or hypothesized by the                   
              scientist(s) from results of queries.  The system uses a process               
              flow graph to represent queries.  The project, carried out by a                
              team of two computer scientists, an applied mathematician, and                 
              scientists from earth science, civil engineering and atmospheric               
              science, contributes to ongoing research in the fields of                      
              environmental biology and chemistry, oil reservoir analysis, and               
              polar ice core study.  This work will produce a new data model for             
              scientific data and will design and prototype an integrated data               
              management, analysis and visualization environment to support                  
              interdisciplinary scientific investigation.
