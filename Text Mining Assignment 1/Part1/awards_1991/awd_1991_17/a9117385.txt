Abstract    :
              There is now convincing evidence on many levels that metabolic                 
              pathways within the mitochondrion are organized.  These pathways               
              include the Krebs TCA cycle, fatty acid oxidation, amino acid                  
              metabolism, and the Krebs urea cycle.  Three areas concerning                  
              molecular organization which are still to be elucidated concern the            
              chemical nature of the specific protein-protein interactions, the              
              metabolic consequences of disrupted metabolons, and the relation               
              of the supramolecular complexes to the overall morphology of the               
              mitochondrion.  The specific aims of this research are to: a)                  
              determine the binding sites on citrate synthase that interact with             
              its membrane binding protein (citrate transporter?) and with its               
              reaction partners, malate dehydrogenase, pyruvate dehydrogenase                
              complex, thiolase, and aconitase; b) analyze the growth and                    
              metabolic pattern of yeast cells containing peroxisomal citrate                
              synthase in their mitochondria; and c) determine whether cristal               
              morphology of yeast mitochondria can be changed by the introduction            
              of a characteristic membrane protein from adrenal mitochondrial                
              inner membranes.
