Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will support a two-year U.S.-Japan cooperative science              
              project between Professor Toshi Tajima, Department of Physics,                 
              University of Texas, Austin, and Professor Atsushi Ogata, National             
              Laboratory for High Energy Physics (KEK), Tsukuba, Japan.  The                 
              purpose of the project is to investigate and explore novel methods             
              of particle acceleration via intense lasers experimentally and                 
              theoretically for future accelerators.  Among the projects to be               
              explored are the laser wakefield acceleration, ionization front wake,          
              and plasma resonant cavity.  The salability to higher energies will            
              be investigated experimentally and theoretically.                              
                                                                                             
              The expertise of the U.S. and Japanese groups are complementary.               
              The U.S. investigators will travel to Tsukuba to coordinate and                
              fine-tune their work on computational, theoretical, and laser                  
              development with the experimental results obtained by the Japanese             
              group.  The U.S. group has developed a theoretical and                         
              computational model of wakefield excitation by intense short laser             
              pulses, while the Japanese group has carried out wakefield                     
              excitation experiments by a charged particle beam and assembled a              
              team of experimentalists for a laser wakefield excitation.
