Abstract    :
              Fouling occurs in most heat exchangers and the associated                      
              degradation of performance is of considerable economical                       
              importance.  It has plagued industry for years and remains                     
              poorly understood and resolved.  The proposal is a                             
              continuation of current NSF funded research, during which                      
              interesting results have been obtained.  The proposed research                 
              will include fundamental studies on solubility and                             
              polymerization, effect of salt ions on attachments of silica                   
              scale, transient measurement of fouling thermal resistance,                    
              and analytical modelling of solubility and silica scale                        
              formation.  Applied topics to be investigated will include                     
              mitigation of fouling by magnetic devices and ozonation.
