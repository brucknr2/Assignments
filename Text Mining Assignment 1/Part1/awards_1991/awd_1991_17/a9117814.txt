Abstract    :
              The goal of the proposed project is to understand the metabolic                
              controls on proline and putrescine synthesis in two plants (pea,               
              oat) that exhibit fundamentally different responses to osmotic                 
              stress.  Oat leaves accumulate putrescine to high levels, while                
              proline accumulation is minimal.  Pea leaves accumulate proline,               
              but very little putrescine.  Radiolabeled precursors and inhibitors            
              of the arginine, putrescine and proline biosynthetic pathways will             
              be used to investigate basic metabolic responses to stress in these            
              plants.  Cellular and molecular mechanisms regulating the                      
              activities of the arginine decarboxylase (ADC), which catalyzes the            
              first reaction in the putrescine biosynthetic pathway, and                     
              pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase (P5CR), an enzyme which carries              
              out the final step in proline biosynthesis will be investigated.               
              There is evidence that the activities of both ADC and P5CR are                 
              stress-inducible and these enzymes may play important roles in the             
              regulation of proline and putrescine accumulation in response to               
              stress.  A more complete understanding of stress-dependent changes             
              in these pathways may yield new insights into basic underlying                 
              stress adaptation strategies used by plants and may lead to the                
              development of cultivars with improved stress tolerance                        
              characteristics.
