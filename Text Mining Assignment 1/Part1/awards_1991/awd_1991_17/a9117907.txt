Abstract    :
              Permanently ice-covered Lake Bonney, an Antarctic lake with two                
              distinct lobes, presents a special situation where turbulence and              
              upper trophic levels are virtually non-existent.  This unusual                 
              environment yields a system where microbially-mediated processes               
              dominate biogeochemical reactions.  Current information on                     
              nitrogen dynamics in Lake Bonney indicates that phytoplankton are              
              nitrogen-deficient, that nitrous oxide concentration in the                    
              chemocline of the east lobe is the highest recorded in nature,                 
              that bulk denitrification does not exist in the east lobe and                  
              that nitrogen values in the west lobe are the highest ever                     
              measured in an aquatic system. It is hypothesized that 1) both                 
              ammonia and oxidized nitrogen are significant regenerated                      
              nutrients in the upper trophogenic zone, 2) nitrous oxide is a                 
              product of nitrification and 3) bulk denitrification acts as a                 
              sink for nitrous oxide in the west lobe, regulating its                        
              accumulation.  These hypotheses will be addressed by measuring                 
              microbial regeneration and utilization of ammonia, nitrite and                 
              nitrate, nitrous oxide production, and the distribution of                     
              nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria.  This study will be one of               
              the first to examine nitrogen dynamics in a system lacking "top-               
              down" regulation and will provide important clues regarding                    
              microbial nitrous oxide production.  This project is jointly                   
              supported by the National Science Foundation and the National                  
              Aeronautics and Space Administration.
