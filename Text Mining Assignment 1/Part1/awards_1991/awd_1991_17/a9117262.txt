Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project is collaborative with SES 9109809 (Lawler).                       
                                                                                             
              This project continues and extends a theory of bargaining and                  
              deterrence studied under previous NSF grants.  The theory tested               
              here integrates theories of bilateral deterrence with those of                 
              unilateral positive initiatives.  The most important new idea                  
              under test is that power relations between parties - in par-                   
              ticular, high ability of both parties to punish each other -                   
              condition the success of conciliatory initiatives.  The extended               
              theory is tested in a series of laboratory experiments in which                
              parties bargain, exchanging offers and counteroffers, while also               
              having the capability to levy punitive damage on each other.                   
              Results identify abstract, general conditions under which con-                 
              flicting parties can produce conciliation without intervention of              
              mediators or arbitrators.
