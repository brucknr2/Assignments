Abstract    :
                   Comprehensive petrological studies of regionally metamorphosed            
              rocks from the Grenville orogen will provide detailed P-T-t paths              
              for the different tectonic units in the orogen.  New petrological              
              techniques for the analysis of single-grain, zoned, refractory                 
              phases will be refined and calibrated during this study.  The                  
              results will aid the tectonic reconstruction of the middle crustal             
              section of the Grenville orogen, and will have wide applicability              
              to metamorphic terranes in other orogenic belts.
