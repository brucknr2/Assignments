Abstract    :
                   This grant is being made to cover round trip air fare to                  
              Moscow, USSR for six American Scientists for attending an                      
              international workshop on cloud chemistry organized by the World               
              Meteorological Organization (WMO).  Dr. Rumen Bojkov, Chief,                   
              Environment Division of WMO is convening the workshop with the                 
              help of Dr. Peter Summers.  The workshop is co-chaired by V.                   
              Mohnen and Professor Chernikov.  All expenses in Moscow will be                
              paid for from funds secured by Prof. Chernikov.  The workshop                  
              will be held from September 30 - October 4, 1991.  As a result of              
              these cloud induced processes, the tropospheric oxidation                      
              efficiency and trace gas budgets for many sulfur nitrogen and                  
              carbon containing species ar significantly altered.  The workshop              
              will first review the current status of knowledge of cloud                     
              chemistry in order to assess the role clouds play i global                     
              chemical cycling in the atmosphere, in the study of global change              
              and related concerns and finally to identify future research                   
              needs in support of these programs.  A document will be prepared               
              and published detailing the results of our assessment and                      
              outlining future research needs.
