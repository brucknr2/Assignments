Abstract    :
              The stable isotope geochemistry of fossil foraminifera has become              
              an indispensable tool for reconstructing paleoceanographic and                 
              paleoclimatic fluctuations in the earth's past.  Specifically,                 
              isotopic data have been used to establish glacial-interglacial                 
              cycles, infer the size of continental ice-sheets and to estimate               
              paleoceanic temperature fluctuations.  Despite the success in                  
              applying these data to paleoclimatic problems, a large portion of              
              the potential data available for analysis remains unused.  In this             
              proposal, a strategy is outlined to access this unused information             
              to extract new paleoclimatic and paleoceanographic information from            
              the marine fossil record.  Using the intraspecific stable isotopic             
              variability found within populations of fossil foraminiferal shells            
              which have been individually analyzed, it is now possible to obtain            
              absolute seasonal sea surface temperatures (SST) for paleoceans.               
              In addition, a procedure is proposed to determine the oxygen                   
              isotopic composition of seawater ( 18Ow) during the last glacial               
              cycle and penultimate deglaciation.   18Ow is a critical parameter             
              used to model the growth of continental ice sheets.  Absolute                  
              determinations of SST and  18Ow during key intervals over the last             
              150,000 years will provide a suite of new paleoclimatic information            
              for global change models of the last glacial cycle.
