Abstract    :
                   This award will provide two-thirds funding for the development            
              of a stimulated Brillouin scattering instrumentation system that               
              will use dynamic shock compression techniques to measure                       
              compressional and shear wave seismic velocities in minerals of the             
              Earth's mantle under mantle conditions of temperature (up to 3500K)            
              and pressure (up to 130 GPa). The instrument system is to be                   
              developed in the shock pressure laboratory in the Division of                  
              Geological and Planetary Sciences at the California Institute of               
              Technology. Caltech is committed to providing the remaining one-               
              third funding necessary to carry out the project.                              
                   There is a strong need for direct laboratory measurements of              
              seismic velocities in the materials considered to exist in the                 
              Earth's deep mantle. Such measurements are required for the                    
              geological interpretation of seismic velocity-depth profiles                   
              reconstructed from earthquake and other seismic signals. Current               
              high-pressure technology does not permit such measurements under               
              conditions of static pressure, and shockwave techniques to be                  
              developed in this project offer the only means of obtaining them.
