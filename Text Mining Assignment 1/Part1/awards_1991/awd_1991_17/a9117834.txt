Abstract    :
                This grant provides support to analyze data gathered from other              
              funding in a region of the San Andreas fault at San Francisco                  
              bay.  The data was recorded from a USGS active marine seismic                  
              profile across the ocean-land transition and up the East Bay.                  
              The goal is to use fan-geometry deployments to provide structural              
              information constraining the depth of penetration of the                       
              individual strike-slip faults in the area.  In-line geometry                   
              recordings will be used to measure velocities across the faults                
              to constrain the maximum depth to which velocity differences                   
              occur across the individual strike-slip faults.  This research is              
              a component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
