Abstract    :
                   This is a combined experimental, theoretical, and field                   
              investigation of the physics of fracture systems, particularly                 
              applied to geological systems.  In the experimental program the PI             
              will investigate the development of fracture systems in brittle                
              films on ductile substrates.  This will be accomplished by the                 
              analysis of video images made during the experiments.  The                     
              evolution of the statistics will be measured, as well as the                   
              specific terms in the network growth equations: crack propagation              
              rates, coelescence, and crack-crack interactions.  The field work              
              will involve detailed mapping, with still video techniques, of                 
              several natural exposures of systems of normal faults in the cm to             
              10m scale range, for comparison with the experimental results and              
              with other natural examples.
