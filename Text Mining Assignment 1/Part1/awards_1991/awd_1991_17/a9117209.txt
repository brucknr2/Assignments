Abstract    :
                   This proposal is for a planning grant for investigating the               
              possibilities of joining the established Industry/University                   
              Cooperative Research Center for Software Engineering at Purdue                 
              University and the University of Florida.  The PI at Arizona State             
              University will use the funds to be provided by this award to                  
              recruit industrial members for the proposed Center, to develop a               
              menu of research projects that will enhance the present joint                  
              I/UCRC at Purdue  and Florida University and to develop the                    
              administrative protocols that will be necessary to have a viable               
              Center.  Arizona State University already has several contracts in             
              the  industries located in Arizona and feel that these industries              
              will support the creation of a joint Center with the University of             
              Florida and Purdue University.                                                 
                   The Program Director recommends an award for $25,000 for a                
              planning grant to establish a joint Center with the existing I/UCRC            
              at the University of Florida and Purdue University
