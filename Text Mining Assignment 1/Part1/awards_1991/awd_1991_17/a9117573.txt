Abstract    :
                This research is aimed at the ongoing debate over whether or                 
              not slabs at subduction zones penetrate into the lower mantle                  
              below about 670 km depth.  The technique will be to measure                    
              travel times from WWSSN and Canadian network seismograms and                   
              model them using a fully 3-D finite difference algorithm.  The                 
              area to be studied will be the Kurile and Japan subduction zones.              
              Use of only relative times of arrival at the same stations will                
              reduce the influence of choice of a reference earth model,                     
              station delays, and long-wavelength lower mantle anomalies.  The               
              question of slab penetration below 670 km is key to formulating                
              convection models of the earth's mantle.
