Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award supports a two-year U.S.-Japan cooperative research                 
              project between Professors John Wefel and Michael Cherry,                      
              Department of Physics and Astronomy, Louisiana State University,               
              and Professor Takeshi Ogata, Institute for Cosmic Ray Research,                
              University of Tokyo.  It is part of the Japanese-American                      
              Cooperative Emulsion Experiment (JACEE), which began in 1978                   
              to investigate the physics of high energy nucleus-nucleus                      
              interactions at energies above those available at accelerators and for         
              studying the nuclear composion of primary cosmic rays extending                
              up to the extensive air shower (EAS) region.  The JACEE                        
              Collaboration involves four institutions in the United States and              
              eight in Japan.                                                                
                                                                                             
              Japan produces the world's highest quality nuclear emulsion and                
              Japanese researchers pioneered the use of emulsion chambers.                   
              Scientists in the United States have developed the technology for              
              high altitude balloon flights, including the newest Long Duration              
              Ballooning (LDB) capability.  Laboratories in both countries are               
              well equipped to carry out detailed microscope measurements                    
              involved in analyzing particle events in emulsion chambers.  This              
              grant will permit the U.S. investigators to travel to collaborating            
              institutions in Japan.  Contributing to this grant is the NSF                  
              Division of Physics, which will support shipping costs and the costs           
              of travel of the investigators to the site of balloon flights in               
              Australia.
