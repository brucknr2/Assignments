Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Multicomponent seismic reflection, magnetotelluric,                       
              structural, and petrological studies of Basin-and-Range crust will             
              be performed to study problems of fluids in the crust including                
              magma at the Moho, crustal inflow beneath uplifted core complexes,             
              underplating, mid-crustal detachment zones, anisotropy, and nature             
              of lower crust.  Structural plunge of the Ruby Mountains core                  
              complex,  producing greater than 10 km difference in level of                  
              exposure, offers a particularly good setting to study these                    
              problems.  The combination of S-waves as well as P-waves together              
              with conductivity in the deep crust provides a good opportunity to             
              constrain various possibilities suggested for Basin-and-Range                  
              crust, especially because seismic and MT results complement each               
              other in explaining conductive zones.  Data acquisition involving              
              about 1550 seismic channels is designed to optimize S-wave data for            
              maximum resolution, and the question of resolution in seismic and              
              MT interpretation is a major consideration in developing                       
              conclusions.  Models obtained from geophysical interpretation will             
              be integrated with petrology and structure.
