Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal uses time of flight atom-probe field ion microscopy              
              (APFIM) to examine the near-surface composition profiles associated            
              with surface segregation in metal alloys.  Composition variations              
              in the near surface layers of platinum-rhodium, platinum-gold,                 
              platinum-nickel, and molybdenum-rhenium alloys are measured over a             
              depth of 10 to 15 atomic layers.  The specimens are in the form of             
              emitter tips with thin films deposited on the tip surface and                  
              interfaces parallel to the tip emitter surface.  The pattern of                
              chemical distribution is determined as a function of depth below               
              the surface and correlated with alloy behavior such as                         
              chemisorption and order-disorder phase transformations.                        
              %%%                                                                            
              It is important to understand the elemental segregation at the                 
              surface of metal alloys because surface composition can affect                 
              potential applications that require properties such as oxidation               
              resistance, chemisorption, catalytic behavior, and wear resistance.
