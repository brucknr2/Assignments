Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will use gravity and bathymetry data from a large                 
              number of detailed surveys of ridge axes with spreading rates that             
              vary by an order of magnitude to examine the spreading rate                    
              dependence of mantle bouguer anomalies at mid-ocean ridges crests.             
              The spreading rate dependence of the along-axis segmentation of the            
              ridge axis will be examined and the transition between patterns                
              observed at slow-spreading ridges and fast-spreading ridges will be            
              determined.  The spreading rate dependence of isostasy and the                 
              support of ridge axis topography will also be examined.
