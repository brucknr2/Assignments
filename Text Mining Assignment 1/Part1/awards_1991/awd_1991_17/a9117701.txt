Abstract    :
                   This a comprehensive study of shale meso- and microfabrics on             
              a suite of shale units from a variety of climates and basin types.             
              All shale units contain a wide range of sedimentary environments               
              from terrestrial to basinal.  The units under study were selected              
              on the basis of good stratigraphic control and prior                           
              sedimentological studies.  Shale fabrics represent the cumulative              
              record of the history of transport, deposition, and burial of these            
              fine-grained rocks.                                                            
                   There is presently a severe deficiency of comprehensive                   
              petrographic and sedimentological case studies of shale units, and             
              the environmental significance of shale fabric features is still               
              poorly understood.  Comparing the full range of meso- and                      
              microfabric features from equivalent sedimentary environments in               
              a suite of well studied shale units will allow us to identify                  
              environmentally significant features (or combinations thereof), and            
              to filter out local factors (due to climate, biological control,               
              basin type etc.).                                                              
                   Data from this study will benefit efforts of fabric                       
              classification, will establish correlations between mesofabric and             
              microfabric features, will probably lead to the recognition of                 
              environmentally specific fabric associations and relate fabric                 
              features to basic processes, and will ultimately lead to                       
              considerable refinements in basin analysis studies.
