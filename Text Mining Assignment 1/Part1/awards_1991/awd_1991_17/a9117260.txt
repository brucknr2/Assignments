Abstract    :
                   We propose to investigate the  massive dolomitization of an               
              Upper Miocene reef complex cropping out in excellent three-                    
              dimensional exposures near Nijar, southeastern Spain.  This                    
              proposal is a renewal for an ongoing project focussing on regional             
              dolomitization of Upper Miocene reefs in Spain, previous work                  
              having studied reefs in Mallorca (Balearic Islands).  Work in                  
              Mallorca has narrowly constrained age of dolomitization, and field,            
              petrographic, geochemical modelling approaches have yielded a model            
              which invokes dolomitization of Messinian reefs by evaporitic                  
              basinal brines that formed as a result of the late Messinian                   
              "salinity crisis".  A  prime objective of the Nijar project is to              
              test the regional applicability of this model, by mapping dolomite             
              and dolomite type distributions within the context of the sequence             
              stratigraphy, and by applying petrographic, geochemical (C, O, Sr              
              isotopes; Ca, Mg, Na, Cl, SO4, Sr, Fe, Mn, Al, K abundances), and              
              quantitative modelling approaches.  Preliminary field and                      
              petrographic work at Nijar has shown similarities in sequence                  
              stratigraphy and dolomite fabrics to those in Las Negras (about                
              20kms away), and in Mallorca.  The Nijar project will also test                
              other dolomitization models involving meteoric and normal seawater.
