Abstract    :
                   This research program is a combined experimental/theoretical              
              effort to investigate the physics of electron correlation in                   
              simple, many-particle systems.  Using photons from synchroton                  
              light source and heavily charged particle collisions, the                      
              investigators probe the dynamics of double ionization and                      
              ionization-excitation in the simplest of all a three-body                      
              systems, the helium atom.
