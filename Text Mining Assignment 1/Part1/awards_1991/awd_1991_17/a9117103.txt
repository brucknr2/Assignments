Abstract    :
              The proposed research will investigate the origin of igneous rocks             
              in the Klamath Mountain province that are the remnants of two                  
              extensive arc systems.  Although the systems, the western                      
              Hayfork/Ironside Mountain complex and the Rogue/Chetco complex,                
              represent the most voluminous accretionary arcs in the province,               
              they have received little detailed petrologic study.  Their origin             
              will be investigated with the use of detailed mapping and sampling,            
              U-Pb (zircon) geochronology, mineral analysis, bulk-rock elemental             
              analysis, and isotopic analysis of bulk samples and mineral                    
              separates.  These data will be used to estimate the composition of             
              the source rocks, to model the effects of fractional                           
              crystallization and crustal contamination, and to provide a means              
              of comparing the arc-related rocks with adjacent, well-studied,                
              remnant arc and back-arc magmatic systems.  The results will be                
              interpreted in the context of local and regional tectonic activity             
              and metamorphism, and will be used to compare Mesozoic arc                     
              magmatism in the Klamath Mountain province with that elsewhere in              
              the North American Cordillera.
