Abstract    :
                   Understanding the thermal and fluid flow consequences of                  
              thrust faulting is necessary to understanding heat and mass                    
              transfer processes in the earth's crust.  Many thrust faults                   
              preserve an inverted metamorphic gradient in their footwall rocks,             
              but the mechanisms to produce this are poorly understood.  This                
              study will constrain the mechanisms of metamorphism and fluid flow             
              associated with prograde inverted metamorphic gradients in                     
              supracrustal rocks of the footwall in two ranges in western                    
              Arizona.  It will also test the hypothesis that fluids released                
              during the prograde metamorphism migrated upwards and caused                   
              retrograde metamorphism in the crystalline rocks of the hanging                
              wall.  The approach will be an integrated study of structures,                 
              petrology, stable isotopes, fluid inclusions and 40Ar/39Ar                     
              systematics.  The results will constrain the mechanisms that                   
              produce inverted metamorphic gradients, and will increase the                  
              understanding of heat and mass transfer processes associated with              
              tectonic events.
