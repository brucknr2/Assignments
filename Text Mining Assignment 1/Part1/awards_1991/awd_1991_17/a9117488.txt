Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Recent results from Dr. Harrington's and other laboratories have               
              suggested that two distinct types of DNA curvature may be important            
              in specific DNA-protein interactions:  sequence directed fixed or              
              intrinsic axial curvature which determines an overall space writhe;            
              and anisotropic axial flexibility associated with specific sequence            
              elements.  Dr. Harrington proposes a line of investigations                    
              designed to clarify these ideas in terms of specific DNA                       
              conformations and structures.  These studies will include: (1)                 
              systematic studies of putative sites of high anisotropic                       
              flexibility using osmium tetroxide adducts and other chemical                  
              probes sensitive to open or distorted DNA structures: (2)                      
              development of appropriate scanning probe microscopy technologies              
              to visualize these structural features directly; (3) use of other              
              biophysical techniques such as polyacrylamide gel retardation, ring            
              closure (cyclization), fluorescence energy transfer and                        
              electrooptical methods to characterize and quantitate DNA                      
              curvature; and (4) systematic searches of DNA sequence databases to            
              uncover the biological roles of curving or bending DNA.
