Abstract    :
                   This award provides for one-third of the funding needed for               
              the acquisition of equipment to monitor seismic, deformational, and            
              explosive activity at Merapi volcano in Indonesia. The additional              
              funding for this acquisition has been committed by the Pennsylvania            
              State University.                                                              
                   Monitoring with this equipment will make it possible to                   
              systematically evaluate the deformation at Merapi volcano over the             
              next few years, a period within which a significant explosive                  
              eruption is considered likely. The equipment requested includes                
              electronic tiltmeters and accompanying telemetry systems to monitor            
              dome activity and a "total station" surveying system to enable                 
              dedicated, full-time monitoring of the Merapi edifice deformation.             
              Deformational data will be interpreted in conjunction with                     
              conventional telemetered seismic data obtained by the                          
              Volcanological Survey of Indonesia as well as a real-time seismic              
              amplitude monitoring system to be installed by the Principal                   
              Investigator. The research to be carried out with this                         
              instrumentation will enable Merapi volcano to be used as a natural             
              laboratory to understand crucial volcano deformational processes,              
              and to test and refine deformation models before and during                    
              volcanic eruption.
