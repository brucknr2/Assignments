Abstract    :
                   This award provides 50% funding for the acquisition of                    
              equipment for the Paleomagnetism Laboratory of the University of               
              California at Davis. Equipment items include an alternating field              
              gradient magnetometer, a Mossbauer spectrometer, a Curie balance               
              system, a magnetic susceptibility bridge, and ancillary equipment.             
                   The laboratory supports the research of the PI, his students,             
              and on-campus as well as off-campus collaborators. The PI's                    
              research program is concentrated in the behavior of the geomagnetic            
              field throughout geologic time, applications of paleomagnetic                  
              techniques to plate tectonics and related geologic phenomena, the              
              origin of rock and mineral magnetism, and environmental magnetism.
