Abstract    :
                   The Cretaceous/Tertiary boundary is marked by a particularly              
              extensive change in the fossil record.  A  consequence of this                 
              major biotic perturbation would be a change in the composition and             
              the amount of organic matter contributed to depositing sediments.              
              The project will investigate the nature of the organic matter                  
              contents of sediments deposited during late Maastrichtian times,               
              at the K/T boundary itself, and during early Danian times.                     
              Analyses will include elemental, isotopic, and molecular                       
              identifiers of the sources and of the preservation of organic                  
              matter components.  Two K/T sections, Brazos (Texas) and Raton                 
              Basin (New Mexico), have been studied by many investigators.                   
              Microfossil, palynological, and other stratigraphic information                
              exist from both locations, which will be helpful in interpreting               
              the geochemical data in terms of paleoenvironmental changes.                   
              Closely spaced samples from several sites at these locations will              
              be the subject of this project.  The investigation will extend to              
              "background" sediments deposited well before and well after the                
              actual K/T boundary in order to determine the extent of natural                
              variability.  Furthermore, geochemical information has suggested               
              a relationship between iridium anomalies at the boundary and                   
              microbial activity, which can be tested by searching for biomarker             
              molecules indicative of microbial residues in the organic matter               
              record.
