Abstract    :
              The principal investigator will conduct melting experiments at high            
              pressures and temperatures on ultrabasic rock compositions                     
              utilizing the multianvil high-pressure laboratory at SUNY/Stony                
              Brook. The main aim of this work is to understand the nature of                
              melting and the evolution of magmas in the Earth's mantle.
