Abstract    :
              This project is an atmospheric modelling effort whose purpose is               
              the examination of the concurrent evolution of the circumpolar                 
              vortex and the antarctic katabatic wind regime.  Katabatic winds               
              occur regularly in the lowest levels of the antarctic atmosphere               
              and form an equatorward-directed branch of the mean circulation in             
              high southern latitudes.  They transport energy and momentum                   
              northward, thereby alleviating some of the intense baroclinicity               
              that develops along the periphery of the antarctic continent                   
              because of the horizontal temperature contrast.  Boundary layer                
              flows appear to have a significant effect in forcing large-scale               
              motions in the middle and upper troposphere over Antarctica.  The              
              fundamental goal of this research is to assess how shallow drainage            
              features affect the heat and momentum budgets of the Antarctic                 
              atmosphere by integrating mesoscale modelling with statistical                 
              analyses of conventional and automatic weather station surface                 
              observations.  The study will complement current studies of the                
              general circulation in high southern latitudes, and of the                     
              antarctic stratospheric vortex.
