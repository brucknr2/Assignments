Abstract    :
                      9117084  Soloway, E.        This is the third year funding of a
              three-year continuing award.   The "human-computer interface" is paramount if
              scientists are to  take full advantage of the vast quantities and types of data
              now  becoming available.  Attention needs to be focused on more than the  query
              language; rather, the interface needs to integrate scientific  databases into
              the everyday work practices of scientists, e.g.,  data exploring, hypothesis
              generating and testing, report and chart  making.  The Task/Artifact
              Methodology is being employed; it  consists of cycles of cognitive task
              analysis, system building, and  testing in ecologically valid contexts, e.g.,
              practicing scientists  using the system on a daily basis.  The resultant
              computer-based  environment, ReV (Representations for Visualization) is user-
              and  task-centered, as opposed to being technology-driven.  ReV serves  as the
              scientist's "notebook" permitting him/her to move among  databases, hypotheses,
              reports, charts, etc.  ReV is being designed  for scientists in nuclear
              engineering and for scientists engaged in  global change research. As computers
              become integral to the moment-  by-moment work practices of scientists,
              well-designed tools become  critical.  This project, then, serves as a model
              for how scientist-  centered computing environments can be developed and
              deployed.
