Abstract    :
              The principal investigator, in collaboration with Dr. Charles                  
              Guidotti of the University of Maine, will study the crystal                    
              chemistry of coexisting biotite, muscovite, and chlorite from                  
              several different representative rock provenances. Electron                    
              microprobe, Mossbauer, and other analytical techniques will be                 
              utilized. The work will lead to a better understanding of the                  
              location of vacancies in the structures of these minerals. It also             
              will lead to a better understanding of the chemical substitutions              
              that occur in the minerals and of the controls on the partitioning             
              of ferric iron and hydrogen among crystallographic sites in the                
              minerals, as well as between mineral pairs. These data will be of              
              importance to geologists who use these minerals to estimate the                
              geologic conditions of formation of rocks in which the minerals                
              occur.
