Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project represents a collaboration between a leading                      
              theorist and a well-respected observer to attack in a detailed                 
              manner the questions of the nature and evolution of radio sources              
              in clusters of galaxies.  An extensive data base of some 300                   
              cluster radio sources will be prepared, and theoretical modeling               
              of the evolution of these sources will be tested against that                  
              data.  Radio, infrared, and optical data will be utilized, and                 
              various extensions of the standard model for these sources will                
              be tested, as well as alternative evolutionary models.
