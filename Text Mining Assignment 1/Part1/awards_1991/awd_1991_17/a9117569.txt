Abstract    :
                   This project involves detailed taxonomic, biostratigraphic,               
              and paleoenvironmental analyses of previously unstudied Lower                  
              Cambrian fossil faunas and stratigraphic units in Central Nevada               
              (Shoshone, Toiyabe, and  Toquima Ranges).  This research will                  
              provide the following:  1) detailed descriptions of the Lower                  
              Cambrian stratigraphic units; 2) descriptions of the local Lower               
              Cambrian faunas; 3) paleoecological analyses of Lower Cambrian                 
              facies; and 4) biostratigraphic correlations with other Lower                  
              Cambrian units in western North America.  This information will                
              then be applied to more general problems of the Early Cambrian                 
              including:  1) the temporal pattern of diversification during the              
              Cambrian radiation event; 2) tests of the Grand Cycle hypothesis               
              of sediment accumulation in the Lower Cambrian of western North                
              America; 3) biogeographic relationships of Early Cambrian metazoan             
              faunas; 4) reconstruction of the phylogenetic relationships of the             
              early metazoan taxa; and 5) documentation of the influence of                  
              changing paleoecologies on the actual nature of the radiation event            
              (as well as its apparent record).  In short, the goal of this                  
              project is to produce the detailed stratigraphic and paleontologic             
              data critical to understanding Early Cambrian metazoan evolution               
              and the processes responsible for the Cambrian radiation event.
