Abstract    :
              The principal investigators will study interatomic potentials as               
              applied to the computer modelling of silicate materials. The                   
              potentials that are developed will be tested with molecular                    
              dynamics simulations of the elastic properties of high-pressure                
              phases. They also will be applied to the high-pressure melting of              
              silicate minerals, the shock wave behavior of minerals and melts,              
              and the evaporation of silicates and oxides in relation to the                 
              accretion of early solar nebula.
