Abstract    :
                   The Eocene-Oligocene transition (about 42 to 30 million years             
              ago) was the most significant episode of climatic change and mass              
              extinction since the demise of the dinosaurs.  The extinctions                 
              during this transition have been attributed to many causes,                    
              including meteorite or cometary impacts, volcanism, and climatic               
              cooling due to Antarctic glaciation and oceanographic changes.                 
              Recent research has shown that the most dramatic changes occur                 
              between the  middle and late Eocene.  The Trans-Pecos region of                
              Texas is the only place in North America where this change is                  
              recorded by superposed mammalian faunas datable by both                        
              radiometrics and magnetostratigraphy.  There is no place in North              
              American the contains interfingering marine/non-marine sequence of             
              this age, so this area is the key to unlocking the details of the              
              Uintan-Duchesnean-Chadronian transition in land mammals.                       
                   The Trans-Pecos rocks contain a number of well studied faunas             
              of middle Eocene (Uintan) and late Eocene (Duchesnean and                      
              Chadronian) age.  Although preliminary paleomagnetic studies have              
              been on some these rocks, many of the key fossil localities, and               
              most of the Uintan and Chadronian parts of the section, have never             
              been sampled.  This project will collect and analyzed paleomagnetic            
              samples from most of the key localities, and provide new 40Ar/39Ar             
              dates to improve the geochronology.  It will then be possible to               
              correlate Uintan, Duchesnean, and Chadronian faunas from all over              
              western North America to the magnetic polarity timescale.  Episodes            
              of extinction and faunal change can then be examined in greater                
              detail, and correlated more precisely with the global record of                
              climatic and biotic change during the Eocene-Oligocene transition.
