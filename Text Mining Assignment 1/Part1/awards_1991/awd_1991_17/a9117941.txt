Abstract    :
                   The Cascadia convergent margin in northwest Washington State              
              marks the subduction boundary between North America and the Juan               
              de Fuca plate.  The Olympic mountains consist of an assemblage of              
              Eocene to Miocene thrusts structurally overlain by Eocene basalts              
              and Eocene to Miocene clastic rocks.  Uplift of these rocks                    
              occurred during the late Miocene.  These observations and available            
              fission track data have resulted in a tectonic model involving                 
              accretion and underplating followed by uplift while accretion                  
              continues.  This project will test between two end-member                      
              explanations for the timing and style of the uplift, simple doming             
              or large scale normal faulting.  Methods include fission track                 
              dating and structural analysis.  Results should help understanding             
              causes of uplift in active convergent orogens.
