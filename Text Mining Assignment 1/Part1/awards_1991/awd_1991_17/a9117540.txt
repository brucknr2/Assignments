Abstract    :
                   The utilization of tritium as a hydrological tracer and as an             
              isotopic age-constraint is becoming increasingly more difficult as             
              tritium concentrations decrease in global precipitation.  The                  
              proposed study can make an original contribution to the science of             
              hydrology by determining if and how low concentrations of                      
              environmental tritium (0-35 tritium units) can be utilized to                  
              better understand the hydrochemical systematics of runoff                      
              generation.  The proposed study will be conducted within the 190               
              km2 Falling Creek basin in the Piedmont Province of Georgia.  This             
              study will acquire and interpret major ion, stable oxygen isotope,             
              and tritium data derived from precipitation, surface water (under              
              a wide range of flow conditions), the vadose zone and the saturated            
              zone within the Piedmont regolith.  The results of this study will             
              lead to a better understanding of (1) the rates and mechanisms of              
              natural water movement and chemical processes within watersheds and            
              (2) how future regional hydrological investigations may continue               
              to utilize tritium.
