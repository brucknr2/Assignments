Abstract    :
                   Fluid exerts significant mechanical and chemical effects on               
              virtually all crustal processes.  Recent observations suggest that             
              elevated pore pressures may exist in a range of crustal                        
              environments, including mature fault zones and accretionary                    
              complexes.  Quantitative modeling of the generation and maintenance            
              of overpressure in most of these problems requires a fundamental               
              understanding of the relation among permeability, porosity and                 
              stress.  This is an experimental program to determine permeability             
              and porosity changes in porous aggregates (sandstones, hot pressed             
              quartz, and ODP samples) under triaxial compression conditions.                
              Microstructural observations, acoustic emission measurements and               
              percolation modeling will be integrated in the study so as to gain             
              a fundamental physical understanding of compaction/dilatancy and               
              hydraulic transport in the crust.
