Abstract    :
              The variability of the broad emission lines in the spectra of                  
              active galactic nuclei reveals fundamental information about the               
              structure and kinematics of the line-emitting region and about the             
              nature of the central source.  The work to be supported by this                
              grant will provide, for the first time, detailed, model-independent            
              mappings of the structure of active galactic nuclei.  The goal of              
              this program is to determine the structure and kinematics of the               
              braod-line emitting regions in active nuclei through repeated                  
              observations of a limited number of sources.  This is information              
              about active galactic nuclei which cannot be obtained in any other             
              way.                                                                           
                                                                                             
              The Principal Investigator is regarded as one of the leaders in                
              this area of research.
