Abstract    :
              The objective of this research is to undertake a comprehensive                 
              study of the ways in which properties of single sinus and atrial               
              cardiac cells such as voltage-dependent membrane currents, ion                 
              pumping mechanisms, calcium buffering and release systems, and                 
              inter-cellular gap junction conductance, influence the generation              
              and propagation of electrical activity in models of the sinus                  
              node, atrium, and combined sinus node - atrial networks.  Cell                 
              models will be based on whole-cell voltage-clamp data obtained                 
              from sinus and atrial cells isolated from rabbit heart.  Networks              
              will be modeled as two-dimensional lattices, with neighboring                  
              cells interconnected by resistors representing gap junctions.                  
              Network stat equations will be integrated on a massively parallel              
              supercomputer, the Connection Machine CM-2, in order to                        
              facilitate simulation of very large systems of cells.  The models              
              will be used to study the mechanisms which influence the                       
              generation and propagation of pacemaker activity in normal                     
              cardiac tissue.  Mechanisms giving rise to arrhythmias in                      
              localized groups of cells, and factors affecting the propagation               
              of arrhythmic activity through model networks will also be                     
              investigated.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              The proposed research will enhance our basic understanding of                  
              both normal and abnormal cardiac dynamics, and is unique in that               
              it represents an attempt to understand the "macroscopic"                       
              properties of large networks of cardiac cells give detailed                    
              descriptions of the "microscopic" behavior of individual cells.
