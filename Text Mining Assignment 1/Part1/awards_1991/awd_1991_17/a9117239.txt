Abstract    :
              Detailed mapping and sampling of the lowermost volcanics of the                
              Blosseville Coast succession were undertaken by the PI and student             
              in 1989.  This material, supplemented by samples from the                      
              University of Copenhagen and Greenland Geological Survey                       
              collections, provides the framework for these detailed geochemical             
              and experimental studies.  The plan is to conduct major and trace              
              element analyses of whole rock samples, microprobe studies of                  
              mineral phases, and Sr, Nd and Pb isotope analyses of selected                 
              whole rocks and pyroxene separates to establish temporal changes               
              in magma composition during the transition from continental rifting            
              to oceanic spreading.  Complementary experiments are proposed to               
              characterize the compositional relations for "damp" melting of                 
              mantle lherzolite and to define the liquid line-of-descent of                  
              parental magmas for Blosseville Coast basalts.  These geochemical              
              and experimental results will form the basis for modelling East                
              Greenland basalt petrogenesis and for an evaluation of proposed                
              physical models of early rifting in the North Atlantic.
