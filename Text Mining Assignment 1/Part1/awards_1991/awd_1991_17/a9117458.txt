Abstract    :
              This award is for support of a two year study to measure cosmic                
              ray produced nuclides to obtain surface exposure ages of glacial               
              moraines.  The goal of the research is to use this technique to                
              constrain the chronology of Antarctic glaciations.  One of the                 
              priorities will be to obtain new dates for the Late Wisconsin                  
              Ross Sea Drift.  Helium-3, Beryllium-10, and Aluminum-26 will be               
              measured together whenever possible but there will be an emphasis              
              on Helium-3 measurements in the younger rocks.
