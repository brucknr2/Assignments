Abstract    :
                   This award will provide for one-half the funds necessary to               
              acquire an isotope-ratio-monitoring gas chromatography mass                    
              spectrometer. The University of Hawaii has committed the additional            
              funding required for this acquisition. This instrumentation will               
              be used in a variety of geologic and oceanographic research                    
              programs in the School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology,              
              University of Hawaii. Present need for this instrumentation is                 
              great and will be even greater in the future. Current research                 
              requires the ability to analyze carbon, oxygen,nitrogen,sulfur, and            
              hydrogen isotopic compositions of samples and on-line carbon                   
              isotopic compositions of individual organic compounds. Equipment               
              presently at Hawaii cannot now,nor in the future be up-dated to                
              meet their current research needs. The acquisition of this mass                
              spectrometry system will provide them with the capabilities to meet            
              current demands as well as give them the flexibility to add new                
              technologies in the future.
