Abstract    :
              This project will make measurements of trace atmospheric gases that            
              are important to increase our understanding of the annual antarctic            
              ozone hole.  The gases are chlorine monoxide, ozone and nitrous                
              oxide, the first of which is a unique produce of the destruction of            
              ozone by chlorine.  Nitrous oxide is a valuable tracer of the                  
              dynamics of the atmosphere, and such measurements should be useful             
              in determining the degree of stratospheric subsidence during the               
              polar winter.  The measurements will be made with a millimeter                 
              wavelength radio spectrometer, similar to that which has been used             
              by this same investigator in McMurdo, Antarctica in previous years.            
                                                                                             
              This project is important for understanding how man-made chemicals,            
              such as the chlorofluorocarbons, can cause global changes.
