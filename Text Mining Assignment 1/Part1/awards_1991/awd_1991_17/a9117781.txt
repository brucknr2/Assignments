Abstract    :
                This research is a continuation of highly successful seismic                 
              body wave investigations of the earth's mantle.  Efforts now will              
              be directed towards the upper 300 km and lower 300 km (D" layer)               
              of the earth's mantle, regions that appear to have the most                    
              lateral variation in seismic velocities.  This information is                  
              critical to resolution of models of convection in the mantle, the              
              major driving force for plate tectonics and earthquakes.  D" will              
              be investigated by means of precursory arrivals to the PKP phase               
              along with constraints from other core phases such as ScS, Sdiff,              
              SKS, etc.  The upper 300 km of the mantle around the Hawaiian                  
              Hotspot will be investigated with multiple bounce S-wave                       
              techniques.  The lithosphere beneath portions of the U.S. and                  
              Canada will be investigated by means of Pn and Sn phases.
