Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Results of research in the past decade clearly suggest an excellent            
              potential for electrohydrodynamic (EHD) technique in heat transfer             
              augmentation of organic media with low-electrical conductivity.                
              Many of the newly identified refrigerants have poor heat transfer              
              characteristics, but appear to have a low enough electrical                    
              conductivity to qualify for the EHD enhancement.  An exploratory               
              experimental research effort is proposed to investigate the                    
              effectiveness/applicability of EHD heat transfer augmentation of               
              three environmentally acceptable (Ozone-safe) refrigerants.  The               
              selected refrigerants are R-22, R-123 and R-134a, which are                    
              believed to most likely represent the core of future non-azeotropic            
              working fluids for residential/commercial air conditioning and heat            
              pumping systems.  The potential of EHD boiling heat transfer                   
              augmentation of these refrigerants will be studied as a function               
              of electric field parameters (applied voltage and electrode                    
              geometry/orientation) and heat transfer surface characteristics                
              (smooth and enhanced configurations).  Should results of this                  
              initial investigation be encouraging, a more comprehensive future              
              proposal will be submitted whereby systematic study of the problem             
              both experimentally and analytically can be conducted.
