Abstract    :
              Greater Antarctica was in tropical latitudes and part of                       
              east Gondwana during the Cambrian.  A recent hypothesis                        
              postulates: (i) that the North American and combined                           
              Australian/East Antarctic cratons were juxtaposed in the                       
              Late Proterozoic, and (ii) that their Pacific-facing margins                   
              were initiated as a conjugate rift pair during latest                          
              Proterozoic-Early Cambrian interval.  This award supports a                    
              test of this hypothesis because its acceptance has profound                    
              implications of shared geologic history.  This work will                       
              compare in detail Cambrian events and faunas, concentrating                    
              in regions where the two continental masses are inferred to                    
              have been closes:  south-western United States and the                         
              Queen Maud-Pensacola mountains segment of Antarctica.
