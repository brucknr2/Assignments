Abstract    :
              The PI will investigate energy release in solar flares by:                      
                  (i)  incorporating a nonuniform guide field and/or a larger               
              coronal density in the electron-heated models in order to try and              
              suppress the blueshifted component of the soft X-ray line                      
              profiles, thereby bringing them more into line with observation;               
                   (ii) exploring models to explain the hard X-ray/soft X-ray                
              correlation;                                                                   
                   (iii) developing our impulsive coronal energy release model               
              to include line-tying effects and (non-adiabatic) conductive and               
              convective cooling;                                                            
                   (iv) investigating the role of the high-energy radiation                  
              itself in the flare energy budget.
