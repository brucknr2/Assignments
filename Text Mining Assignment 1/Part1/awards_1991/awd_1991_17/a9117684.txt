Abstract    :
              This project is to use negative thermal ionization mass                        
              spectrometry techniques to examine the 187Re-187Os isotope                     
              systematics of the Pechenga ferropicrites and associated Ni-Cu ores            
              (Kola peninsula, USSR).  The specific objectives of this research              
              are:  1) to obtain information about the Os isotopic compositions              
              of the mantle sources for these rocks, and constrain the                       
              geochemical behavior of Re and Os doing mantle melting and the                 
              subsequent crystal-liquid differentiation that produced these                  
              compositionally diverse suites, and 2) to utilize the Re-Os system             
              as a tracer for determining the sources of noble metals contained              
              in the Pechenga ores.  Ultimately, because of the geochemical                  
              characteristics of Re and Os, the Re-Os system will provide new                
              insights into the chemical evolution of the mantle and crust, and              
              lead to a better understanding of noble metal ore formation.
