Abstract    :
                   Exhumed, orogen-parallel shear zones are commonly found to                
              contain conflicting sense-of-shear indicators, especially where (1)            
              the pre-shear structures were not homogeneous, (2) local                       
              perturbations modified the flow patterns, or (3) the shear zone is             
              overprinted by later structures.  This study will examine anomalous            
              shear sense indicators in the Brevard Zone of the southern                     
              Appalachian Blue Ridge and Inner Piedmont, where late stage                    
              ductile, brittle-ductile and brittle structures occur.  The results            
              of this study will provide important information on the kinematic              
              history of this major orogen-parallel deformation zone.
