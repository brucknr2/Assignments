Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  A state-of-the-art electron microprobe will replace the                   
              University of Hawaii's 12-year old instrument. The new microprobe              
              will provide an enhanced beam stability for long duration, trace               
              element analysis; improved backscatter detector and analog-to-                 
              digital image capabilities; stage automation for detailedmineral               
              profiles; and computer automation for data/image collection and                
              processing.  The University of Hawaii will provide $250,000 and                
              NASA an additional $150,000.
