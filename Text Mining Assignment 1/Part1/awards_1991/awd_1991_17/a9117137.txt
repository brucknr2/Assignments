Abstract    :
              This multi-agency award will continue and extend the services                  
              provided by BIOSCI, and electronic newsgroup network which serves              
              as a vehicle for communications between members of the                         
              international biological sciences community.  In addition to forums            
              for communications in specialized scientific fields, these services            
              include newsgroups for experimental methods, scientific meeting and            
              other general announcements, and journal contents/abstracts.                   
              Newsgroups dedicated to various aspects of the Genome Project are              
              also in use.  Electronic newsgroups have the potential to                      
              revolutionize communications among scientists, and their use will              
              be actively promoted among the biological community through                    
              demonstrations, training sessions, and assistance with installation            
              of news software.  The newsgroups will be expanded.  Archives of               
              bulletins will be maintained for retrieval by FTP and e-mail.  A               
              database of all newsgroups dedicated to the biological sciences                
              will be maintained along with a directory of electronic mail                   
              addresses of biological scientists.
