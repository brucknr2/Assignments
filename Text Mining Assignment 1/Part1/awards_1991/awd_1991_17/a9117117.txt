Abstract    :
              In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the                       
              Chemistry Division, Professor Charles Parmenter of Indiana                     
              University will study crossed-beam bimolecular energy transfer,                
              intramolecular vibrational redistribution, and vibrational                     
              predissociation in van der Waals molecules.  The aim is to                     
              reveal the state-resolved characteristics of vibrational energy                
              flow in polyatomic molecules, both intramolecular and                          
              collisional.  There will be a synergism between this                           
              experimental work and theoretical treatments by collaborating                  
              theoretical chemists.

              When excess energy is deposited into vibrational modes of                      
              polyatomic molecules, that is, those composed of several atoms,                
              that energy can dissipate internally by redistributing among                   
              the other vibrations in the molecule, or it may be given up to                 
              other atoms or molecules with which the excited molecule                       
              collides.  This project aims at studying the ways and time                     
              scales on which such excess vibrational energy flows out of the                
              initially excited parts of a molecule.
