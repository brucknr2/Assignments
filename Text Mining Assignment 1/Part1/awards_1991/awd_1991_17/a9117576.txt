Abstract    :
              Compositionally disparate or bimodal magmas simultaneously                     
              occupying the same chamber have been inferred since the very                   
              beginnings of igneous petrology.  This award supports                          
              a series of field-based investigations, centered around the                    
              diabase sills of Antarctica, some of which are perhaps the                     
              best examples of bimodal fractionation (solidification front                   
              instability-?SFI!), and augmented by experimental and                          
              analytical investigations, to delineate the physics and                        
              chemistry of SFI.  Similar, complementary field studies will                   
              also be undertaken at the Stott Mountain, Oregon, and Zora,                    
              Pennsylvania involving, silicic lenses in gabbro and voluminous                
              bulbous granophyre at their upper contact of a large diabase sheet.
