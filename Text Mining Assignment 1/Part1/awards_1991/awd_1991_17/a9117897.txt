Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The objective of this study is to determine the source and target              
              cells for a growth factor (EGF). Furthermore, because it has been              
              shown to stimulate anterior pituitary corticotropes, the aims will             
              determine if pituitary EGF-producing cells respond to the same                 
              stimuli that activate secretion from the corticotropes namely                  
              stress and corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH). To identify the              
              source of EGF, labeling protocols that localize messenger                      
              ribonucleic acid (mRNA) to EGF will be done. The source cells will             
              then be further identified by dual labeling for pituitary hormones.            
              Once the source cells are identified, their responses to                       
              stimulation by stress or CRH will be determined to learn if they               
              can be activated by increasing EGF mRNA. Aim                                   
              target cells for EGF. EGF receptors on these cells will be labeled             
              either with a biotinylated analog of EGF or antibodies to the EGF              
              receptor. Then these cells will be identified further with labels              
              for the hormones. The source cells will then be enriched and                   
              stimulated to secrete. The media will be used with corticotropes               
              to determine if the cells secrete biologically active EGF. The                 
              specificity of the reaction will be determined by adding antisera              
              to EGF to neutralize any EGF activity.
