Abstract    :
              This project is to model the evolution of lithospheric and                     
              asthenospheric magma source regions during the tectonic transition             
              of the Rio Grande Rift by examining the chemical, mineralogical,               
              textural, and volcanological characteristics of volcanic suites                
              produced episodically from 50 to 3 Ma in southern New Mexico.                  
              Major element, trace element, and isotopic (Sr, Nd, and Pb)                    
              compositions will provide constraints on the nature of                         
              magma-producing regions (asthenosphere, lithospheric mantle, lower             
              crust, upper crust) as well as the processes involved in magma                 
              evolution.  40Ar/39Ar age determinations on key units will place               
              temporal constraints on thermal evolution of the lithosphere.
