Abstract    :
                This research is to analyze shear-wave splitting in the upper                
              mantle in two areas in western South America, a volcanic area                  
              southwest of Bucaramanga in western Colombia, and a large non-                 
              volcanic area in central Peru.  This analysis will involve data                
              from both local and teleseismic earthquakes and will be used to                
              compare to results obtained at Bucaramanga where splitting was                 
              ascribed to a wedge-shaped anisotropic volume in the upper mantle              
              immediately above the Wadati-Benioff zone, especially in a                     
              volcanic versus a non-volcanic setting.  The results will bear on              
              models of deformation of the mantle due to the subducting slab                 
              and thereby on the mechanism of earthquake generation in one of                
              the world's most active seismic areas.  This research is a                     
              component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
