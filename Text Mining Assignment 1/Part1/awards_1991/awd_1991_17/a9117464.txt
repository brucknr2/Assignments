Abstract    :
                This research is to continue analysis of earthquake data                     
              collected in the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake aftershock series by              
              means of the PASSCAL seismic instruments.  This data will be                   
              augmented by the USGS Calnet stations and other portable arrays                
              and refraction data.  The current project is solving for Vp/Vs in              
              a single-step inversion.  The next step is to iteratively solve                
              for Vp and Vp/Vs.  A 3-dimensional image of the subsurface                     
              properties will be determined which will be used to investigate                
              properties of rocks at depth relative to locked versus creeping                
              portions of the San Andreas fault.  The results will also be used              
              to improve locations of earthquakes in the region to investigate               
              geometry of faults and the complex tectonic system.  This                      
              research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard                      
              Reduction Program.
