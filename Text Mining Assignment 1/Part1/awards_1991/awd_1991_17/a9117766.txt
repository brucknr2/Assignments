Abstract    :
                   This award provides for approximately 22% of the total amount             
              needed to acquire a gas chromatograph-isotope ratio mass                       
              spectrometer. The additional funding necessary for this acquisition            
              has been committed by DOE and the University of Oklahoma. This                 
              instrument will be used to determine the isotopic composition of               
              individual components in complex organic mixtures in sedimentary               
              detritus derived from diverse geologic source materials. Individual            
              components in Recent sediments, oil, source rock extracts, or                  
              pyrolysis products can be separated via GC, combusted to carbon                
              dioxide, and their isotopic composition determined in real time.               
              Isotopic data currently in the literature for organic matter in                
              sediments of varying age are typically average values of all                   
              organic components in the mixture;it has been impossible or                    
              exceedingly difficult and expensive to determine the isotopic                  
              composition of individual components using traditional techniques.             
              The isotopic composition of the individual components will be used             
              as biomarkers and may be valuable in reconstructing the                        
              paleohistory of sediments containing these materials.
