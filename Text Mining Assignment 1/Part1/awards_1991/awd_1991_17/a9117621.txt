Abstract    :
              Research on fear of failure has indicated that women avoid                     
              experiences rather than risk the possibility of failure or                     
              uncertainty.  The present study will examine constructive risk-                
              taking among a group of women who are in nontraditional occupations            
              and who have chosen to work in the Antarctic.  Models of fear of               
              failure also indicate that what is fearful about failure for                   
              women is the possibility of negative social consequences.  A                   
              second purpose of the present study is to examine how women low                
              on fear of failure cope with the social consequences of                        
              constructive risk-taking, and also to examine the existing social              
              supports for women in the Antarctic.  The isolation and                        
              environmental features of the Antarctic have applications for                  
              other confined microsocieties that some women will be                          
              experiencing in the near future.  A third purpose of the study is              
              to investigate five factors concerning the Antarctic experience                
              for women that have previously only been studied with men.                     
              Structured interviews will be conducted with women who have                    
              recently returned from the Antarctic.  The results will be used                
              to generate quantitative measures and to formulate theories of                 
              risk-taking and social coping among women in nontraditional                    
              roles.
