Abstract    :
              Myxococcus exhibits multicellular gliding movements that are highly            
              coordinated.  Coordination spans the range of few to many thousands            
              of cells.  While growing, a dozen cells may associate and move as              
              a cohort.  In fruiting body development, many thousands of cells               
              move coordinately.  The aim of this project is to work out the                 
              cellular and molecular basis for movement coordination.  Despite               
              the apparent complexity of their movement, myxobacterial cells have            
              the structural, chemical and genetic simplicity of Gram-negative               
              bacteria.  Previous work on Myxococcus had distinguished two                   
              motility patterns called "adventurous" and "social".  This project             
              will seek to identify many of the genes that control social                    
              motility.  The motors responsible for gliding movement have not yet            
              been uncovered in any of the gliding bacteria.  A new way to find              
              the genes that specify gliding motors is proposed.  One gene, the              
              mglA gene, is known from previous work to be essential for all                 
              gliding and to couple adventurous and social motility.  Mutants                
              defective in this gene are unable to move under any conditions.                
              Experiments are proposed to define the function of mglA on the                 
              pathway that regulates cell movement.  Multicellular movements are             
              particularly important in the embryonic development of vertebrates,            
              but little is known about how they are organized or regulated.                 
              Myxobacteria offer a realistic way to begin to investigate this                
              general problem.
