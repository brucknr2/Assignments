Abstract    :
              This project is in the general area of analytical and surface                  
              chemistry and in the subfield of spectrochemical analysis.  During             
              the tenure of this three year continuing grant, Professor Marcus               
              and his students will develop and evaluate radio frequency glow                
              discharge (rf-GD) devices as spectrochemical sources for direct                
              solids elemental analysis by atomic emission, atomic absorption,               
              and mass spectrometric methods.  The rf-GD approach is                         
              particularly advantageous for the analysis of non-conducting                   
              solids that do not yield to sputtering/atomization by graphite                 
              furnace or other more conventional approaches.  Four specific                  
              thrust areas for investigation are (1) development of methods for              
              quantification in rf-GD mass and emission techniques, (2)                      
              characterization of excitation/ionization processes in rf-GD, (3)              
              exploration of pulsed and variable frequency plasma operation, and             
              (4) development of an rf-GD atomic absorption atomizer.

              This research addresses an area of spectrochemical analysis which              
              is of major technological importance.  It builds upon results                  
              obtained under NSF grant CHE-8901788 and should provide the basis              
              for the rapid and reliable direct elemental analysis of glass,                 
              ceramic, and other nonconducting solid materials.
