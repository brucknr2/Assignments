Abstract    :
                   The project will establish a modern taxonomic base for studies            
              of biostratigraphy, biogeography, and evolution of the middle                  
              Cretaceous (Albian) faunas (predominantly ammonites) of the Pacific            
              rim of North America and will refine the biostratigraphic standard             
              of reference for this interval in the Cottonwood District of                   
              northern California.  A detailed standard of reference is                      
              prerequisite to an understanding of paleobiological problems of                
              biofacies, biogeography and patterns of evolution, and for                     
              chronostratigraphy.  It is also needed for stratigraphic and                   
              structural problems requiring a high degree of biostratigraphic                
              resolution.                                                                    
                   Such a study would:  1) elucidate the microstructural,                    
              morphologic, and ontogenetic characteristics of many unstudied                 
              ammonite taxa; 2) would enable some evolutionary sequences to be               
              recognized and their patterns to be examined; 3) permit examination            
              of hypotheses of ammonite evolution proposed by German, Russian,               
              and French writers; 4) enable a refined correlation of the Lower               
              Cretaceous strata around the Pacific rim with the classical                    
              sections in Europe and with sequences originating in the Tethyan               
              seaway, e.g. Caucasus, Indian; 5) enable paleobiogeographic and                
              biofacial interpretations some of which are now masked by                      
              antiquated taxonomy; 6) permit a better understanding of the                   
              history of the region and its faunas; 7) permit a more balanced                
              view of the Cretaceous history of North America; 8) permit                     
              assessment of proposed mid-Cretaceous extinction events.
