Abstract    :
              The principal investigators will study mineral behavior at high                
              pressures and temperatures and attempt to relate changes in crystal            
              structure under such conditions to changes in physical and                     
              thermodynamic properties. They will collect X-ray and Raman                    
              spectroscopic data in-situ, and analyze the data in light of Landau            
              theory. This work should lead to a better understanding of the                 
              behavior of materials in the Earth's crust and upper mantle.
