Abstract    :
              The principal investigators, in collaboration with Dr. Frank Spera             
              of the University of California/Santa Barbara, will study the                  
              atomistic and thermodynamic properties of H2O systems using                    
              computational techniques. The main aim is to theoretically predict             
              the behavior of H2O under temperature and pressure conditions that             
              are impractical for direct experimentation. Data such as these will            
              be especially valuable to earth scientists studying the behavior               
              of H2O-bearing systems that exist deep within the Earth.
