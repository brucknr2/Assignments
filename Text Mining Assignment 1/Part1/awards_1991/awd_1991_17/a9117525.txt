Abstract    :
                   The Lewis and Clark line which extends from northern Idaho to             
              southwestern Montana separates a number of large-scale tectonic                
              features of several ages.  The origin and development of the Lewis             
              and Clark line are complex and poorly understood.  This project                
              will attempt to unravel the multiple-phase tectonic evolution of               
              the Lewis and Clark line by mapping, kinematic analysis and                    
              thermochronology.  The results are expected to enhance our                     
              knowledge of the Lewis and Clark line and its role in the develop-             
              ment of the North American Cordillera.
