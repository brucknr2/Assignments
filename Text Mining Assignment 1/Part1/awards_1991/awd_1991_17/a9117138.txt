Abstract    :
              This research project, supported jointly by the Analytical and                 
              Surface Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division and the                    
              Solid State Chemistry Program of the Division of Materials                     
              Research, addresses key questions of geometric and electronic                  
              structure of magnetic surfaces and interfaces.  Professor                      
              Klebanoff will develop and apply methods of spin resolved X-ray                
              photoelectron spectroscopy, photoelectron diffraction, and                     
              surface extended electron loss fine structure spectroscopy to                  
              characterize the magnetic properties of thin films of                          
              magnetically active elements deposited on well characterized                   
              single crystal metal substrates.  Initial work will concentrate                
              on the interfacial magnetic properties of Cr layers deposited                  
              on the Fe(100) surface, and will be extended to other                          
              ferromagnetic systems including Fe, Co, Ni, and Gd.

              An understanding of the magnetic and structural properties of                  
              the surfaces and interfaces of magnetically active materials is                
              of tremendous importance to the magnetic recording industry and                
              to the design and manufacture of magnetically active electronic                
              components.  This research program will develop powerful new                   
              methods for the characterization of the magnetic structure of                  
              thin layers of magnetically active materials, and apply them to                
              the study of model systems.  Information obtained from these                   
              studies will provide data crucial to the design and                            
              understanding of magnetic surfaces and interfaces.
