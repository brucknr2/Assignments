Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award supports Dr. Sutton's program in interstellar                       
              spectroscopy at submillimeter wavelenghts.  Part of the work is                
              instrumental.  An existing 345 GHz receiver system will be modified            
              to operate at 500 GHz and, ultimately, other submillimeter bands.              
              This receiver system will then be used for an observational program            
              which emphasizes studies of galactic structure, regions of star                
              formation, and interstellar chemistry.  In addition, further                   
              analysis and interpretation will be carried out for several ongoing            
              projects based on data obtained at 345 GHz.                                    
                                                                                             
              Submillimeter observations can provide unique information about the            
              interstellar medium, information not available at millimeter or                
              other wavelengths.  High frequency spectral lines sample denser,               
              higher excitation regions, making them vital probes of molecular               
              cloud cores.  Previously submillimeter observations had been                   
              limited by a lack of suitable telescopes and receiver systems. A               
              number of high quality submillimeter telescopes have become                    
              available in the past few years, placing greater emphasis on the               
              need for sensitive receiver systems such as the one to be developed            
              by Dr. Sutton.
