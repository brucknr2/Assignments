Abstract    :
                   Two conflicting tectonic models exist for similar aged                    
              Proterozoic terranes in New Mexico and Arizona.  In Arizona,                   
              previous work indicates an end to tectonism and metamorphism by                
              1600 Ma, whereas in New Mexico, recent work suggests major tectonic            
              and metamorphic events during the interval 1450-950 Ma.  This study            
              will focus on four key areas in New Mexico with the specific                   
              objective of relating the existing 40Ar/39Ar spectra to the tectonic,          
              metamorphic and granite intrusion events.  Detailed field                      
              observations on regionally important ductile shear zones and their             
              wall rocks, and on plutons and their aureoles, will determine the              
              relative ages of fabrics in the rocks.  Laboratory work on the                 
              structural and metamorphic fabrics, together with P-T-t                        
              determinations using new 40Ar/39Ar determinations will resolve the             
              spatial relationships of the differently aged rocks to shear zones             
              and pluton emplacement.  The results will have important                       
              consequences for the Proterozoic tectonic history of SW USA.
