Abstract    :
                   The Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites provide a                  
              powerful new tool for accurate geodetic measurements. Vectors                  
              between GPS receivers can now be measured with accuracies of one               
              centimeter out of a baseline of 100 kilometers in the horizontal               
              and 3-5 centimeters in the vertical direction. One major                       
              contribution to the degradation of vertical positioning is                     
              inadequate correction for time delays of GPS signals caused by                 
              water vapor in the troposphere. The "wet-path delay" can be                    
              measured directly, in principle, using water-vapor radiometers                 
              pointed along the line-of-sight to GPS satellites. However,                    
              definitive line-of-sight experiments have not yet been performed.              
                   This project will perform a definitive radiometer test by                 
              operating line-of-sight meters at two permanent GPS sites in                   
              California. Tests will be conducted for two separate one-month                 
              sessions during different seasons of the year. The object is to                
              develop wet-path delay correction techniques that optimize vertical            
              GPS positioning accuracy.
