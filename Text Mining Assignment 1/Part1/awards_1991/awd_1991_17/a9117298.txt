Abstract    :
              Theory of Electrons in Solids - Electronic properties of                       
              semiconductor heterostructures, including energy and spin                      
              relaxation, will be studied as functions of confinement of the                 
              electrons by the structural formation and as functions of electron             
              interaction among themselves and with other excitations.   Specific            
              systems for the proposed study are lateral superlattices on vicinal            
              plane quantum wells for both III-V and silicon/germanium composites            
              and p-type quantum wells.  The theory of optical properties in                 
              these systems will be investigated and used to predict and to                  
              understand observed optical phenomena.  In particular, the time                
              evolution of the optical spectra with specific polarizations will              
              be studied on a picosecond scale.  Study of the electronic                     
              interaction will also be extended to solids with narrow electronic             
              bands.                                                                         
              %%%                                                                            
              Semiconductor heterostuctures are layered composite structures                 
              having at least one very small dimension.  Such structures are                 
              being investigated intensively for application, particularly as                
              optoelectronic devices.  This project will examine issues central              
              to such applications, including the effect of the minute size on               
              energy and spin relaxation.  The optical properties, both static               
              and dynamic, of this class of artificially structured materials                
              will be examined.  These studies are aimed at understanding the                
              intrinsic effect of the heterostructure design on the desired                  
              characteristics, including optical frequency range, bandwidth, and             
              sensitivity of the ultamate device.
