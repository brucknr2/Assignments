Abstract    :
              This grant is for partial support for a two-day symposium,                     
              "Medical and Biological Engineering:  A Celebration of the Past                
              and Challenges of the Future".  The symposium, featuring                       
              prominent engineers and scientists, is the culmination of a two-               
              year effort to establish a new organization (American Institute                
              for Medical and Biological Engineering) that will catalyze the                 
              interaction of the currently fragmented segments of medical and                
              biological engineering.  It is expected that the new organization              
              will play a major role in the further development of the rapidly               
              growing field of bioengineering.
