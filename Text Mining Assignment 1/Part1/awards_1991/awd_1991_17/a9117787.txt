Abstract    :
                   This award will provide for half the funds needed to acquire              
              a theta-theta diffractometer. The additional funding necessary for             
              this acquisition has been committed by Harvard University. The                 
              requested instrument- a high precision theta-theta diffractometer              
              with associated X-ray generator,counting electronics,and computer              
              for control and data analysis- will replace obsolete powder                    
              diffractometers(25-30 years old) for both routine and precision                
              measurement of powdered samples of minerals,rocks,and other                    
              materials. The PI is an experienced researcher with a fine track               
              record. He and a large number of faculty and student users should              
              benefit greatly by having a state-of-the-art instrument available.
