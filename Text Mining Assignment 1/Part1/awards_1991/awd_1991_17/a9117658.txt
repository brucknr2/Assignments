Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The aim of this project is study ion channel activities on the            
              inner and outer membranes of mitochondria. Patch clamping will be              
              used to assess channel activity on native mitochondrial membranes              
              and on isolated liposomal membranes into which mitochondrial                   
              channel proteins have been reconstituted. These studies will                   
              contribute to our understanding of ion movements in the context of             
              mitochondrial function.                                                        
                                                                                             
              The regulation of ion movement across mitochondrial membranes is               
              not well understood, but apparently involves several classes of                
              proteins that operate as pumps or as channels. The focus of this               
              work is on channel proteins that facilitate the passive movement               
              of ions across either the inner or outer membrane of the                       
              mitochondrion. An electrophysiological technique known as patch                
              clamping will be employed to study the activity of these proteins              
              either in their native membranes, or in a reconstituted artificial             
              membrane system. Patch clamping will be used to assay the ion flux             
              activities through certain channels under a variety of conditions.
