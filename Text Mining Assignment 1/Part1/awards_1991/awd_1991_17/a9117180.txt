Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The chorion genes of Drosophila melanogaster are expressed in                  
              distinct spatial and temporal patterns in female follicles                     
              (eggchambers) and provide a powerful system for molecular analysis             
              of developmental gene expression.  To dissect the molecular                    
              mechanisms governing spatial expression, the PI has identified and             
              cloned CF4: a DNA-binding protein which interacts with sequences               
              of the s36 chorion gene.  CF4 contains a novel DNA-binding domain.             
              The PI will focus on the molecular biology and developmental                   
              genetics of CF4 to confirm its involvement in regional-specific                
              chorion gene expression by:  examining the temporal and spatial RNA            
              and protein distribution of CF4 in follicles, initiating molecular             
              and biochemical studies, and using a genetic approach for                      
              identifying existing or generating new mutations using the FLP                 
              recombination system to generate genetic mosaic follicles, and he              
              will also develop a GALA directed follicle-specific gain of                    
              function assay and examine the effect of CF4 ectopic expression.//
