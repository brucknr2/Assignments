Abstract    :
                   The Pontide range in northern Turkey presents a paleo-                    
              geographical paradox.  The geological data available favor the                 
              Pontides as part of the Eurasian plate since the mid-Jurassic                  
              closure of the PaleoTethys Ocean, but three independent paleo-                 
              magnetic studies that were unconstrained by fold tests have                    
              indicated paleolatitudes significantly different from that of the              
              Eurasian plate margin.  This study will resolve the apparent                   
              discrepancy by field work and the use of modern paleomagnetic                  
              techniques on Jurassic and Cretaceous volcanic and sedimentary                 
              rocks in the Pontides.  The results will have important                        
              implications for paleogeographic reconstructions and plate motions             
              since the Jurassic and will help resolve the tectonic complexities             
              along the margins of the Eurasian and African plates.
