Abstract    :
              This research aims to develop sensitive and selective chemical                 
              sensors for potential applications in environmental monitoring,                
              automated manufacturing processes and medical monitoring.  The                 
              collaborative project involves two PI's, one at Purdue University              
              and the other at Sandia National Laboratories, in an effort to                 
              synthesize and characterize new thin films with molecular                      
              recognition capabilities.  Three different synthetic approaches                
              will be explored:  (i) Zeolite-glass microcomposites; (ii) thin-               
              films with template controlled porosity; and (iii) surface                     
              crystallized channel structures.  This work is part of the                     
              Materials Chemistry and Chemical Processing Initiative, and it is              
              jointly funded by the Chemistry Division and the Division of                   
              Materials Research.
