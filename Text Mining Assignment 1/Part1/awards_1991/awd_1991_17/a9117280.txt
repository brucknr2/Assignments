Abstract    :
                   The objective of this work is to advance the capability of                
              measurement techniques towards the ultimate objective which is to:             
              Measure the temperature dependence of the elastic constants (and               
              velocities) of high pressure phases of mantle minerals in the                  
              temperature range of the lower mantle.  The objectives of this work            
              are to 1) advance the temperature capability of elastic constant               
              measurements from 1800 K to 2000 K, 2) to decrease the size of the             
              sample measured to sub-millimeter size, 3) to measure iron-bearing             
              minerals at these high temperatures, and 4) to measure the thermal             
              expansivity between 1500 K and 2000 K on a variety of mantle                   
              minerals.  The methods employed will be to 1) use old and new                  
              techniques of resonance ultrasound on small single crystals of                 
              various shapes, and 2) to construct a laser interferometer capable             
              of high temperature dilametric measurement.  The significance of               
              this work, is that it will allow a higher certainty of isolating               
              the mineralogy of the earth's lower mantle, and that it will                   
              greatly augment the thermodynamic database which will be useful for            
              geochemistry and mineralogy.
