Abstract    :
              In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program                 
              of the Chemistry Division, Professor Gutowsky of the University                
              of Illinois at Urbana will use high-resolution rotational                      
              spectroscopy to gain structural information of small cluster                   
              molecules created in supersonic jet expansions.  The clusters                  
              are formed by van der Waals, electrostatic, or hydrogen bonding                
              forces.  Cluster isomers, high-temperature species, and                        
              excited-state and high-energy conformational forms are among                   
              the species to be studied.  This work should help elucidate the                
              mechanism by which inter- and intramolecular forces govern the                 
              dynamics of condensed-phase forms.

              Cluster molecules are the intermediate species formed when                     
              gaseous molecules condense to form liquids or solids.  The                     
              study of the structure and properties of clusters is useful in                 
              understanding such diverse phenomena as molecular orientation                  
              and mobility on catalytic surfaces as well as protein folding.                 
              The work supported here examines clusters formed by a number of                
              different forces, from very weak physical attraction to almost                 
              chemically strong bonds.
