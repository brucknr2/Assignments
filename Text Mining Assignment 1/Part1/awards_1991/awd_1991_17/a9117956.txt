Abstract    :
                   The Turkana Basin of Kenya and Ethiopia has long been known               
              as a critical locality for the understanding of vertebrate                     
              evolution in East Africa.  The geologic record of the basin spans              
              a broad range, including Cretaceous through Holocene sediments with            
              intercalated volcanics.  Cretaceous through Oligocene history has              
              yet to be characterized, but Miocene to Holocene strata are well-              
              known.  They record the stratigraphic evolution of the basin from              
              a volcanically active, localized sediment trap, to an integrated               
              fluvial basin with periodic lacustrine phases, and finally to a                
              structurally-controlled rift basin.  Research over the past decade             
              on the context of vertebrate evolution in the basin has greatly                
              altered our perspective on the history of the region and                       
              development of the East African Rift.  Within the stratigraphic and            
              temporal framework established for vertebrate studies, it is now               
              possible to examine in detail the evolution of the region in terms             
              of its volcanic, tectonic and sedimentary history, and to                      
              reevaluate the history of geologic processes in this portion of                
              Africa.  We intend to focus our attention on the unstudied southern            
              portion of the Turkana Basin, and to investigate exposures in the              
              Loiyengalani region, the Chalbi Desert, on Mt. Kulal, and in the               
              Suguta and Kerio Valleys.  Understanding of the geologic record                
              from these regions is critical to evaluating the history of major              
              geologic events in the basin, including basin integration,                     
              hydrographic connections, and structural development.
