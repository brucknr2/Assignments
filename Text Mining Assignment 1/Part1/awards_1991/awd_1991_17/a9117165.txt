Abstract    :
              This is an award to  provide support for research on the                       
              capacity of picoplankton populations in aquatic                                
              environments to take up and store heavy metals.  The                           
              investigators plan on investigating the use of an                              
              analytical technique involving x-ray dispersive analysis                       
              in conjunction with electron microscopy to determine the                       
              elemental composition of individual cells and their                            
              intracellular components.  They plan on identifying                            
              specific heavy metal sequestering organisms isolated from                      
              samples obtained from aquatic field locations where waters                     
              and underlying sediments are relatively rich in cadmium,                       
              nickel, mercury and other heavy metals.                                        
                                                                                             
              The role of microorganisms in the environmental cycling of                     
              metals is of importance in bioleaching, biosorption,                           
              processing of fossil fuels, and in biotreatment processing                     
              of municipal and industrial wastewaters.  The removal of                       
              heavy metals from waters contaminated with them is a also                      
              a matter of considerable interest as their presence may                        
              adversely affect environmental water quality.  Results of                      
              this research may be applied to modeling the diffusion,                        
              dispersion and interactions of heavy metals of                                 
              significance in affecting the quality of environmental                         
              waters.
