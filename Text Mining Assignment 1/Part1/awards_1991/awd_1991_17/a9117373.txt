Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will produce a more sensitive and more flexible                   
              version of a previously developed laser/Schottky-diode based                   
              600-900 GHz heterodyne receiver for the CSO.  The improvements will            
              make feasible a broad range of astronomical projects.  The new                 
              receiver will be used to make exploratory studies of high frequency            
              submillimeter lines to investigate problems in the study of                    
              photodissociation regions, ultra-dense star-forming regions, and               
              hot molecular outflows from protostars.  Part of the plan involves             
              making the high frequency capability of the CSO receiver available             
              to other members of the community.  This effort is part of a                   
              collaborative effort to produce an SIS system using a frequency-               
              agile laser as the first L.O.
