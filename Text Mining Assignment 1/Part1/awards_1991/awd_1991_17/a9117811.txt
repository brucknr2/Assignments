Abstract    :
                This research is to utilize the Connection Machine, a massively              
              parallel computer supporting 32,768 linked but otherwise                       
              independent CPU's, to compute the transmission of a guided wave                
              in a low-velocity fault zone.  Such waves have been observed at                
              Parkfield, California, but standard computational codes are not                
              adequate to model the phenomena.  The results can be applied to                
              mapping faults such as the San Andreas in greater detail than has              
              been possible to date.  This research is a component of the                    
              National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
