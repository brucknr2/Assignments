Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The normal program of early embryonic development is initiated                 
              when an oocyte is fertilized by a sperm.  The mechanism by which               
              sperm activate oocytes and the role of sperm components in this                
              process and in later stages of embryogenesis are not understood.               
              This project takes a combined genetic and molecular approach to                
              studying this problem, using the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans               
              as a model system.  The PI has already identified a gene that                  
              encodes a sperm-supplied product that is required for initiation               
              of the correct program of early embryonic development in C.                    
              elegans.  Mutations in this gene, called spe-11, result in                     
              paternal-effect embryonic lethality: wild-type oocytes, when                   
              fertilized by sperm from mutant worms, undergo very abnormal                   
              early development and die.  This is not due to the presence of a               
              "poisonous product" in mutant sperm but to reduced levels or                   
              absence of wild-type product.  Thus, wild-type spe-11 product                  
              participates, either directly or indirectly, in initiating the                 
              normal program of early development in C. elegans.  This project               
              has two major aims: 1) To clone and molecularly characterize the               
              spe-11 gene, and localize the spe-11 gene product in sperm and                 
              newly fertilized embryos.  2) To carry out screens for additional              
              paternal-effect embryonic-lethal mutations, which will identify                
              other genes that encode sperm-supplied factors required for                    
              normal embryo development.  This effort will complement the                    
              wealth of information on oocyte factors and will begin to define               
              the sperm's contributions to early embryogenesis.
