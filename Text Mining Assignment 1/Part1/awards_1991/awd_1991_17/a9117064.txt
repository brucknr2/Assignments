Abstract    :
                   This proposal is for the establishment of an                              
              Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Polymer                    
              Interfaces at Lehigh University.                                               
                   The focus of the Center is on developing a molecular level                
              understanding of the structural, dynamic, kinetic, and energetic               
              characteristics of the interphase region between a polymer and                 
              substrate.  This will be accomplished through detailed                         
              characterization of industrially relevant model/polymer substrate              
              systems using laser light scattering, inverse gas chromotography,              
              impedance specroscopy, XPS, Raman, NMR, FTIR etc.                              
                   Companies from the aerospace, petrochemical and                           
              microelectronic industries will profit from these studies.                     
                   The Program Manager recommends a continuing award for $50,000             
              for a five-year period.                                                        
                   Near the end of each 12 month period the Program Manager                  
              and/or the Director of the Engineering Centers Division will review            
              the progress of the Center on a number of criteria, including the              
              following:  1) the extent to which the university-industry                     
              interaction and collaboration is developing; 2) the extent to which            
              the support base is expanding; 3) the extent to which a robust                 
              research program is developing.  If the review is satisfactory, the            
              Program Manager will recommend support of the next period of this              
              continuing award.
