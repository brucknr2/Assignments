Abstract    :
                   This award provides one-half the funds for the acquisition of             
              a high-performance workstation and for the upgrade of existing                 
              computer hardware housed in the Department of Earth and                        
              Environmental Sciences at Lehigh University. The University is                 
              committed to providing the remaining funds necessary.                          
                   The equipment will be used primarily in the work of the                   
              reflection seismology laboratory group which processes and                     
              interprets seismic data. The main research focus of the seismology             
              group at Lehigh is regional seismic surveying over a wide range of             
              crustal imaging scales and resolutions from tens of meters to tens             
              of kilometers. The techniques include both wide-angle and vertical             
              incidence profiling to image subsurface structure and stratigraphy             
              and to measure subsurface material properties. Computer modeling               
              studies are used to constrain the interpretation of the data. All              
              of these activities are computer-intensive and require the in-house            
              capability that this equipment provides.
