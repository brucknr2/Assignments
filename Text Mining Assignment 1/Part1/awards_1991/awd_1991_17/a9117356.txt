Abstract    :
              This award will help to promote U.S.-Greece                                    
              collaboration between Prof. Costas Soukoulis of Iowa                           
              State University and Prof. E.N. Economou of the                                
              University of Crete.  The aim of the proposed work                             
              is to conduct research in the area of disordered                               
              systems; in particular, to understand the                                      
              fundamental mechanisms responsible for the                                     
              localization of light and other classical waves in                             
              random systems.                                                                
                                                                                             
              Until recently, most of the work on localization has                           
              focused on electronic systems.  Classical wave                                 
              localization offers both the potential for a direct                            
              check of localization theory as well as the                                    
              possibility of understanding other characteristics                             
              distinct from those of electrons.  However, strong                             
              localization of light has not been experimentally                              
              observed yet.  What these experienced collaborators                            
              intend to do is to improve our theoretical                                     
              understanding of the conditions under which                                    
              localization of light, or more generally,                                      
              electromagnetic waves, can occur and make available                            
              several configurations that will improve the search                            
              for the effect.
