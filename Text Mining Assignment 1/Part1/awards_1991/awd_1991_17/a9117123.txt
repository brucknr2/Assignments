Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This proposal is centered on regulatory controls for DNA                  
              replication in the macronucleus of the heterotrich, Euplotes. DNA              
              replication in the macronucleus of this protozoan is highly                    
              localized into an easily-visualized replication band. The primary              
              working hypothesis is that posttranslational modifications of                  
              specific histones are required for both the activation and                     
              inactivation of the replication process. The experiments focus on              
              the phosphorylation of histone H1 at specific residues as necessary            
              facets of both activation and inactivation of replication.                     
              Acetylation of histones H3 and H4 may also be important regulatory             
              steps in the process. Replication origins will be sought in the                
              telomeric regions of the chromosomes. These experiments will                   
              contribute to our overall understanding of DNA replication.                    
                                                                                             
              The replication of DNA in eukaryotic cells is usually initiated at             
              multiple sites along each of the chromosomes. Euplotes is a                    
              protozoan that exhibits an unusual level of spatial order in the               
              pattern of DNA replication in its macronucleus, where all                      
              replication occurs in a small region. This high order in the                   
              replication pattern makes this organism particularly amenable for              
              studies of the process. In this study, experiments are focused on              
              regulatory aspects of DNA replication. Experiments will test                   
              whether the phosphorylation and acetylation of specific histones,              
              at specific sites are controlling factors in the replication                   
              process. Other experiments are directed at testing whether the                 
              replication origins reside exclusively at the telomeric ends of the            
              chromosomes. This proposal will contribute to our overall                      
              understanding of DNA replication.
