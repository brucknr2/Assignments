Abstract    :
              This research investigates an advanced heterogeneous database                  
              environment for engineering design, with emphasis on using design              
              knowledge and relating design decisions to design versions. The                
              environment uses a blackboard approach to coordinate, integrate,               
              and monitor product development. An object-oriented database                   
              provides an integrated, logical view of complex design entities                
              that are stored in a variety of databases. Designers therefore                 
              have a global view of how heterogeneous data repositories form                 
              the complete product design. The blackboard also coordinates                   
              access to expert systems and deductive databases to provide                    
              engineering design knowledge. Design histories are captured as a               
              series of design development steps and the corresponding                       
              engineering knowledge is used in each step and resulting                       
              decision. Both navigational and knowledge-based approaches to                  
              querying design histories are used. The impact of this research                
              on database technology will be the advancement of heterogeneous                
              databases through the use of object-oriented concepts to achieve               
              a tightly-coupled view of design data. Object-oriented concepts                
              will also be extended with a process model for capturing and                   
              querying design histories.  This research will also lead to the                
              improvement of the engineering design productivity by providing                
              an integrated view of design knowledge and data and by supporting              
              the ability to query design histories allowing re-use of previous              
              designs.
