Abstract    :
                   Information on crustal fluids and their role in deformation               
              processes is obtainable from the investigation of fluid inclusions,            
              mineral phase equilibria and stable isotopic composition of rocks              
              and minerals.  These three approaches will be combined in a study              
              of fluid-rock interaction in two granulite grade shear zones of the            
              S. Grenville Province, Ontario and New York.  This study will test             
              the hypothesis that CO2-rich primary fluid inclusions in the shear             
              zones record late movements during which the minerals did not                  
              isotopically re-equilibrate.  The results will help constrain                  
              pressures and temperatures during high-grade deformation and thus              
              have important significance for the tectonics of deep-seated                   
              continental crust in orogenic belts.
