Abstract    :
              Fractional crystallization is one of the most important yet most               
              poorly understood of all igneous petrologic processes.  One key to             
              understanding how fractional crystallization operates is through               
              the study of magmatic cumulates generated during a composition                 
              gap-forming event.  This study will include detailed textural                  
              (Universal-Stage), geochemical, micro-probe and, most                          
              significantly, ion-probe investigations of the Medicine Lake                   
              cumulates.  Textural studies will concentrate on the degree of                 
              preferred mineral orientation.  Geochemical studies will                       
              characterize the major and trace element variability in both the               
              cumulates and associated magmas.  Micro-probe and ion-probe studies            
              will determine major and trace element zonation styles in                      
              individual cumulate minerals, as well as the degree of sympathetic             
              compositional variation among neighboring cumulate minerals.                   
              Altogether, these complimentary lines of evidence will be used to              
              assess the physical nature of fractional crystallization at                    
              Medicine Lake and, by inference, in other calc-alkaline magmatic               
              systems of similar style.
