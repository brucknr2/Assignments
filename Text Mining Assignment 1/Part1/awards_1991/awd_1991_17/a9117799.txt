Abstract    :
              With the goal of elucidating molecular mechanisms by which                     
              calmodulin-activated enzymes aid transformation of CA2+-signals                
              into biochemical responses, this project addresses                             
              relationships between structure, function, and regulation of                   
              the type II calmodulin-dependent protein kinase.  The major                    
              target is a recombinant, monomeric form of the kinase which                    
              contains catalytic and regulatory domains but lacks the                        
              association domain.  Site-specific mutagenesis will be used to                 
              produce additional forms of the kinase and calmodulin.                         
              How Mg2+, calmodulin, substrates, and autophosphorylation                      
              regulate domain folding, interactions, and topographical                       
              arrangements will be a major focus.  Chemical crosslinking and                 
              active site-directed reagents will be used to probe sequences                  
              of events in kinase activation.  Fluorescent probes will be                    
              attached to specific sites of calmodulin and the kinase for                    
              fluorescence and energy transfer studies; suitable metal ions                  
              and nucleotide analogs provide additional fluoroprobes.                        
              Changes in circular dichroism and in the susceptibility of the                 
              protein to proteolytic cleavage will be correlated with                        
              corresponding changes in kinase activity and calmodulin-                       
              dependence.  The X-ray structure of the truncated kinase will                  
              be determined in a collaborative project.  Current working                     
              models of the structure and regulation of this prominent                       
              calmodulin-dependent enzyme will be refined by computer                        
              modeling.
