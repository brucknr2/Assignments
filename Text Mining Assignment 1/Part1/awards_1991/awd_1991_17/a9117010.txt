Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award supports the participation of 15 U.S. scientists in a               
              U.S.-Japan Seminar on Membrane Fusion:  Approaches to Molecular                
              Mechanisms in Biological and Model Membranes.  The co-organizers               
              of the seminar are Dr. Demetrios Papahadjopoulos, Cancer Research              
              Institute, University of California, San Francisco, and                        
              Dr. Shun-ichi Ohnishi, Department of Biophysics, Kyoto                         
              University.  It will be held November 8-12, 1992 in the Kyoto                  
              International Conference Hall.  The topics to be discussed                     
              include:  fusion of model membranes, fusion induced by peptides                
              and proteins, fusion of viruses with liposomes and erythrocyte                 
              ghosts, fusion of viruses with cell membranes, cell-cell fusion,               
              fusion of myoblasts and sperm-egg fusion, molecular mechanisms,                
              and intracellular transport and fusion.                                        
                                                                                             
              Membrane fusion is a ubiquitous phenomenon in biological                       
              systems, but the molecules that regulate it and its molecular                  
              mechanisms are largely unknown.  Many groups around the world                  
              have taken a variety of approaches to the problem and are                      
              studying different biological and model membrane systems.                      
              Japanese investigators have been at the forefront of research on               
              the mechanisms of virus-cell and virus-induced cell-cell fusion.               
              Dr. Ohnishi's laboratory is a center for the development of                    
              innovative ideas in membrane fusion.  The laboratory of Dr.                    
              Papahadjopoulos is a center for the development of new assays for              
              membrane fusion and for investigations on the role of lipids and               
              proteins in membrane fusion.  This seminar will strengthen ties                
              that already exist among the U.S. and Japanese investigators and               
              provide a forum for the generation of new ideas and                            
              collaborations.
