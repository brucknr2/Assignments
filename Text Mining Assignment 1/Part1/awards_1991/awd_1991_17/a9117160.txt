Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This grant is to support a symposium to be co-sponsored by the                 
              Developmental and Structural Section of the Botanical Society of               
              America at its annual meeting in conjunction with the Annual                   
              Meeting of the American Institute of Biological Sciences in                    
              Honolulu, HI, 9-13 August 1992.  The goal of the symposium is to               
              present an overview of the current knowledge of root development               
              and structure and to stimulate research on plant roots.  Topics                
              will include gene expression patterns related to cell and tissue               
              differentiation in root apical meristems and tissues, cell cycle               
              regulation, root cell and organ elongation related to plant growth             
              regulators, graviperception, root apical meristem organization,                
              and control of differentiation processes.  The presenters will also            
              discuss technical and protocol advancements which have helped to               
              elucidate their research problems, and they will discuss the                   
              importance of their research within the world of plant biology.
