Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This static/dynamic light scattering system will be used for                   
              polymer studies.  It is critically important to a number of                    
              research areas within the department including studies of the                  
              absorption dynamics of the air/vapor interface, adsorption of                  
              functionalized polymers on surfaces, polymer transport in gels,                
              studies of inonmer solutions, and local conformations of                       
              polyelectrolytes, among many others.  This capability will                     
              enhance ongoing polymer materials research in areas such as                    
              adsorption, chain conformation, chain transport, and mechanical                
              properties.
