Abstract    :
                This research is to develop a better theory governing the                    
              propagation of Love and Rayleigh surface waves on a laterally                  
              heterogeneous earth model.  The theory uses a slowly varying                   
              Lagrangian method to develop a JWKB theory that is then extended               
              in a JWKB-Maslov manner to be valid near caustics, that is, near               
              the source and antipode of the surface waves.  Unlike other                    
              theories, this then will be applicable over the entire earth.                  
              The resulting computer program will be applied to the study of                 
              surface wave amplitude variations including geometric focusing                 
              and defocusing, laterally heterogeneous anelasticity, and                      
              earthquake source directivity.  This research is a component of                
              the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.
