Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award funds continuation of a very active research program in             
              extragalactic astronomy by one of the pioneering groups in the area            
              of Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI),  In addition to                   
              providing correlator services for Mark II VLBI observations                    
              throughout the U.S.  and much of the world, these researchers will             
              continue their investigations of active galaxies, and attempt to               
              discriminate between a number of competing models for these                    
              objects.  They will also be active in the first use of the Very                
              Long Baseline Array of radio-telescopes, both as users of this new             
              instrument and a developers of software for data reduction and                 
              analysis for that facility.
