Abstract    :
              Wyatt         The primary goal of this research is to design and test  analog
              VLSI systems for applications of real-time machine vision.   In real-time
              machine vision the sheer volume of image data to be  acquired, managed and
              processed leads to communications  bottlenecks between imagers, memory and
              processors, and to very  high computational demands.  The goal is to determine
              how the  advantages of analog VLSI--high speed, low power and small area--  can
              be exploited and its disadvantages--limited accuracy,  inflexibility and lack
              of storage capacity--can be minimized.   The work is concentrated on early
              vision tasks, i.e., tasks that  occur early in the signal flow path of animal
              or machine.   Proposed designs include chips for camera velocity estimation, 
              depth from stereo, image segmentation and smoothing, surface  reconstruction,
              wide-range brightness adaptive imaging, and  automatic fiducial mark alignment
              for wafer fabrication.  MIT's  earlier designs have shown that the typical
              subsystem is  physically very small and will perform one or more 
              computationally intensive image-processing tasks at hundreds-to-  thousands of
              frames per second using only tens-to-hundreds of  milliwatts.
