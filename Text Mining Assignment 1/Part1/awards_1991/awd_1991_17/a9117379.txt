Abstract    :
                   This project involves the Caribbean bluehead wrasse,                      
              Thalassoma bifasciatum.  It has two major objectives:  Through                 
              experimental manipulation, it will investigate the causal                      
              relationship between natural selection and male features that                  
              prior correlation studies have suggested to be important.  Other               
              investigations have assumed that particular features convey                    
              fitness, but have not established the causal connection through                
              experimentation.                                                               
                   The experiments in this section represent the first                       
              comprehensive field investigation into the direct fitness                      
              consequences to females for expressing a mating preference.                    
              Through a series of successive removals and replacements of males              
              on a reef, females will be repeatedly challenged to make choices               
              among males who are highly variable in a feature shown to be                   
              important in mate choice.  From this, one can estimate                         
              consistency and variability of mate choice among females, the                  
              consequences of expressing a choice in terms of fecundity,                     
              fertilization rate, and growth, and also identify the source of                
              the  benefit (male or female).  The results have important                     
              applications in sorting through alternative explanations for the               
              evolution of mating preferences.
