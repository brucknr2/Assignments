Abstract    :
                   Since 1979, the resurgent dome of Long Valley caldera,                    
              California has risen more than 50 cm apparently  due to the                    
              injection of 0.2 km3 of magma at depths.  Several earthquakes (>6.0)           
              accompanied the initial uplift; the USGS has warned of possible                
              eruptive activity.                                                             
                   Floodplain evidence from the Owens River suggests that the                
              current uplift is part of a long term inflation that may total 15-             
              35 meters.  Most of the lower river displays two recent parallel               
              meander belts (200-300m apart), similar in meander wavelength and              
              amplitude, but unequal in age.  The older, invariably closer to the            
              dome and 30-60 cm higher in elevation, now carries an underfit                 
              stream and is being abandoned.  The new lower channel formed by                
              avulsion, apparently triggered by uplift.  As many as four older,              
              separate meander belts exist and suggest that two cycles of uplift             
              and subsidence may have preceded the current inflation.                        
                   The proposed research would involve the following                         
              investigations.  (1) We will make a series of detailed leveling                
              surveys perpendicular to the valley axis to define the pitch of the            
              interfluvial surface as an estimate of domal uplift, (2) We will               
              determine ages for oxbow sediments from the several meander belts              
              using a combination of tephrochronology and 14C (forest fire                   
              charcoal and possible peat) to define the length of time that the              
              river occupied each of these meander belts.  These ages will help              
              define both the times of uplift and subsidence as well as the                  
              possible correlation between river channel migrations and eruptive             
              activity in the Inyo and Mono Crater fields.  (3) We will compare              
              historic and modern photographs of the river to determine recent               
              rates of channel migration and compare them with the local degree              
              of floodplain tilting determined in the leveling surveys.                      
                   An understanding of the recent history of the resurgent dome              
              is of central concern to residents of Mammoth Lakes, CA.  The                  
              proposed investigation offers undergraduate students an excellent              
              opportunity to study both in the field and in the laboratory an                
              important example of silicic volcanism, as well as an interesting              
              phenomenon in fluvial geomorphology.
