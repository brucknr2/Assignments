Abstract    :
              This award is for support of a project to investigate the                      
              mechanics acting at the margins of Ice Stream B, Antarctica.                   
              An analysis of existing temperature data near the center of                    
              the ice stream and of surface shear strain rate at its                         
              margins indicates that strain heating in the margins should                    
              be easily measurable in holes of 300 to 400 m depth.                           
              Temperature will be measured in a line of hot water drilled                    
              holes bracketing one of the margins, and interpreted in                        
              terms of strain heating, possible strain softening of the                      
              marginal ice, the shear stress acting on the ice stream, the                   
              history of the ice stream, and the stability of the margins.                   
              A secondary objective is to confirm the existence of diurnal                   
              variation in the vertical straining of the ice, which was                      
              previously observed on Ice Stream B.
