Abstract    :
              The principal investigator will study the kinetics and mechanisms              
              of aqueous oxidation of pyrrhotite. Under a variety of physical and            
              chemical conditions, rates of reaction will be studied using                   
              Mossbauer techniques. Surface-sensitive techniques will be utilized            
              to detect transient Fe and S species. The work will lead to a                  
              better understanding of the production of acid mine drainage, the              
              formation of gossans above ore deposits, and the development of                
              seafloor iron ochre deposits derived from black smoker particulates            
              and sulfide chimneys at ocean spreading centers.
