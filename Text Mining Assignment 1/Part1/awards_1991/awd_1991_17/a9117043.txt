Abstract    :
              This is an award to support research on the factors that                       
              affect the rate of flocculation of particles in water                          
              suspension when subjected to contacts with metallic salt                       
              coagulants and coagulant aids used in processes for                            
              treatment of water.  Experimental variables being                              
              considered are the effects of temperature, coagulant                           
              dosage, pH, concentration of suspended substances and                          
              sulfate concentrations.  Research is being conducted at                        
              bench scale.  Coagulants include ferric and aluminum salts                     
              and the coagulant aids include cationic polymers.                              
                                                                                             
              Results of this project are expected to improve our                            
              understanding of flocculation, an important unit operation                     
              conducted in treatment of both water and wastewater.  This                     
              understanding is further expected to provide the basis for                     
              improvement in the engineering design of treatment systems                     
              that include flocculation as a unit operation, and in the                      
              improvement of existing treatment plants that use this                         
              process in their water treatment and wastewater treatment                      
              operations.
