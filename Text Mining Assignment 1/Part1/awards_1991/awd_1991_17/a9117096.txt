Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project, by one of the leading young investigators of star                
              formation in early type systems, continues his efforts in that                 
              area.  Studies of dust and molecular gas and their relation to                 
              star formation will be extended to edge-on spirals, dwarf                      
              galaxies, and M82-like systems.  Investigations of dust and                    
              molecular gas in the Milky Way will serve to relate our knowledge              
              of local star formation to the processes occurring in the more                 
              distant systems studied.
