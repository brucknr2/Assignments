Abstract    :
                   This is a theoretical study of the high pressure properties               
              of candidate mantle phases in order to better constrain the                    
              chemistry and mineral composition of the mantle.  Several important            
              and basic questions will be addressed, including: 1) phase                     
              transitions in SiO2 stishovite that would lead to extreme shear                
              elastic softening, 2) possible high temperature phase transitions              
              in MgSiO3, 3) bonding characteristics of iron in high pressure                 
              oxides, 4) search for new candidate high pressure-high temperature             
              phases, and 5) physical properties of mantle phases.  A combination            
              of the following theoretical techniques will be used: a) first-                
              principles electronic structure calculations using the Linearized              
              Augmented Plane Wave (LAPW) method, b) ab initio model methods that            
              make assumptions about bonding and ionicity but are many orders of             
              magnitude faster than LAPW, c) hybrid "constrained potential                   
              models" that correct the ab initio models to give better agreement             
              with the first-principles calculations, and d) lattice dynamics,               
              molecular dynamics, and Monte Carlo simulations using these                    
              potential to obtain temperature dependent properties.
