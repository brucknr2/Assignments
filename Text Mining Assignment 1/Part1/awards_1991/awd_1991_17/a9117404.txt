Abstract    :
                   This award provides partial funding for computer equipment to             
              be installed and operated in the Berkeley Seismographic Station and            
              the Department of Geology & Geophysics at the University of                    
              California, Berkeley. Additional support for acquisition of this               
              equipment is coming from the University and from the U.S.                      
              Geological Survey.                                                             
                   The dual goals of this equipment are to modernize the Berkeley            
              Seismographic Network, a regional network vital to earthquake                  
              monitoring activities in northern California and to earthquake                 
              research in general, and to provide computing capabilities to                  
              researchers in geophysics involved in earthquake research,                     
              seismological tomography, geodynamic modeling, equation of state               
              modeling in mineral physics, and additional computing-intensive                
              research projects.
