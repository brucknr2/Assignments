Abstract    :
              It has been suggested that the Pacific margins of the East                     
              Antarctic and North American Precambrian cratons were formerly                 
              juxtaposed, and that they drifted apart to initiate the                        
              Pacific Ocean during the fragmentation of a Neoproterozoic                     
              supercontinent.  The most critical and immediate testable                      
              evidence put forward in support of this hypothesis is the                      
              apparent continuation of the northwestern boundary of the                      
              Grenville orogen of the North American craton, the Grenville                   
              front, into East Antarctica at the head of the Weddell Sea                     
              between the Shackleton Range and Coasts Land, an area seldom                   
              visited and never studied in detail by American geologists.                    
              This award supports an initial test of the hypothesis, a                       
              geologic, geochemical, geochronometric, and paleomagnetic                      
              study of the Antarctic rocks in question, in order to compare                  
              them with those adjacent to the Grenville front in the                         
              southwestern United States.  The work will include detailed                    
              stratigraphic study of the only undisturbed Neoproterozoic                     
              sedimentary sequence in the Antarctic continent.
