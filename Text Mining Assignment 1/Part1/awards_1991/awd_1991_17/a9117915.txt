Abstract    :
                   The Piedmont of the Southern Appalachians has been shown to               
              involve major overthrusts of crystalline rocks, possibly due to                
              crustal delamination, but have also been shown to have evidence for            
              major extensional features of the Piedmont in the southern                     
              Appalachians is therefore controversial, with competing models                 
              having the same terranes both autochthonous with respect to North              
              America and exotic, and having major boundary faults extensional               
              in one model, compressional in another with strike-slip motion in              
              a third.  This collaborative, field-based project centers on                   
              establishing the history of the more important terranes and their              
              bounding faults.  The work involves mapping, petrology and age                 
              dating within the Belair, Savannah River and Carolina terranes near            
              Macon, Georgia, and on the Modoc fault which separates the Carolina            
              and Savannah River terranes.  Results are expected to resolve                  
              points of major disagreement among current tectonic models and                 
              provide a further means of testing the fundamentally important                 
              hypothesis that crustal delamination occurred at the onset of the              
              late Paleozoic Alleghanian orogeny.
