Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The primary objective of this research is use the evidence of                  
              buried soils to understand the habitat of one of the best known                
              early fossil apes called Proconsul some 17 million years old from              
              Rusinga Island, Kenya.  Proconsul belonged to an archaic group of              
              monkey-apes (proconsulids) widely considered ancestral to both                 
              the great apes and to early human ancestors                                    
              (australiopithecines).  The fossil apes are found along with                   
              other mammal fossils in soils buried within a sequence of river                
              deposits.  Some of the fossils are delicate skulls and                         
              articulated limbs that could not have been transported far from                
              where the animals lived.  Of the various kinds of soils buried                 
              within these stream deposits, Proconsul is consistently found in               
              one kind of buried soil.  The microscopic and chemical studies of              
              this proposal are aimed at determining exactly what kinds of                   
              soils these were when they formed, and thus where in the mosaic                
              of vegetation Proconsul                                                        
              lived.
