Abstract    :
              Research is proposed on three relatively low cost                              
              and manufacturable technologies for                                            
              microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), which                                   
              will contribute toward enabling commercial                                     
              development of these systems.  The first technology                            
              is a process for integrating optical-quality                                   
              compound semiconductor materials onto silicon-                                 
              based microstructures.  This technology, which is                              
              based on a modification of epitaxial liftoff                                   
              techniques for compound semiconductor materials,                               
              will enable the development of integrated optically-                           
              based sensors and actuators.  The second                                       
              technology involves the use of electroplating                                  
              techniques coupled with polyimide-based                                        
              electroplating forms to produce a low-cost                                     
              alternative to the LIGA process for fabrication of                             
              high-aspect-ration microstructures.  The third                                 
              technology involves the design and fabrication of                              
              simple solar cell structures that can be used as self-                         
              contained power sources for MEMS.  The solar cell                              
              structures will be optimized for the high-voltage,                             
              low-current needs of electrostatic microactuators,                             
              and designed such that they can be integrated                                  
              directly with standard silicon-based microstructures.
