Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will support a U.S.-Japan Cooperative                               
              Photoconversion/Photosynthesis Research Program project between                
              Professor Judith Croxdale, Department of Botany, University of                 
              Wisconsin, and Professor Kenji Omasa, Environmental Plant                      
              Science Section, National Institute for Environmental Studies,                 
              Tsukuba, Japan.  The project involves cooperative experiments to               
              examine whether, in the mesophyll of developing dicot leaves, new              
              cells that arise at multiple sites are coordinated by their position in        
              the developing leaf or by their cell lineage.  The question is one of          
              fundamental importance to plant developmental biology.                         
                                                                                             
              The function of clones in developing leaves will be studied by                 
              monitoring photosynthesis.  The development of the photochemical               
              apparatus will be determined by repeatedly imaging the kinetics of             
              chlorophyll a fluorescence in the clones.  Uniform function within             
              clones throughout their development will indicate regulation by cell           
              ancestry, while heterogeneity within clones will indicate the                  
              participation of other influences in the development of cellular               
              function.  Clones intersected by vascular tissue will be particularly          
              useful in assessing the contributions of other cell types on                   
              mesophyll differentiation.  Since the clones created will span the             
              entire period of leaf development, the investigators can determine if          
              there are "windows" during development when ancestry may                       
              control function, and other times when positional information may              
              regulate cellular development.
