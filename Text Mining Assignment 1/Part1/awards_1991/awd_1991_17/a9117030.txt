Abstract    :
                The Biological sciences produce a complex research literature                
              equivalent to thousands of megabytes every year. Research papers               
              have extensive and detailed information about procedures,                      
              information not captured in keywords or tables. New techniques                 
              are developed for storing and querying this data and knowledge.                
              This project combines the ongoing work in the Biological                       
              Knowledge Laboratory, which is amassing and codifying biology                  
              papers, with new technology for managing knowledge and databases.              
              The focus is on the logical text structure (title, abstract,                   
              sections, paragraphs) and the Materials and Methods sections                   
              (chemicals used, genetic strains, equipment, procedures).  The                 
              text structure can be treated as a schema in an object-oriented                
              data model. The Materials and Methods database is a complex                    
              knowledge base involving time-ordered events, computed rather                  
              than stored attributes, references to methods in other papers,                 
              etc. The techniques and concepts of object-oriented databases are              
              used for both types of information. Innovative indexing schemes                
              are developed to aid in search.  This new object-oriented                      
              database technology advances the understanding of the structure                
              of scientific knowledge as data and provides new tools for                     
              research scientists to access the complex knowledge contained in               
              the research literature.
