Abstract    :
                   Since 1980, at intervals of 2-3 years in the Spring, a large              
              international conference on Differential Equations and                         
              Mathematical Physics has been held at The University of Alabama                
              in Birmingham.  This conference has been very successful in                    
              bringing together scholars from around the world for fruitful                  
              scientific exchange in an active area in which modern                          
              mathematical analysis comes to grips with problems of scientific               
              importance.  The next scheduled conference in this series will                 
              take place at The Georgia Institute of Technology, 22-28 March                 
              1992.
