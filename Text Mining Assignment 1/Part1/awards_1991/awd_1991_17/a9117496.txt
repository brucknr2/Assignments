Abstract    :
                   Flights of elevated marine terraces near Cape Blanco, Oregon,             
              have soil chronosequences that include, from youngest to oldest,               
              Andisols, Spodosols, bisequal soils (Spodosols/Ultisols), and                  
              Ultisols.  The goal of the project is to determine the evolution               
              of geochemical processes in these soils.  Quantitative changes in              
              soil constituents over time will be determined from the geochemical            
              mass-balance approach and measurements of particle-size                        
              distribution, bulk density, extractable Fe, Al, Si, and C,                     
              exchangeable bases and acidity, and total elemental analysis (NAA              
              and XFA).  Thermodynamic stability indices will be estimated from              
              soil mineralogical data (petrography and XDA) and aqueous solution-            
              chemistry data (pH, redox potential, Fe, Al, Si, DOC, DIC in bulk              
              precipitation, canopy throughfall, and soil solutions collected)               
              using the GEOCHEM chemical-equilibrium model.  The geochemical mass            
              balances and modeling will be used to test hypotheses regarding the            
              origin of the parent materials (aeolian deposition vs. weathering              
              of beach sediments.  Soil-forming processes will be elucidated from            
              the forementioned data and microscopic analyses (soil                          
              micromorphology and SEM) of diagnostic soil features (melanic                  
              epipedons, placic and ortstein horizons, and argillic horizons).
