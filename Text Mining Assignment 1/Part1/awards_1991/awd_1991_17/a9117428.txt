Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Investigations are proposed of two-parameter bifurcations,                     
              wavenumber-selection processes and phase dynamics in non-linear                
              dissipative systems that are driven far from equilibrium.                      
              Experiments will concentrate on the rotating Couette-Taylor system,            
              with either axial flow or external rotation.  Results are expected             
              to have a bearing upon the general problem of pattern-formation and            
              the evolution of non-periodic phenomena in systems of significant              
              spatial extent.                                                                
                                                                                             
              This research aims at developing a clearer understanding of pattern            
              formation in non-linear, non-equilibrium systems.
