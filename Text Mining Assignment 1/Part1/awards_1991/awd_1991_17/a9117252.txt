Abstract    :
              Although the indole alkaloid ajmalicine, obtained from                         
              Catharanthus roseus, is not an important product in the                        
              U.S., it serves as a useful model for the development of                       
              an "enabling technology" for the efficient production of                       
              potentially more important compounds, such as taxol.                           
              Previous work has shown that combining four treatment                          
              strategies can result in a 50-fold increase in the                             
              extracellular production of ajmalicine.  These four                            
              strategies are:  (1) elicitation; (2)  production medium                       
              development; (3)  calcium alginate immobilization; and (4)                     
              in situ adsorption with XAD-7 resin.  They interacted                          
              synergistically, and were accomplished in batch reactors.                      
              Attempts with repeated batch cultivation revealed                              
              difficulties in sustaining a high level of production.                         
              This work seeks to answer the following questions:  (1)                        
              what factors cause the loss of productivity and                                
              alterations in cell physiology during prolonged culture;                       
              and (2) is continuous high-level production using the                          
              combined four strategies possible?
