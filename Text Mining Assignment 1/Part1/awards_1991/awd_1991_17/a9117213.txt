Abstract    :
                   This award provides 50 per cent funding for the purchase of               
              equipment to be installed and operated in the Paleomagnetics                   
              Laboratory of the Department of Geosciences at the University of               
              Arizona. The University is committed to providing the remaining                
              funds necessary to acquire the equipment.                                      
                   The equipment consists of a computer workstation, a pulse                 
              magnetizer, a magnetic susceptibility and anisotropy meter system,             
              and parts for rebuilding a thermal demagnetizer system. The                    
              Paleomagnetics Laboratory is engaged in a variety of research                  
              projects currently focussed on understanding the apparent polar                
              wandering paths extending back through the geologic past as                    
              reconstructed from rock paleomagnetic measurements. A better                   
              understanding of these measurements has important implications for             
              piecing together the history of the formation of continental                   
              masses.
