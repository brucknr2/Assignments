Abstract    :
                   This award will provide for half the funds needed to acquire              
              a computer-based image analysis system to facilitate research of               
              magmatic crystallization processes. Lamar University has committed             
              the additional funds necessary for this acquisition.The PI plans               
              to apply this relatively new approach to an on-going study of the              
              petrology of igneous rocks in the Stillwater Complex. He plans to              
              develop principles and techniques of quantitative petrographic                 
              analysis which can be used to analyse and understand process-                  
              related and kinetic aspects of a variety of igneous rock types.                
              This RUI award will make it possible to provide undergraduates                 
              with valuable and exciting research experience.
