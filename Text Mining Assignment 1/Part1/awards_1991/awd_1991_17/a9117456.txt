Abstract    :
              This award will support the Seventh International Conference on                
              Phonon Scattering in Condensed Matter, to be held at Cornell                   
              University in Ithaca, New York, on August 3-7, 1992.  The major                
              objectives of the conference will be the exchange of ideas                     
              concerning fundamental and pratical questions of the propagation of            
              elastic waves in condensed matter, and to expose students to as                
              many aspects as possible of this wide and important field.
