Abstract    :
              Modeling of the geochemical carbon cycle and its effect on                     
              atmospheric CO2 over Phanerozoic time (Berner, 1990;1991) has                  
              revealed the importance of knowing more about how land plants                  
              affect chemical weathering.  This includes the effect of plants on             
              the rate of uptake of CO2 by silicate and the feedback response of             
              weathering, with and without plants, to changes in CO2.  This                  
              project will investigate the role of plants in weathering by a                 
              field study on the island of Hawaii.  Hawaii offers a unique                   
              opportunity to study weathering because here there are:  (1) dated             
              basalts ranging back to more that 4000 years (2) a wide range of               
              plant life, from lichens and algae to well developed rainforest,               
              within small regions of constant bedrock lithology and constant                
              microclimate and (3) access to the expertise of biologists who are             
              presently studying plant ecology in the same area.  We plan to                 
              measure the thickness and mineralogical and chemical composition               
              of weathering rinds and soils on flows with an eye to comparing                
              relative rates of weathering in the presence and absence of                    
              specific biota.  Results of this work, when combined with results              
              from planned future studies of the effects of specific plants grown            
              at varying CO2 levels on weathering rate, will be employed on our              
              carbon cycle model to place some limits on how atmospheric CO2 might           
              have changed as a result of the rise of vascular plants over                   
              geologic time
