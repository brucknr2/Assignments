Abstract    :
              A potential use for scientific databases in the biological                     
              sciences involves the simulation of in vivo metabolic tracer                   
              experiments. The queries of interest in this area are difficult                
              to answer using existing technologies. The proposal suggests two               
              hypotheses: first, that complex biological processes can be                    
              modeled as logical enterprises comprising objects, processes and               
              constraint dimensions; second, that deductive database technology              
              is suitable for the computer realization of such models. To test               
              these hypotheses, the proposal focuses on the possible                         
              representations of compounds, biochemical reactions, and                       
              biochemical and physiological constraints, and the computational               
              consequences of the alternative representations.  The reactions                
              come chiefly from intermediary carbohydrate metabolism, and the                
              strength of the computational ideas will be evaluated by                       
              comparing the results with experimental data from the biological               
              literature. At the conclusion of the project, the strengths and                
              limits of the different representational schemes should be much                
              clearer.  The impact on biological sciences will be the                        
              development of a generic representational solution for a wide                  
              class of biological problems, while the computer science impact                
              will lie in the successful integration of the data and process                 
              aspects of the problem in a declarative, symmetric treatment. In               
              the long run it is expected that computer systems of this type                 
              will be used for predictive purposes and in the a prior                        
              assessment of in vivo experiments.
