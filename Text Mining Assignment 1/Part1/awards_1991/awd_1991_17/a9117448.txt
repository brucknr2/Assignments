Abstract    :
              This project is an observational study of the formation, evolution,            
              and dissipation of mesoscale cyclones along the coastline of the               
              antarctic continent, specifically in conjunction with intense and              
              persistent katabatic winds.                                                    
                                                                                             
              It has been known for some time that the higher southern hemisphere            
              latitudes are regions of decay for synoptic scale cyclones.  It has            
              however only recently been found that smaller mesoscale cyclones               
              can frequently occur over the sea ice and the adjacent coastal                 
              areas of Antarctica, and significantly affect the coastal climate              
                                                                                             
              This study will include both climatological and dynamical aspects              
              of mesoscale cyclones and will be based on observations by the                 
              array of automatic weather stations in the Terra Nova Bay region,              
              and the digital satellite data recorded at McMurdo Station.                    
              Specific tasks to be undertaken include the study of the dynamics              
              relating to the genesis of mesoscale cyclones, numerical modeling              
              of these dynamics, and a comprehensive satellite survey of                     
              mesoscale cyclogenesis over West Antarctica to define the                      
              contribution of synoptic forcing.                                              
                                                                                             
              The project should improve our understanding of antarctic climate              
              dynamics, particularly the interactions between the synoptic and               
              the mesoscale, and should identify whether these cyclones in                   
              conjunction with synoptic forcing contribute significantly to the              
              West Antarctic snowfall.
