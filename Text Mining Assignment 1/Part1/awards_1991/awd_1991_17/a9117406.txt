Abstract    :
                   The goals of this project are (1) To better constrain the                 
              viscosity and flow structure of the mantle through joint                       
              geoid/seismic data fitting, (2) develop a self-consistent inversion            
              scheme for the body wave (S and P), surface wave, and normal mode              
              data that includes in the seismic inversion process the effects due            
              to the boundary deformations induced by any internal density                   
              anomalies, and (3) explore the effects of phase transitions and                
              lateral (temperature-dependent) viscosity variations on internal               
              mantle structure and the geoid through 2-D and 3-D numerical                   
              experiments and seismic dataset intercomparisons.
