Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The long range goal of this research is to understand the                      
              regulation of juvenile hormone (JH) synthesis by the corpora allata            
              (CA) in insects. JH Controls metamorphosis in immature insect and              
              reproduction in adult insects. The emphasis here will be on the                
              molecular analysis of the neuropeptide, allatotropin (Mas AT), an              
              important stimulatory factor in the regulation of the reproduction             
              of JH in the tobacco horn worm. This research will enhance our                 
              understanding of insect reproduction.
