Abstract    :
                   This award will provide for one half the funds necessary to               
              acquire an isotope ratio mass spectrometer with small sample                   
              capabilities. The University of Texas at Austin has a commitment               
              to provide the additional funding needed for this acquisition. This            
              state of the art instrument will replace a 20 year old instrument,             
              and will be capable of analyzing very small samples. Small sample              
              capability is necessary to utilize an existing laser-based                     
              extraction system, and to utilize two laser-based systems under                
              construction. The PI and his students are expected to continue to              
              be leaders in the field of sedimentary geochemistry. This new                  
              instrument should help them to develop new techniques for small                
              sample analysis. Spot analysis of minerals will then be possible;              
              this can be crucially important to refine our understanding of the             
              chemistry of sedimentary materials.
