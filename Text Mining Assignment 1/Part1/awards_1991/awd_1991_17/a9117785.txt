Abstract    :
              Many bacteria are propelled by reversible rotary motors which                  
              derive the energy for rotation from a protonmotive gradient.  Among            
              the many proteins required to build a fully functional motor, there            
              are five, called MotA, MotB, FliG, FliM, and FliN, that are most               
              likely to be involved in torque generation.  FliG, FliM, and FliN              
              are also important for assembly and for determining the direction              
              of rotation; these are called "switch-complex" proteins.  The roles            
              of the switch-complex proteins in torque generation will be                    
              examined, using molecular genetics to make mutations in these                  
              components, and detailed measurements of motor performance to                  
              assess the consequences.  The effects of controlled, low-level                 
              expression of theses proteins also will be examined.  This strategy            
              is similar to that used previously to study MotA and MotB.  The                
              long-term objective of these studies is to understand, at the                  
              molecular level, how the flagellar motor converts chemical energy              
              into mechanical energy.  Understanding mechanisms of energy                    
              conversion is a central concern in bioenergetics.  Also since                  
              motility plays a role in certain bacterial infections,                         
              understanding the flagellar motor is likely to have clinical                   
              significance.
