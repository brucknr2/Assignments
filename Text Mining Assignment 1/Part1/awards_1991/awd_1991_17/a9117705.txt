Abstract    :
                This research will deal with determination of the 3-D seismic                
              velocity structure in the area of the Southern Great Basin                     
              Seismic Network, effectively covering southern Nevada.  The                    
              technique involves inversion of P and S seismic wave travel times              
              from local events and teleseisms.  Geologic mapping reveals that               
              the upper crustal extension has been quite heterogeneous, with                 
              highly extended terranes adjoining virtually unextended terranes.              
              How this extension is manifested in the middle and lower crust                 
              and upper mantle remains in dispute.  This analysis is expected                
              to resolve structural elements of about 10 km size down to                     
              approximately 300 km depth.  This analysis bears on the nature of              
              active normal faulting at depth in the Basin and Range province.               
              This research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard                 
              Reduction Program.
