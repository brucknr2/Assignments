Abstract    :
              Seasonal drifting pack ice covers vast regions of the Southern                 
              Ocean.  The biota in pack ice are found throughout the ice floes,              
              and this has been attributed to the harvesting and concentration               
              of organisms from the water during frazil ice formation.  The                  
              frequent formation of frazil ice and the concentration of                      
              organisms in newly-forming ice is one of the fundamental                       
              differences between the pack ice and the land fast ice habitats.               
              During the autumn to winter transitional light levels and                      
              atmospheric temperatures decrease and a considerable amount of                 
              seasonal sea ice forms.  Organisms incorporated into ice floes                 
              during this season will be subjected to low temperature, high in               
              situ salinities and low light.  This project will examine the                  
              process of the incorporation of organisms into ice to determine                
              if selection occurs, if organisms survive and if some organisms                
              form resting stages as a means for insuring overwinter survival.               
              This is part of an international, multidisciplinary study of the               
              pack ice system.  This project will be a key part of the                       
              collaboration, which focuses on biological, physical and chemical              
              processes during the autumn ice-forming season.
