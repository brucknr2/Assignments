Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Recent research has demonstrated that the nebulosity surrounding               
              the familiar Pleiades star cluster results from an accidental                  
              encounter between the cluster and an interstellar cloud.  Data from            
              the Infrared Astronomical Satellite have revealed the wake of the              
              Pleiades in the ambient interstellar medium, and have indicated the            
              existence of a bow shock where heated gas near the cluster                     
              compresses the upstream material.  Dr. White's research has the                
              following aims: to trace the motions of the interstellar gas                   
              observed toward the Pleiades, particularly in the cluster-cloud                
              interaction region; to explore the physical conditions that prevail            
              in the gas and infer the spatial relationships among the stars and             
              the nearby gas; to characterize interstellar processes in the                  
              cluster, particularly the dominant process of gas heating by                   
              photoelectrons emitted from dust grains and the poorly understood              
              formation process of the CH+ molecule.  The means to these ends                
              will be analysis of interstellar absorption lines in high                      
              resolution, high sensitivity spectra of cluster and background                 
              stars to be obtained at Kitt Peak National Observatory.  This award            
              is made under the Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI)                 
              program.
