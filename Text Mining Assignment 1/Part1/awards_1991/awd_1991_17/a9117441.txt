Abstract    :
              This award supports a project to utilize fission track analysis to             
              address the uplift and denudation history of the Transantarctic                
              Mountains in the Horlick and Thiel Mountains, and The Ellsworth                
              Mountains in West Antarctica.  Sampling strategy in each region                
              will vary according to relief, rock type, proximity to tectonic                
              features, and lateral extent of outcrop.  Samples will be returned             
              to the Fission Track Laboratory at Arizona State University and                
              processed for counting using the external detector method, as well             
              as track length measurements.
