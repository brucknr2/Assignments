Abstract    :
              This project is for final development of a new technique that                  
              directly measures volumetric changes of silicate liquids as a                  
              function of temperature and pressure.  This new technique will                 
              operate over a larger range in temperature and viscosity than is               
              currently accessible with existing volumetric techniques, and will             
              measure volume changes to at least an order of magnitude greater               
              precision.                                                                     
              Final development of this technique will include measurements of               
              materials whose thermal expansivities are well constrained, and                
              comparisons to existing data.  Having completed development of the             
              technique at 1 bar, several measurements will be made of the                   
              thermal expansivity of silicate liquids in the system                          
              CaO-Na2O-Al2O3-SiO2 from below Tg to 1600oC.  In addition, in situ             
              measurements of  V of crystallization of silicate liquids that                 
              crystallize readily at temperatures below their liquids will also              
              be explored.
