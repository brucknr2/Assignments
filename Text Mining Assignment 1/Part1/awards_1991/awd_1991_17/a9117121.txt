Abstract    :
                   Research conducted as part of this project will supply                    
              detailed information about the evolution of foreland basins.  In               
              foreland basins, sea level change, variations in thrust propagation            
              and changes in sediment supply influence depositional processes.               
              Collection of detailed field data coupled with numerical modeling              
              of the processes active during foreland basin evolution will help              
              constrain interpretations of hinterland and basin development.  Our            
              understanding of the interaction of tectonics, eustasy and                     
              sedimentation is currently limited for these complex environments.             
              The application of theoretical modeling to a detailed data set will            
              provide important information which can be used for future                     
              interpretation of stratal patterns in foreland basins.  Field data             
              for this study will be collected in the Upper Cretaceous Blackhawk             
              Formation, and will focus on the stratigraphic record of                       
              progradational and transgressive events.  The relatively short time            
              interval modeled (580,000 years) distinguishes this study from                 
              previous numerical modeling studies of foreland basins.
