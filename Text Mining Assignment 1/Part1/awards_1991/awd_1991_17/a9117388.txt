Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The goal of Dr. Spergel's project is to synthesize the growing body            
              of observational data that suggests that our Galaxy, the Milky Way,            
              has significant non-axisymmetric structure.  Improvements in                   
              infrared technology have enabled astronomers to observe the                    
              galactic center at wavelengths not obscured by dust.  These                    
              observations suggest that our Galaxy is barred.  Radio wavelength              
              surveys of gas motions in our Galaxy reveal significant non-                   
              circular motions that are likely due to this bar.  Dr. Spergel                 
              plans to develop analytical and numerical techniques to construct              
              a three-dimensional model of the Milky Way that is consistent with             
              the observations.  Improvements in our understanding of orbital                
              dynamics in triaxial systems as well as improvements in numerical              
              techniques and computer hardware will facilitate this study.  Dr.              
              Spergel also plans to study the dynamics of corrugation waves and              
              spiral density waves excited by the bar and the galactic spheroid              
              and to explore how these waves alter gas motions in the Galaxy.                
              Ultimately the goal of this research is to better understand the               
              morphology and dynamics of the Milky Way and to provide insight                
              into its origin and evolution.
