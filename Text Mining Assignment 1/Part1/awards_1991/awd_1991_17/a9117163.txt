Abstract    :
              The principal investigator will study the thermal evolution of                 
              aureoles associated with contact metamorphic zones, using                      
              petrologic and modelling tools. This will provide important clues              
              regarding the type(s) of heat transport operating around such                  
              bodies and will give geologists critical information needed to                 
              interpert the geologic histories of these zones.
