Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This no-cost award will support the participation of Professor                 
              Gerald Peterson, Department of Physics and Astronomy, University               
              of Massachusetts, in a U.S.-Japan cooperative research project with            
              Professor Tadaaki Tamae, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan.  This               
              project, which also involves other participants from the University            
              of Massachusetts and from Shizuoka University in Japan, will study             
              the bonding of the neutron to the proton by sending a steady beam              
              of high-energy electrons onto a container of deuterium cooled to               
              such a low temperature that the deuterium gas will turn to a liquid.           
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
              This is a no-cost proposal for NSF.  It is required because the                
              Japanese counterpart proposal to the Japan Society for the                     
              Promotion of Science (JSPS) requests funding for the Japanese                  
              investigators.
