Abstract    :
              The principal investigator, in collaboration with Dr. Melinda Dyar             
              of the University of Oregon, will study the crystal chemistry of               
              coexisting biotite, muscovite, and chlorite from several different             
              representative rock provenances. Electron microprobe, Mossbauer,               
              and other analytical techniques will be utilized. The work will                
              lead to a better understanding of the location of vacancies in the             
              structures of these minerals. It also will lead to a better                    
              understanding of the chemical substitutions that occur in the                  
              minerals and of the controls on the partitioning of ferric iron and            
              hydrogen among crystallographic sites in the minerals, as well as              
              between mineral pairs. These data will be of importance to                     
              geologists who use these minerals to estimate the geologic                     
              conditions of formation of rocks in which the minerals occur.
