Abstract    :
              Theoretical research will be conducted on two major areas of non-              
              equilibrium physics: growth far from equilibrium and the modeling              
              of chemical kinetics.  Work on growth far from equilibrium will                
              include studies of diffusion limited aggregation, reaction limited             
              aggregation, and modeling of molecular beam epitaxial growth.                  
              Studies of chemical reactions and catalysis will include reaction              
              limited heterocatalysis and fluctuation-dominated kinetics.

              Theoretical studies will be undertaken in the nonlinear science of             
              the growth of systems far from equilibrium, such as thin film                  
              growth, and of chemical kinetics related to reactions and                      
              catalysis.
