Abstract    :
              The goal of the proposed research is to design, analyze, and                   
              perform feasibility studies of key components of systems that                  
              support scientific modeling in data-intensive and numerically-                 
              intensive applications, particularly in the area of large-scale                
              environmental science. The two major sets of issues under                      
              investigation are explicit support for the complex spatio-                     
              temporal objects that are required in the computational modeling               
              of scientific phenomena (as well as their temporal and spatial                 
              relationships) and  transparent support for data access from                   
              large, heterogeneous and distributed data sources. As products of              
              this research, the following tools will be developed: languages                
              for the definition and manipulation of complex, spatio-temporal                
              objects and for the mathematical and statistical modeling of                   
              scientific phenomena; algorithms for the support of schema                     
              updates and evolution; optimization techniques for spatial and                 
              temporal manipulations; protocols for storage and operation                    
              abstraction; and platforms for collaborative scientific research.              
              The particular domain of scientific application involves database              
              support for investigating the hydrology of the Amazon basin,                   
              which is chosen as a typical Earth Observation System (EOS)                    
              project. The research, however, is designed to benefit many areas              
              of the natural sciences by providing a set of tools for                        
              increasing the productivity of scientists who need to integrate                
              complex modeling activities with the use of large datasets, which              
              is a problem encountered in most EOS projects.
