Abstract    :
              This project is an examination of the physical and structural                  
              properties of the antarctic ice pack in the Amundsen,                          
              Bellingshausen, and Ross Seas, with the goal of defining the                   
              geographical variability of various ice types, the deformation                 
              processes that are active in the antarctic ice pack, and the                   
              large-scale thermodynamics and heat exchange processes of the ice-             
              covered Southern Ocean.  An additional goal is to relate specific              
              characteristics of antarctic sea ice to its synthetic aperture                 
              radar (SAR) signature as observed from satellites.                             
                                                                                             
              Physical properties include the salinity, temperature, and brine               
              volumes, while structural properties include the fraction of                   
              frazil, platelet, and congelation ice of the seasonal antarctic                
              pack ice.  Differences in ice types are the result of differences              
              in the environment in which the ice forms: frazil ice is formed in             
              supercooled sea water, normally through wind or wave-induced                   
              turbulence, while platelet and congelation ice is formed under                 
              quiescent conditions.  The fraction of frazil ice (which has been              
              observed to be generally in excess of 50% in Weddell Sea ice floes)            
              is an important variable in the energy budget of the upper ocean,              
              and contributes significantly to the stabilization of the surface              
              layers.                                                                        
                                                                                             
              The integration of sea ice field observations and synthetic                    
              aperture radar data analysis and modeling studies will contribute              
              to a better understanding of sea ice parameters and their                      
              geophysical controls, and will be useful in defining the kind of               
              air-ice-ocean interactions that can be studied using SAR data, as              
              well as having broader relevance and application to atmospheric,               
              biological, and oceanographic investigations of the Southern                   
              Ocean.
