Abstract    :
                9117110  Badler    This is the third year of a three-year continuing grant. 
              The goal  of this research is 3-D animation of facial expressions including 
              those conveying emotion correlated with the intonation of the  voice.  This
              includes differentiation of timing, pitch and emphasis  that are related to
              semantic distinctions of discourse as "given"  and "new" information.  Until
              now, existing systems have not taken  into account the link between these two
              features.  The alogrithm to  be used will embody rules that control these
              various modes of  expression.  The choice of accents and their placement will
              be  examined in conjunction with whether the message is new or old.   The
              facial model integrates the action of each muscle or group of  muscles as well
              as the propagation of their movement.  A two-person  conversation model will
              also be investigated to explore the roles  of the listener and the speaker and
              how turn-taking is established  facially and by gestures.
