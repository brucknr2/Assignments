Abstract    :
              This grant supplies logistical and field support to make millimeter            
              wavelength radio measurements of the stratospheric gases, ozone,               
              nitrous oxide and, especially, chlorine monoxide.  The measurements            
              will be made from McMurdo, Antarctica.  The purpose is to provide              
              "ground truth" for the similar microwave emission spectrometer on              
              NASA's Upper Atmospheric Research Satellite (UARS).  The PI has                
              been making similar measurements from Antarctica to study the                  
              annual ozone hole phenomena for several of the past few years.                 
                                                                                             
              The necessary support funds for the PI are being supplied by NASA.
