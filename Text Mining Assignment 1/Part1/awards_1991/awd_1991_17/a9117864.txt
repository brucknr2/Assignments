Abstract    :
                   Sedimentary basins of the United States Midcontinent  contain             
              significant petroleum reservoirs and ore deposits of lead, zinc,               
              barite, and fluorite which appear to have origins related to the               
              migration of deep groundwater and hydrocarbons over 100's of                   
              kilometers.  Geological and geochemical data are abundant for these            
              sedimentary basins and so they are nearly perfect candidates for               
              constraining theoretical models for deep groundwater flow and                  
              petroleum migration over geological time and distances.  A new                 
              three-dimensional finite-element model will be constructed to                  
              quantify coupled deep groundwater flow and heat transport as a                 
              function of time.  This model will then be applied to studies of               
              two specific regional problems:  (1) Ore formation on the Ozark                
              Dome of southeast Missouri and (2) Oil migration in the Anadarko               
              Basin of Oklahoma and Kansas.  The effects of three-dimensional                
              flow and transport on ore formation a t the district-scale will                
              also be investigated with detailed models of the Viburnum Trend and            
              Old Lead Belt in southeast Missouri.  Geochemical theories for ore-            
              solution transport and deposition will be tested with reaction-path            
              calculations which are coupled to the groundwater flow system.  The            
              work represents the first effort in characterizing true three-                 
              dimensional effects of groundwater plaeoflow at the basin scale                
              and as such it ought to pioneer a new generation of ideas and                  
              applications in studies of the role of groundwater in geologic                 
              processes.
