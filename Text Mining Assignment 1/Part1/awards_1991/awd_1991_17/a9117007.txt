Abstract    :
              A six week summer program in mathematical physiology will be held              
              during the summer of 1992 at the Mathematical Sciences Research                
              Institute (MSRI) in Berkeley, California.  The primary focus of                
              the program is the application of mathematics to cellular                      
              neuroscience and integrative physiology.  The goals of the                     
              program are to further ongoing collaborative research between                  
              mathematicians and biologists, to demonstrate to the biology and               
              mathematics community the importance and the excitement of                     
              research in this field, and to bring new mathematicians into the               
              field by directly involving them in collaborations.  The program               
              is organized into 4 two week workshops and 4 one week workshops                
              organized primarily around biological topics.
