Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The oceanographic instrumentation program supports requests to                 
              acquire instrumentation for the collection, processing and analysis            
              of oceanographic data.  This proposal from Columbia University's               
              Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory (LDGO) requests funding for              
              acquisition of an Inductively-Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer                 
              (ICP/MS).  This instrument will be used to support NSF-funded                  
              research at LDGO and will be made available for shared use by the              
              oceanographic community.  LDGO will supply matching funds for this             
              purchase.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              The inductively-coupled plasma (ICP) interface effectively lowers              
              the detection limit for mass spectrometer analysis.  Samples are               
              aspirated into a high temperature argon plasma, which ionizes                  
              elements with ionization potentials lower than Ar with an                      
              efficiency of over 90% (for 50 elements; 70% for most others).                 
              These ions are then pulled through the ICP interface to the mass               
              spectrometer.  The instrument will be used for a wide variety of               
              NSF-funded research efforts that require the accurate detection of             
              elemental composition.  The ICP-MS analysis technique allows the               
              use of smaller sample volumes and decreases the amount of time                 
              required per sample for analysis.
