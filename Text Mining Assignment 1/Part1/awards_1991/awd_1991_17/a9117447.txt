Abstract    :
              This award is for support of a program to establish a long-term                
              monitoring network of accumulation stakes at the South Pole.  The              
              scientific objectives are to determine the long-term history of                
              the "undisturbed" net accumulation regime and to assess the                    
              "station effect" upon the spatial distribution and magnitude of                
              net accumulation at the South Pole.  Thirteen shallow (< 12m)                  
              cores will be collected to examine accumulation rate variability               
              since 1955.  The goal is to leave in place an optimally designed               
              array of poles, the measurement of which can be incorporated into              
              the routine scientific observation program at South Pole Station.
