Abstract    :
                   Future activities of man, such as the expanded use of high-               
              speed civil aircraft, can be expected to perturb the chemical and              
              physical conditions of the lower stratosphere.  The magnitudes of              
              the effects of localized emissions of nitrogen and sulfur oxides,              
              water vapor, particulate matter, and other substances on the                   
              natural trace gas life cycles and ozone depletion, especially in               
              the face of altered aerosol and cloud characteristics, are highly              
              uncertain at present.  The work proposed here will provide                     
              important new data on the origins and behavior of various aqueous              
              aerosol particles and their roles in the heterogeneous chemistry of            
              the region.                                                                    
                   Laboratory experimentation will be performed with individual              
              and swarms of aqueous particles levitated electrodynamically in an             
              environment specifically controlled to simulate conditions in the              
              lower stratosphere or upper troposphere.  The levitated particles,             
              as well as their growth and chemical reactions, will be                        
              interrogated by a variety of methods.  Raman scattering will help              
              determine the size, phase, and composition of the particles.  Mass             
              spectroscopy, and possibly resonance fluorescence and absorption               
              techniques, will be used to measure the changes in the                         
              concentrations of the trace reactant and product gases.  Other                 
              particle characteristics such as weight, fallspeed, and shape will             
              be measured by techniques already used in our laboratories.
