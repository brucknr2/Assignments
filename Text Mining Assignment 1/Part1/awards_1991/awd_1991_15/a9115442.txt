Abstract    :
              This collaborative project between Michael Milgroom, Cornell                   
              University, and Wang Kerong, Nanjing Agricultural University,                  
              Nanjing, China, will compare the genetic diversity and population              
              structure of the chestnut blight fungus and its virus-like                     
              double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) parasites in China and the US.  At                 
              least eight populations in China will be sampled, and using                    
              molecular genetic markers identified in previous studies, fungal               
              isolates from each population will be analyzed for genetic                     
              variability.  The extent of population subdivision will be                     
              determined, from which inferences can be made about gene flows                 
              among fungus populations.  Fungal isolates from China will be                  
              screened for dsRNAs in order to estimate prevalence in Chinese                 
              populations.                                                                   
                                                                                             
              The chestnut blight fungus was introduced into the US from China               
              at the turn of the century and devastated the previously abundant              
              chestnut forests in the eastern US.  Studying the fungus                       
              populations at their source in China is an opportunity to                      
              understand the basic factors that affect the population biology                
              of this species in a long-established, relatively stable                       
              population.  This study is also expected to be useful for the                  
              development of a biological control program of the fungus.
