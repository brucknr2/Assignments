Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              It is proposed to conduct a series of three-dimensional numerical              
              simulations of the baroclinic circulation in the Gulf of Maine                 
              during summertime. The effects of wind stress, freshwater runoff               
              and stratification on the circulation will be investigated, first              
              separately, then together.
