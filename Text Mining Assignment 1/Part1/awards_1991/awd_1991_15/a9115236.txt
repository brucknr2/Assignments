Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Dr. Sellgren will study the stellar kinematics and stellar                     
              populations in the central few parsecs of our Galaxy.  Her main                
              objective is to determine if a massive black hole is present.  Its             
              mass will depend on the difference between the total mass                      
              distribution and the stellar mass distribution inferred from the               
              light distribution.  Thus, Dr. Sellgren plans to not only derive               
              the total mass distribution from stellar kinematics, but also to               
              examine the effect of apparent changes in the stellar population               
              in the central parsec on the mass to light ratio.  Her study of                
              stellar kinematics will include an improved measure of the velocity            
              dispersion of many individual bright cool stars in the Galactic                
              Center; a careful theoretical analysis of previously observed                  
              stellar kinematics; and a comparison of the kinematics of Galactic             
              Center stars and stars in the galactic bulge.  To understand                   
              stellar populations in the central parsec of the Galaxy, Dr.                   
              Sellgren will observe the spatial variation of the strength of the             
              2.3 micron absorption feature of carbon monoxide in cool stars;                
              search for Brackett gamma absorption from hot stars, and if                    
              detected, use it for stellar kinematics; and search for water vapor            
              and neutral sodium absorption from cool dwarf stars.
