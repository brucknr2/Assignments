Abstract    :
                   Dr. William Porter is the Director of the Adirondack                      
              Ecological Center, which is administered by the State University               
              of New York.  The Center supports field research conducted by                  
              resident and visiting investigators in a variety of habitats,                  
              including lakes, streams, and the transition from eastern                      
              deciduous forests to boreal forests.  Dr. Porter proposes to                   
              acquire new climatic sensors and automated recording instruments               
              for the Center's meteorological station.                                       
                   This facility improvement will increase the precision and                 
              reliability of the weather data collected at the Center.  These                
              data are used in research projects that address diverse topics                 
              including wildlife management, effects of acid rain, and                       
              population dymanics.  The new instruments will confer significant              
              benefits on a variety of studies.
