Abstract    :
                   This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) involves                 
              preliminary study of the role of plants in weathering by a two-fold            
              approach; a field study on the island of Hawaii and on Mt. St.                 
              Helens, and laboratory analyses.  Hawaii offers a unique                       
              opportunity to study weathering because here there are:  (1) dated             
              basalts ranging back to more than 4000 years (2) a wide range of               
              plant life, from lichens and algae to well developed rainforest,               
              within small regions of constant bedrock lithology and constant                
              microclimate and (3) access to the expertise of biologists who are             
              presently studying plant ecology in the same area.  We plan to                 
              measure the thickness and mineralogical and chemical composition               
              of weathering rinds on young flows and to determine the chemical               
              composition relative rates of weathering in the presence and                   
              absence of specific biota.                                                     
                   Modeling of the geochemical carbon cycle and its effect on                
              atmospheric CO  over Phanerozoic time (Berner, 1990) has revealed              
              the importance of knowing more about how land plants affect                    
              chemical weathering.  This includes both the effect of plants on               
              the rate of uptake of CO  by silicate weathering and the feedback              
              response of plant-mediated weathering to changes in atmospheric                
              CO .
