Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Three of the four carbon chemistry properties in seawater will be              
              determined during the JGOFS time-series expeditions in the                     
              Central Equatorial Pacific Ocean, which have been scheduled for                
              March 1992 and November 1992, a total of 67 days at sea.                       
                                                                                             
              The total inorganic carbon concentration will be determined using              
              an automated coulometric system; the CO2 fugacity using an                     
              equilibrator/infra-red procedure; and the total alkalinity using               
              the potentiometric acid titration.  The total inorganic carbon                 
              and the total alkalinity will be measured at sea in discrete                   
              seawater samples collected throughout the water column at the                  
              time-series stations.  Furthermore, the measurement of these                   
              three parameters in surface seawater will provide the means to                 
              critically evaluate the consistency and reliability of each of                 
              these data sets.  The accuracy of both total CO2 and total                     
              alkalinity will be controlled by measuring reference solutions by              
              A. Dickson.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              The processed data will be (1) quality controlled according to                 
              the criteria that soon will be established by the DOE sponsored                
              committee responsible for CO2 data quality management, (2)                     
              tabulated and added to the JGOFS data base for distribution to                 
              the scientific community, and (3) used in conjunction with                     
              associated measurements both to give a descriptive account of the              
              results and to quantify the processes involved in the                          
              spatiotemporal variations of the properties of the oceanic carbon              
              cycle.
