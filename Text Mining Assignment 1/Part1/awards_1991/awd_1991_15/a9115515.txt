Abstract    :
              The main goal of this project is                                               
              the development of a novel solid                                               
              substrate fermentation process for                                             
              the bioconversion of agricultural                                              
              residues into animal feed.  The                                                
              novel technology consists of the                                               
              sequential application of aerobic                                              
              fungal fermentation and anaerobic                                              
              lactic acid fermentation or                                                    
              ensiling.  The fungal fermentation                                             
              by a mixed culture of host fungi                                               
              will produce an enzyme complex well                                            
              adapted for partially degrading the                                            
              host plant cell wall into                                                      
              fermentable sugars, which in turn                                              
              will be used by the lactic acid                                                
              bacteria for efficient ensiling.                                               
              During ensiling, the lactic acid                                               
              preserves the substrate and                                                    
              catalyzes the hydrolysis of                                                    
              lignocellulose by the fungal                                                   
              enzymes obtained in the aerobic                                                
              phase.                                                                         
                                                                                             
              This project will concentrate on                                               
              elucidating the microbiological and                                            
              enzymatic interactions in this                                                 
              mixed culture fermentation process,                                            
              which may be an appropriate

              utilization of agricultural, range,                                            
              and forestry residues, and which                                               
              may also contribute to the
