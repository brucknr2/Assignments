Abstract    :
                   This infrastructure award is for the development of a                     
              visualization and machine learning laboratory.  The laboratory                 
              consists of powerful graphics workstations, a parallel processor,              
              a large file server, a fiber optics high speed data network,                   
              and support personnel to maintain the laboratory.  The research                
              supported by this equipment includes:  statistical data analysis,              
              pattern recognition, and machine learning; visualization of                    
              sample volume data; interactive steering of simulations; high                  
              speed switching;concurrent systems; and applications of                        
              electronic libraries.                                                          
                                                                                             
                   A major bottleneck to the utilization of scientific                       
              information is the massive amount of data now collected.                       
              Scientific visualization is the term that covers an emerging                   
              collection of new techniques for transforming multidimensional                 
              numeric data into understandable graphic images.  These images                 
              can then be manipulated and explored by scientists and engineers               
              who, sitting at their workstations, create models and draw                     
              inferences from them. Machine learning includes a wide variety of              
              techniques from the fields of pattern recognition, signal                      
              processing, statistical decision and control theory, and                       
              artificial intelligence that allow the machine itself to                       
              participate in the process of creating models and drawing                      
              inferences from data.  It is anticipated that a new synergy                    
              between machine learning and scientific visualization will arise               
              from this award and that substantial collaborations with                       
              scientists outside of the computer science department will occur.
