Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal is a request for travel and registration                         
              assistance for participants from universities and non-profit                   
              research institutions.  Travel and conferences registration                    
              expenses have been estimated ranging from $850 to $2400.  The                  
              primary aim of this conference on organic thin films is to                     
              allow scientists and engineers from industry, universities,                    
              and government to present their most recent research findings,                 
              and exchange ideas.  Organic thin films is a broad field,                      
              including such diverse areas as cell membranes, structural                     
              variability of organic molecules, and molecular assembly                       
              methods such self-assembly and Langmuir-Blodgett films.
