Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Dr. Reynolds will continue his investigation into the nature and               
              origin of warm ionized gas in the interstellar medium.  This gas               
              is a major, newly identified component of the medium about which               
              very little is known.  An accurate understanding of interstellar               
              matter and processes is going to require as thorough an                        
              investigation of this ionized component as of the other principal              
              components of the medium.  The work will concentrate on                        
              observations of the structure and kinematics of the ionized                    
              regions, the relationship between the regions of ionized gas and               
              regions of neutral hydrogen at high Galactic latitude, and the                 
              ionization conditions within the gas.  The observations will be                
              carried out with the large aperture Fabry-Perot spectrometer at the            
              University of Wisconsin, which has made possible the detection and             
              study of the faint optical line emission from this gas, and which              
              as a result has become the primary source of information about the             
              properties of this last major component of the interstellar medium.            
              Developments in the instrumentation will provide significant                   
              improvements in the observational capabilities and will help to                
              open up further this new area of interstellar medium astronomy.
