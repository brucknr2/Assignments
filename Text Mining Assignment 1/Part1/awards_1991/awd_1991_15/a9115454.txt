Abstract    :
              This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic                  
              Program is made to Dr. Jack Halpern of the Chemistry                           
              Department, University of Chicago, for studies in the general                  
              area of kinetics and mechanisms of reactions for organometallic                
              compounds.  Five areas of investigation will be pursued:                       
              asymmetric catalytic hydrogenation reactions; dissociation                     
              energies of transition metal-alkyl bonds; catalytic properties                 
              of transition metal polyhydrides; alkyl transfer and                           
              iron-carbon bond dissociation energies for alkyl iron porphyrin                
              compounds; and oxidative addition reactions of Rh and Ir                       
              metalloporphyrins.  The asymmetric hydrogenation of acrylic                    
              acid derivatives and transfer hydrogenation reactions will be                  
              investigated.  Studies on the polyhydrides will include                        
              reactions involving hydrogen transfer, hydrogenation, and                      
              reductive elimination.                                                         
              %%%                                                                            
              Some catalysts, like enzymes, promote reactions in which not                   
              only a certain arrangement of atoms is achieved, but only one                  
              of two possible three-dimensional arrangements.  Understanding                 
              the mechanism of such "asymmetric catalysis" reactions is                      
              important in order to be able to develop new catalysts which                   
              can behave with this specificity in a variety of reactions.                    
              Asymmetric catalysts promise to find broad use in organic                      
              synthesis, biological modeling studies, and the pharmaceutical                 
              industry.  Iron porphyrin studies may have relevance to                        
              reactions of iron-containing enzymes.
