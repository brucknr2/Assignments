Abstract    :
              The spectral absorption lines of hot, rapidly rotating "B" type                
              stars show traveling "bumps" which travel across the lines with                
              time.  Although these bumps were first thought to move periodically            
              in a predictable way, leading to an interpretation that traveling              
              waves (nonradial pulsations) were responsible, new data indicate               
              that the bumps are often missing.  In order to judge whether this              
              apparent unpredictability is caused by the "beating" of different              
              pulsation modes or by an aperiodic phenomenon, long strings of                 
              spectroscopic data are needed.  In the past long "campaigns" have              
              been difficult to undertake because of practical scheduling and                
              allocation problems at national facilities.  In early 1992 Georgia             
              State will put into operation its new spectroscopic "Multi-                    
              Telescope Telescope. This facility will have a large effective                 
              light gathering power and a Charged-Couple Device detector and                 
              will permit the PI to obtain large amounts of data to examine                  
              the frequency of the "profile bump" phenomenon in rapidly rotating             
              B stars and to ascertain its periodic nature.  The PI also believes            
              that the large database assembled will enable him to determine                 
              whether nonradial pulsations are responsible for episodic mass loss            
              in the enigmatic group of rapidly rotating "Be" stars.
