Abstract    :
              This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic                  
              Program supports research by Dr. Daniel L. Reger of the                        
              Chemistry Department, University of South Carolina at Columbia,                
              on coordination compounds of post-transition metals,                           
              specifically, Sn, Pb, Ga, In, and Tl.  Compounds will contain                  
              bidentate and tripod-tridentate poly(pyrazolyl)borate ligands,                 
              which have previously exhibited a variety of coordination                      
              numbers depending on the size of the metal.  By modification of                
              the pyrazolyl ring, steric control of the extent of                            
              oligomerization will be attempted.  In addition, hydride,                      
              alkoxide and amide derivatives will be synthesized and thermal                 
              decomposition of new alkyl metal complexes will be studied.                    
              The solution structure of the previously-prepared tin complexes                
              will be investigated using NMR methods.  Some work on compounds                
              containing related polyphosphinoylmethanide ligands is also                    
              planned.                                                                       
              %%%                                                                            
              The ability of the later elements of Groups 13 and Group 14,                   
              namely tin, lead, gallium, indium and thallium, to form                        
              coordination compounds has not been studied extensively. The                   
              new coordination compounds which will be prepared in this                      
              project may be useful for preparation of semiconductors and                    
              optoelectronic devices by chemical vapor deposition.                           
              Water-soluble gallium and indium complexes might find utility                  
              in radiolabeling studies.
