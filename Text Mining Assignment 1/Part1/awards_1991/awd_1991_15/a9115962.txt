Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                  This project involves paleomagnetic and rock magnetic studies             
              in support of research drilling of the moat deposits of the Creede             
              caldera.  These studies will provide information relevant to the               
              dating and correlation of cores from the moat as well as                       
              information about the diagenetic conditions which affected the                 
              sediments and volcanic rocks after deposition in the moat.  The                
              project represent a collaboration between Kenneth L. Verosub of the            
              University of California, Davis, and Richard Reynolds and Joseph               
              Rosenbaum of the United State Geological Survey, Denver.
