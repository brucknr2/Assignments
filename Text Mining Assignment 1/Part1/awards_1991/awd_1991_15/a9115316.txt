Abstract    :
              The research is aimed to delineate the effect of relative motions              
              at interface on dynamic response of structures and foundations.                
              It will provide a new and improved understanding of the mechanism              
              of load transfer in dynamic soil-structure interaction as                      
              affected by roughness and fluid pressures. It is anticipated the               
              outcome will lead to improved designs of a wide range of                       
              geotechnical problems. A new test box will be developed to                     
              simulate behavior of saturated sand-concrete interfaces. A                     
              comprehensive series of laboratory tests will be performed and                 
              used for the development of a constitutive model based on the                  
              disturbed state concept and hierarchical plasticity models.
