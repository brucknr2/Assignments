Abstract    :
              Novae, dwarf novae, novae-like stars are all thought to be pairs               
              of stars in which a "main sequence" star is slowly expanding and               
              transferring some of its matter onto an orbiting "white dwarf."                
              The heating of fresh hydrogen from the first star results in                   
              thermonuclear reactions on the white dwarf's surface, leading                  
              to a vast class of rapid brightenings we observe as nova-type                  
              stars.  Many astronomers are trying to understand whether each of              
              these systems is the same type of object in a different stage of               
              evolution or whether they are fundamentally different types of                 
              objects.  In this two-year study the Principal Investigator (PI)               
              and a student will monitor a dozen binary stars that have under-               
              gone nova eruptions in the past to examine the periods and other               
              orbital characteristics that would lead to improved estimates                  
              of these stars' masses and radii.  This is expected to double                  
              the number of stars for which these fundamental parameters are                 
              known and to permit a better estimate to be made of the                        
              distribution of their periods.  The PI anticipates that this                   
              study will contribute to resolving whether nova undergo rapid                  
              mass transfer events followed by little exchanges between the                  
              two stars over longer times.  A resolution of this issue will                  
              help determine whether novae, dwarf novae, and nova-like systems               
              are the same system merely observed in different stages of                     
              evolution.  This is an award under the auspices of the NSF's                   
              Research for Undergraduate Institutions program and is expected                
              to contribute to the scientific instruction of graduate and                    
              undergraduate students at the PI's institution.
