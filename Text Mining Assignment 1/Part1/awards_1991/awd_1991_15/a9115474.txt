Abstract    :
              Equilibria, kinetics, and optical and infrared photochemistry                  
              of ions in the gas-phase will be explored. The studies will be                 
              accomplished primarily with ion cyclotron resonance (ICR)                      
              spectroscopy combined with conventional and laser light                        
              sources. An underlying theme of this study will be to develop                  
              an understanding of the intrinsic chemistry of highly reactive                 
              ions in relationship to their structure when they are removed                  
              from the stabilizing forces of solvent or crystals. Reactions                  
              that will be studied in the gas-phase are the SN2 reaction,                    
              acyl transfer reactions, reactions at unsaturated carbon,                      
              proton transfer processes, electron transfer reactions, energy                 
              transfer processes, and reactions of complex ions.

              This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the                      
              continuing research of Professor John I. Brauman at Stanford                   
              University. Most of the current knowledge of reactions                         
              involving ions (charged species ) is in solution where the                     
              solvent greatly influences the reactions and properties of                     
              ions. Professor Brauman will continue his studies of the                       
              reactions of ions in the gas-phase, where the stabilizing                      
              effect of the solvent is no longer present. Under the                          
              conditions afforded by the gas-phase, the intrinsic chemistry                  
              of highly reactive ions will be studied in relationship to                     
              their structure.
