Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project examines the hypothesis that recruitment pulses to                
              rocky intertidal barnacle populations are caused by the collision              
              of upwelling fronts with the rocky intertidal zone.  A front                   
              separates the relatively cold and salty upwelled water nearshore               
              from the relatively warm and fresh water further offshore.  It is              
              hypothesized that the upwelling front is a place of convergence,               
              and that larvae of intertidal barnacles accumulate there.  At                  
              certain times such fronts appear to collide with the shore and to              
              deposit their accumulated larvae on the rocky intertidal zone,                 
              thereby producing a recruitment peak.                                          
                                                                                             
              To test this hypothesis, knowledge of the temporal history of the              
              position and vertical structure of an upwelling front is required,             
              contemporaneously with knowledge of the distribution and abundance             
              of larvae in the water column and their recruitment success.  This             
              will be achieved through use of satellite AVHRR data, shipboard net            
              tows and temperature, salinity, and velocity measurements, moored              
              and shore-based measurements of temperature and wind, and benthic              
              monitoring in the intertidal zone.                                             
                                                                                             
              This research is significant in increasing our understanding of                
              recruitment and of cross-shelf transport, and in developing                    
              predictive models for the dynamics of coastal populations with                 
              pelagic larvae.
