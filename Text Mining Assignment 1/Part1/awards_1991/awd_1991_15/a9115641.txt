Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                                                                                            
              Preliminary results obtained from a north-south transect in the                
              equatorial Pacific suggest that the &15N in the surficial                      
              sediments of this region is strongly affected by the nitrate                   
              concentration in the overlying euphotic zone.  Similarly, carbon               
              isotopic composition of phytoplankton reflects ambient ?CO2(aq)!               
              and evidence exists that &13C in sedimentary organic matter is a               
              measure for this parameter in the equatorial Pacific.  This                    
              raises the possibility that &15N and &13C of sedimentary organic               
              matter might respectively record past nitrate and ?CO2(aq)!                    
              distributions in surface waters.  There is evidence for glacial                
              to interglacial changes in both the magnitude and latitudinal                  
              distribution of production in the equatorial Pacific that might                
              have influenced the global carbon cycle.  Sedimentary isotopic                 
              composition (&15N and &13C - both bulk and fractions thereof)                  
              will be used for the reconstruction of past changes in the                     
              distribution of nitrate and CO2(aq) in equatorial Pacific                      
              surface waters over the last 160 kyrs, as a means both to confirm              
              and to delineate the mechanisms for these past changes in                      
              productivity.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              Studies will be made of water column and early diagenetic                      
              processes which control the isotopic composition of buried                     
              organic matter.  Also sediment analyses will be used to                        
              reconstruct paleoceanographic nutrient and CO2(aq) distributions               
              in surface waters.
