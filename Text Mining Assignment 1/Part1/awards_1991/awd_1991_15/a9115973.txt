Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Determinants of human physical development have long been a                    
              central question of physical anthropology.  This dissertation                  
              improvement proposal intends to assess the use of bilateral                    
              asymmetries as a measure of pre-natal stress.  In order to                     
              investigate the relationship of stress to asymmetry, the student               
              will study cohorts of full-term infants of appropriate for age                 
              weights and compare the level of asymmetry exhibited in that                   
              group with the level seen in full-term growth retarded newborns.               
              Additionally, the parents of all infants will be measured for the              
              same suite of bilateral traits.  This will allow estimation of                 
              genetic versus environment effects.  The researchers hypothesize               
              that the normal weight infants will exhibit less bilateral                     
              asymmetry.  Additional, all newborns will be followed over one                 
              year and measured at defined intervals.  This will allow                       
              estimates of longitudinal changes in bilateral symmetry, a poorly              
              documented aspect of human biological variability.
