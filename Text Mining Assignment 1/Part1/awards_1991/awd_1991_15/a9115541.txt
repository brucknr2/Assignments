Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research program explores the combined effects of composition             
              and strain on atomic-resolution transmission electron microscopy               
              images and mechanisms of crystallization in amorphous alloys.                  
              Unique approaches include the atomic modeling of small crystallites            
              imbedded in an amorphous matrix and computer simulations of atomic             
              resolution microscopy images.  The computer simulations are                    
              extended to include planar and volume defects.  Quantitative                   
              analysis is directed towards the study of the dependence of image              
              contrast on strain.  In addition image contrasts in                            
              crystalline/amorphous phase results are explored.
