Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research project will address a number of issues about                    
              the determinants and supply of U.S. scientists and engineers.                  
              It will accomplish this by using the sixth round (1986) of the                 
              National Longitudinal Study of the High School and Beyond                      
              (HSB) survey for recent graduates; and it will use the                         
              Consortium of Financing Higher Education (COFHE) data set for                  
              college graduates.  They will investigate how labor market                     
              conditions affect enrollments in higher education, how                         
              financing arrangements for education affect a sequence of                      
              choices, how the quality of science and engineering education                  
              affect career choices, how these effects differ for women and                  
              minorities, and how effects vary with ability of individuals.//
