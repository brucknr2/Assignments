Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award provides support for the continued operation and                    
              improvement of the Haystack Radio Observatory, for many years one              
              of the foremost university operated observatories.  The                        
              completion of the upgrade to the telescope surface will provide                
              the most sensitive instrument in the U.S. at 3 mm wavelength.                  
              Studies then possible will contribute to many areas of astronomy,              
              including increasing our understanding of star-forming regions,                
              the interstellar medium, and star formation in other galaxies.
