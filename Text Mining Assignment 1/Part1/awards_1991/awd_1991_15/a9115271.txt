Abstract    :
                   The principal investigators will establish a manufacturing                
              research, development and implementation organization to perform               
              basic research, advanced development and pilot scale implementation            
              of new materials processing technology in cooperation with and with            
              the support of United States industry.  The work includes the                  
              establishment of a multi-investigator organization which is                    
              supported jointly by government and industry.                                  
                   The initial focus of the research will be on materials and                
              manufacturing process innovations for rapid response manufacturing             
              with enhanced performance and reduced cost.  Specific activities               
              will include the development of implementable manufacturing                    
              technologies in the areas of adaptive sheet metal forming, three-              
              dimensional printing, high rate material removal via three-                    
              dimensional laser machining, microcellular plastics processing and             
              metal matrix composites processing.
