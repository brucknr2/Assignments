Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The project explores the feasibility of using hollow fiber                     
              glass membranes for waste reduction through process                            
              improvement.  One application is separation of H2S and H2 at                   
              high stream temperatures (400 - 600F), to provide a more                      
              concentrated H2S - stream as a byproduct and to make the                       
              process more energy efficient.  A second application is the                    
              separation of NH3 from H2S in a sour water treatment process.                  
              By allowing the separation to take place at a higher                           
              temperature, the process for sulfur recovery will be important                 
              because of the removal of NH3.  Furthermore, the recovery of                   
              NH3 in high purity through the novel membrane separation                       
              process would reduce both pollution and the process costs.                     
              The project involves measurements of membranes selectivity and                 
              evaluation of process parameters.  The project is an SGER                      
              grant in the emerging NSF program on studies of                                
              Environmentally Benign Manufacturing.  This NSF program is a                   
              forerunner to a planned NSF-CCR (Council of Chemical Research)                 
              joint venture.
