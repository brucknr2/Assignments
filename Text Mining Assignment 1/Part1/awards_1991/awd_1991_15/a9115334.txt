              This award supports a continuation of the collaboration between                
              the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) and                 
              Jackson State University.  These institutions are developing                   
              scientific visualization tool sets specifically in the IBM Pc MS-              
              DOS environment.  These tools fill pressing needs in the area of               
              scientific visualization and advance the state of the art tools                
              available to many users.  All software, source code and                        
              documentation will be available for dissemination and widespread
