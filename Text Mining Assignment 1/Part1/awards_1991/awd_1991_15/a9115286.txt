Abstract    :
              With support from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and                              
              Organometallic Chemistry Program, Dr. David N. Hendrickson of                  
              the University of California, San Diego will undertake an                      
              investigation of electronically labile transition metal                        
              complexes.  These include systems that exhibit spin crossover                  
              (between two spin states centered on the metal), valence                       
              tautomerism (transfer between the metal and a coordinated                      
              ligand), and intervalence transfer in binuclear complexes                      
              (transfer between two metal centers that have different                        
              oxidation states).  These studies will employ a broad range of                 
              Techniques for physical inorganic studies as well as molecular                 
              mechanics calculations of substituent and lattice solvent                      
              motions to aid in the determination of the factors affecting                   
              the rate of electron hopping and the lifetimes of excited                      
              states.  Such electronically labile systems could provide the                  
              basis for optical switches, information storage devices, and                   
              other electronic components.                                                   
              %%%                                                                            
              Electron movement between orbitals (states) in a variety of                    
              solid state, transition metal compounds will be investigated.                  
              The goal of these studies is to understand the structural                      
              factors that govern the rates of electron movement between                     
              states and the lifetimes of higher energy (excited) states.                    
              Such an understanding is critical to technological applications                
              of such transition metal compounds for optical switches,                       
              information storage devices, and other electronic components.
