Abstract    :
              This grant will allow the American Society for Engineering                     
              Education (ASEE) to conduct a two-day workshop to provide a forum              
              for discussion and assessment of engineering education in the                  
              United States and in the USSR.  The workshop will address several              
              issues, among which are: degree requirements in each country;                  
              prospects and requirements for establishing equivalency between                
              degrees awarded in each country; prospects for awarding dual                   
              accreditation to programs in each country; tactics for developing              
              areas of joint research interest; and establishing common                      
              nomenclature to facilitate achievement of other goals.
