Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              An experimental investigation is to be carried out of the                      
              removal of contaminants from a surface by a flowing liquid.                    
              State-of-the-art chemical detection diagnostics will be used                   
                                                                                             
              to determine the removal of contaminants from the wall of a                    
              tube by flow in the tube. Parameters to be varied in a                         
              controlled manner are contaminants, flow conditions, and fluid                 
                                                                                             
              properties.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              The research will provide needed information on                                
              decontamination parameters, and impact current practices in                    
              the waste disposal and waste treatment area.
