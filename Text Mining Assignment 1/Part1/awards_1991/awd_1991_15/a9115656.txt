Abstract    :
              In this project in Experimental Physical Chemistry, Chemistry                  
              Division, Felker will use rotational coherence spectroscopy to                 
              obtain geometric structures of large species in supersonic                     
              molecular beams. This includes studies of aromatic-aromatic                    
              dimers and higher clusters, and investigations of how                          
              hydrogen-bonded networks evolve with cluster size.

              By exposing molecules in the gas phase to short, sharp pulses                  
              of laser light at the proper frequency, Prof. Felker (UCLA)                    
              will obtain information about geometric structures of a small,                 
              controlled number of interacting molecules. This information is                
              very useful for understanding how molecules behave in the                      
              initial stages of a wide variety of chemical reactions.
