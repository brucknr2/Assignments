Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The goal of these researchers is to study solar photon sputtering              
              of molecular water ices from the vacuum ultraviolet through the                
              extreme ultraviolet wavelength region in the laboratory.  The                  
              temperatures for the ices will be chosen to simulate realistic                 
              planetary conditions.                                                          
                                                                                             
              Sputtering of atoms and molecules from surfaces of astronomical                
              materials is an important process for mass transfer and evolution              
              in a number of astronomical environments, such as comets,                      
              asteroids, icy planets, satellites, rings, and interstellar dust               
              grains.  The excitation sources for sputtering are solar photons,              
              solar  wind,  magnetospheric particles, and micrometeorites.                   
              Experiments on sputtering by energetic ions have been carried out              
              in several laboratories.  However, this is not the case for solar              
              photon sputtering.  Current theories and model calculations assume             
              that the solar photon energies are directly converted into heat                
              which controls the vaporization of the astronomical material.  Mass            
              loss due to sputtering has not been included since the required                
              data are not available.  The experiments performed by Drs. Wu and              
              Judge should supply those data.
