Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              This study will:  (1) complete analysis of seasonally collected                
              samples and piston cores, designed to document physical,                       
              biological, and chemical factors controlling diagenetic reaction               
              dominance and rates of reactions in shelf facies, (2) utilize C1               
              and freon profiles to quantify diagenetic transport mechanisms and             
              mean salinity boundary conditions, (3) exploit the extensive zones             
              of Fe-mineral formation and transformation; (4) determine, in                  
              conjunction with water column studies, the influence of extensive              
              reduction of Fe-rich lateritic debris in shelf bottom sediments on             
              the transport of minor solutes (e.g. U, Se, As) to the interior                
              ocean; (5) document the geochemical and associated benthic                     
              biological indicators of these environments likely to be recorded              
              in the rock record; and (6) examine and evaluate possible                      
              similarities between the Amazon shelf and ancient environments of              
              iron mineral deposition.  Multidisciplinary integration will be                
              emphasized.
