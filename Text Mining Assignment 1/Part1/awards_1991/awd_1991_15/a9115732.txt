Abstract    :
              A special one and a half day workshop will be held, to identify                
              areas of academic research that can significantly impact the                   
              future of industrial technology development in the field of                    
              materials processing. About 30 leaders, in the area of materials               
              processing, will be invited to the workshop. They will include                 
              representatives from the academia, industry and the venture                    
              capital community and be required to establish a set of industry-              
              based priorities for materials processing research. The workshop,              
              at its conclusion, will submit a final report which will make                  
              specific recommendations on those technical challenges in                      
              materials processing and manufacturing to which resources can be               
              allocated with the highest impact.                                             
                                                                                             
              The identification of such opportunities will enable efforts and               
              resources to be effectively applied in the area of materials                   
              processing. This will help in slowing and even reversing the                   
              gradual erosion of the United States' international                            
              competitiveness in this field.
