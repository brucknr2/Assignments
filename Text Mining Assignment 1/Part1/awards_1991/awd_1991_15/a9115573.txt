Abstract    :
              With support from the Experimental Physical Chemistry and                      
              Biochemistry and Molecular Structure Programs, Professor Record                
              will use Nuclear Magnetic Resonance to measure ion                             
              concentrations in intact, living cells subject to osmotic                      
              stress. Statistical mechanical theories will be used to                        
              interpret these data and obtain a molecular level model for the                
              role of thermodynamic nonideality in functional cell processes.                
              %%%                                                                            
              Professor Record will use modern, non-invasive spectroscopic                   
              techniques to monitor concentrations of important ions in                      
              intact, living cells. He will use thermodynamic theories with                  
              these data to develop a general understanding of the role of                   
              concentrated solutions in determining how cells function. This                 
              is a beautiful example of how to apply theoretical and                         
              experimental physical chemistry to important, complicated                      
              systems.
