Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A Sr-Isotopic stratigraphy will be developed for the middle                    
              Cretaceous (Barremian to Turonian) interval that is coincident with            
              the long magnetic quiet zone.  Seven continuous DSDP/ODP sections              
              from major basins will be used that have well worked out                       
              biostratigraphies and good foraminiferal preservation.  Effects of             
              digenesis of Sr isotopes will also be investigated.  The results               
              will help understand the mid Cretaceous paleoceanography.
