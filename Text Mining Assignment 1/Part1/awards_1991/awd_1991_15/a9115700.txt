Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research in             
              organometallic chemistry between J.W. Faller of Yale University                
              and J.A. Osborn of the University Louis Pasteur in Strasbourg,                 
              France.  The objective of their research is to develop novel,                  
              efficient asymmetric catalysts for controlling the stereochemistry of          
              doubled-bonded molecules containing both a heteroatom and carbon               
              atom.   Specifically they will investigate catalysts for the                   
              hydrogenation of ketones (acetones) and imines, which are                      
              ammonia compounds.  Dr. Faller brings to this collaboration                    
              extensive expertise with the design of stochiometric reagents for              
              organic synthesis.  This is complemented by the French group's                 
              experience with hydrogenation catalysts.                                       
                                                                                             
              Asymmetric catalysis and catalysts are used to control the                     
              stereochemistry of compounds.  These catalysts and their reagents              
              play an essential role in the design of non-toxic drugs and                    
              pharmaceuticals.  This research will advance our understanding of              
              the catalytical processes and result in the development of new and             
              more efficient catalytic reagents.
