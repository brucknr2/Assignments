Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program                 
              will help the Department of Chemistry at Rochester Institute of                
              Technology upgrade the existing NMR facility.  Among the areas                 
              of chemical research that will be enhanced by the acquisition                  
              are the following:                                                             
                                                                                             
              1.  Diffusion in the Water-Gelatin Matrix                                      
              2.  Structural Characterization of                                             
                   Bis(quadridentate)zirconium(IV) Complexes                                 
              3.  Additions of Arenesulfenyl Halides to Cyclopropanes                        
              4.  Antiviral Research                                                         
              5.  Synthesis of Substituted Imidazolinones from Chiral Amino                  
                   Acids                                                                     
                                                                                             
              Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy is the most                      
              powerful tool available to the chemist for the elucidation of                  
              the structure of molecules.  It is used to identify unknown                    
              substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within                 
              molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between                   
              molecules in solution.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR                         
              spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out                     
              frontier research.  The results from these NMR studies are                     
              useful in areas such as polymers and catalysis, and in biology.
