Abstract    :
                   Recently, impressions of what may be soft-bodied animals have             
              been discovered in USNM collections from the Belt Supergroup in                
              Glacier National Park.  Existing material is too scanty and poorly             
              preserved to convincingly document that the markings are of                    
              metazoan origin.  Exploratory field work will be conducted in the              
              area from which the museum collections were made, in hopes of                  
              finding more definitive specimens of these possible metazoans.                 
                   If the specimens do indeed represent metazoans, the age of                
              the oldest known animals would be extended from about 700 to 1400              
              million years.
