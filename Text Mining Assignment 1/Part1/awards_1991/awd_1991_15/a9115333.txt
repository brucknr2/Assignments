Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project supports a workshop on parallel processing and                    
              vectorization at the Cornell National Supercomputing Facility                  
              (CNSF).  Eight Historically Black Colleges and Universities                    
              (HBCU's) will send two engineering faculty from each institution               
              to the workshop.  The CNSF supercomputer center will work closely              
              with these institutions to encourage them to expand the scope of               
              their research programs by utilizing the advanced computational                
              capabilities of the center.  The participants will have an                     
              opportunity to meet and form the basis of future collaborations                
              with other researchers.  Each participant will receive an                      
              allocation of time on the CNSF supercomputer.
