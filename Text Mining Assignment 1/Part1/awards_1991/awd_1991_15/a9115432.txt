Abstract    :
              Hachtel         This a joint project with Colorado, (G. Hachtel, M. Lightner 
              and F. Somenzi), UC, Berkeley (R.K. Brayton, A.R. Newton and A. 
              Sangiovanni-Vincentelli), and Stanford (G. De Micheli).  The  research is a
              systematic approach to synthesis and verification  of logic at all levels,
              combinational, sequential and behavioral,  from HDL specifications.  Objectives
              are:  1.     Performance oriented synthesis through realistic modeling  and
              delay/area tradeoff optimization;  2.     Maximization of testability; and  3. 
                 Exploiting partitioning to solve both chip and multi-chip  module design
              problems.  The model is of sequential circuits based on a network of 
              interacting, possibly non-deterministic, finite state machines  (FSMs), in
              which interconnections can have unbounded delay  attributes.  In this model,
              the component machines may have  symbolic or encoded I/O and can degenerate to
              just combinational  logic or just latches.  This enables uniform treatment of 
              disparate objects such as RAMs, controllers, ALUs, pipeline  registers, etc.   
                   Research topics are:  1.     algorithms and theory for logic manipulation
              to support a  variety of applications;  2.     design, synthesis, and formal
              approaches based on the theory  and algorithms;  3.     design of embedded
              controllers, including hardware-software  co-design; and  4.     application of
              logic techniques to "non-standard" areas such  as machine learning, theorem
              proving and combinatorics.         A set of coordinated synthesis tools is
              being produced.  The  tools operate at both high level or low level depending
              on  whether they operate above or below the FSM model.
