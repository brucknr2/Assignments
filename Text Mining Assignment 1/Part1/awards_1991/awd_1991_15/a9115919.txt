Abstract    :
                   This Research Opportunity Award funds a primarily Hispanic                
              institution, the City College of the City University of New York,              
              to collaborate with Rutgers University Cooperative Research Center             
              for Ceramics.  The two year collaborative project is "Pyrolitic                
              Synthesis of Aluminum Nitride via Fluid Bed Calcination of Metal-              
              Organic Precursors" has been requested by the Center's Industry                
              Advisory Board.                                                                
                   Rutgers University research team will synthesize and granulate            
              aluminum nitride polymeric resins that City College will calcine               
              in a high temperature fluidization laboratory.                                 
                   The Program Manager recommends the City College of the City               
              University of New York be awarded $100,000 for two years as a                  
              Research Opportunity Award.
