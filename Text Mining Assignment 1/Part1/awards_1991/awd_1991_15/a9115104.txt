Abstract    :
              The topic of interacting binary star systems has become a nexus                
              of stellar astrophysics, searching as a bridge between traditional             
              studies of the evolution of single stars and the newer areas that              
              include the evolution of accretion disks around companions to                  
              expanding stars as well as of episodic "mass losers," such as                  
              B-emission and cataclysmic variable stars. In this two-year "RUI"              
              proposal (for undergraduate-only universities), the Principal                  
              Investigator and his collaborator, Dr. E. Olson of the University              
              of Illinois, will continue a program of simultaneous monitoring of             
              interacting binaries that include an evolving hot star ("Algol                 
              systems"). They will carry out observations at the 1-meter                     
              telescope of Mt. Laguna Observatory outside of San Diego. They will            
              use this facility in a dual mode, monitoring light and spectral                
              variations nearly simultaneously as these stars orbit around one               
              another every few days.  They will compare these data obtained                 
              throughout the orbital period for each star with models of                     
              accretion disks in which "non-LTE" effects are included.  This                 
              proposal is expected to include extensive involvement with                     
              undergraduate students.
