Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              Research  on the factors controlling the formation and abundance of            
              sulfide minerals, and associated trace metal behavior, in a variety            
              of modern and ancient environments has established that many trace             
              metals are extensively pyritized during early diagenesis.                      
              Additionally, studies have defined the interaction of metals with              
              the surface of pyrite and the coprecipitation of metals with                   
              mackinawite.                                                                   
                                                                                             
              The primary objectives of this research are  1) to experimentally              
              resolve the perplexing problem of how framboidal pyrite forms and              
              2) to study the coprecipitation of trace metals with this phase.               
              A variety of techniques will be used to attack this problem that               
              include long-term gel growth methods, and use of both "synthetic"              
              and natural sediments.
