Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                     Sediments from the eastern levee of the Amazon Fan show 0.18           
              values that indicate marked episodic changes in the deep.sea flow              
              regime during glacial times.  It is hypothesized that the Amazon               
              Fan is a climatically sensitive area of surface water return flow              
              to the area of deep.water formation in the North Atlantic.  To                 
              test this hypothesis, the PI will look for evidence of                         
              paleodischarge events via changes in the 0.18 content of                       
              planktonic foraminifera.  These cores already were collected by a              
              German cruise earlier this year.
