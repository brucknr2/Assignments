Abstract    :
              Funds are requested for the purchase of a Model TLX-120 Table-Top              
              Ultracentrifuge and Rotors from Beckman Instruments Inc.  This                 
              instrument will provide new investigative capacity in the                      
              Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology and will be an important                
              educational resource in the training of future independent                     
              investigators in contemporary molecular, cell and developmental                
              biology.  Specifically, it will make possible a variety of                     
              studies that must be conducted on very small amounts of                        
              biological materials (cells, constituent macromolecules and                    
              macromolecular assemblies) under conditions that minimize                      
              preparation time and maintain temperatures well below the                      
              ambient.  Example applications by the major users include                      
              analyses of: a) protein phosphorylation as an intracellular                    
              signal in flagellar motility: b) secretion granule function in                 
              cell-free assays; c) interaction of extracellular matrix                       
              components with purified and reconstituted integrins; d)                       
              kinesin/dynein interactions with microtubules and membrane-                    
              bounded organelles; and e) stage-specific RNAs isolated from                   
              embryonic tissues.  Comparable instrumentation is not available                
              for routine use by the identified major an minor users.
