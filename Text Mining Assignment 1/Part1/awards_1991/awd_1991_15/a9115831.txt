Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research in             
              experimental physical chemistry involving William Breckenridge                 
              and graduate students at the University of Utah and Benoit Soep                
              and Christophe Jouvet at the University of Paris, Orsay.  The                  
              investigators propose to develop new techniques for probing the                
              reaction dynamics of half collisions of electronically excited metal           
              atoms.                                                                         
                                                                                             
              Dr. Breckenridge brings to this collaboration his expertise in                 
              spectroscopy and chemical dynamics.  His laboratory has developed              
              the ability to synthesize complexes involving metal atoms with pure            
              hydrogen.  This is complemented by the French investigators'                   
              expertise and capabilities for conducting experiments involving a              
              pico-second laser system.  These experiments will provide                      
              information about physical and chemical processes that occur on                
              the surfaces of metal atoms.  By extending their work to the pico-             
              second region, the investigators will be able to characterize some             
              of the slower dynamical processes which occur during atom/atom                 
              collisions.
