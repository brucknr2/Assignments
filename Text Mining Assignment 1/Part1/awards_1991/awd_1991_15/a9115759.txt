Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Under an SBIR Phase II grant, a laser diagnostic instrument                    
              will be further developed for the diagnosis of bubbles due to                  
              cavitation in flow systems. The principle of the diagnostic                    
              method is phase doppler interferometry. Identification of                      
              particles as either solid or bubble, and determination of                      
              orientation and shape of bubbles, will be attempted with the                   
              new instrumentation first in preliminary validation                            
              experiments and then in actual cavitating conditions.                          
                                                                                             
              Cavitating flow diagnosis will permit better understanding of,                 
              and development of better predictive models for, flows                         
              applicable in chemical engineering, nuclear engineering, and                   
              biological systems.
