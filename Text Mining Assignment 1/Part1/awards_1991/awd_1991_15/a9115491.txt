Abstract    :
              Theoretical research will be done on a wide range of topics in                 
              condensed matter theory including quantum antiferromagnets with                
              impurities, the properties of flux line liquids, anyon theories of             
              superconductivity, the physics of red blood cells and polymerized              
              membranes with disorder, the behavior of directed polymer melts,               
              electrons in strong magnetic fields, transport in disordered                   
              systems, and spin glasses.
