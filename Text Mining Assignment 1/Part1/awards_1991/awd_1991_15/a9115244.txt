Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program                 
              will help the Department of Chemistry at Occidental College to                 
              acquire a Raman spectrometer with laser and variable                           
              temperature capability for use in the following research                       
              projects:                                                                      
                                                                                             
              1.  The determination of the mechanistic role and structure of                 
              various complexes present during electrophilic aromatic                        
              alkylation, chlorination and acylation-related reactions;                      
                                                                                             
              2.  The effects of metal-ion binding on the secondary structure                
              of calmodulin and other regulating proteins;                                   
                                                                                             
              3.  The photochemical reactivity of furocoumarins (psoralens)                  
              toward unsaturated compounds, such as thymine residues in DNA;                 
                                                                                             
              4.  A mechanistic study of the photochemical reactivity of                     
              flavins by laser-induced photo-CIDNP technique.                                
                                                                                             
              5.  The synthesis of bimetallic transition-metal complexes                     
              containing carbon-carbon triple bonds.                                         
                                                                                             
              Raman Spectroscopy is concerned with vibrational and rotational                
              transitions in molecules.  The information obtained sometimes                  
              complements that obtained from an infrared study and provides                  
              valuable structural information.   Fourier-transform Raman                     
              spectroscopy with near-infrared excitation provides a powerful                 
              solution to problems of high background fluorescene or sample                  
              photodegradation or photolability and enhanced signal-to-noise                 
              quality.  Raman spectroscopy is an invaluable tool in studies                  
              of condensed-phase chemical and biomolecular systems.
