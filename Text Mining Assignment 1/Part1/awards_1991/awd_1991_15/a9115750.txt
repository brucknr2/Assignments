Abstract    :
                   This award supports the cross-disciplinary efforts and the                
              development of research collaboration involving quantitative                   
              modelling in the geosciences.  In particular the collaborators                 
              will focus their attention on the statistical formulation of a                 
              useful prediction model for nonstationary climate data with                    
              problems of unequal scale.
