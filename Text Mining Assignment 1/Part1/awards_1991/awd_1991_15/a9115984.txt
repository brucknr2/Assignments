Abstract    :
                   This award supports the visit of three Soviet mathema-                    
              ticians, A.I. Kostrikin, M.I. Kuznetsov, and A.A. Premet, to the               
              University of Wisconsin.  They will join the principal                         
              investigators and other members of the U.S. community in joint                 
              studies and discussions on simple Lie algebras of prime                        
              characteristic and their representations, finite p-groups, and                 
              other closely related topics in algebra.  The problems to be                   
              investigated are all directly related to the theory of Lie                     
              algebras and primarily to the theory of Lie algebras of Cartan                 
              type.  They have many common threads suggesting that there are                 
              certain underlying principles that could explain the common                    
              phenomena.                                                                     
                   This research is concerned with a mathematical object called              
              a Lie algebra.  Lie algebras arise from another object called a                
              Lie group.  An example of a Lie group is the rotations of a                    
              sphere where one rotation is followed by another.  Lie groups and              
              Lie algebras are important in areas involving analysis of                      
              spherical motion.
