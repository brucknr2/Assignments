Abstract    :
              A four and half day conference devoted to pool and external                    
              flow boiling is proposed from March 23 to 27, 1992 in Santa                    
              Barbara, California.  Boiling is one of the most efficient                     
              modes of heat transfer.  Its applications encompass diverse                    
              engineering fields such as mechanical, chemical, nuclear and                   
              aerospace.  Boiling is also a very complex process.  Though                    
              considerable effort has been devoted to its study in the last                  
              50 years, the understanding is so incomplete that predictions                  
              cannot be made without the use of empirical constants.  The                    
              proposed conference will bring together                                        
              researchers from industry, government labs and universities in                 
                                                                                             
              Europe, Asia and the U.S. to assess the level of current                       
              understanding and to establish directions of future endeavors.                 
                                                                                             
              The conference is being sponsored by the Engineering                           
              Foundation and only modest funding is requested from the                       
              National Science Foundation.  Other funding is being sought                    
              from industry and other sources.
