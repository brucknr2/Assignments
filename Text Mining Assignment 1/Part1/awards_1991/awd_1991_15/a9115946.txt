Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                                                                                            
              Cadmium.to.calcium rations will be determined in corals and in                 
              the aragonite.depositing green alga Halimeda in Holocene reefs                 
              and bioherms from the Great Barrier Reef, Australia.  The                      
              objectives are:  (1) to determine Holocene variations in Cd/Ca                 
              ratios in outer shelf coral reefs, including records from reef                 
              initiation 8500 ybp to the present in cores representing leeward               
              to windward environments in individual reefs and from reefs                    
              spanning a range of latitudes; (2) to determine variations in                  
              seasonality in Cd/Ca ratios in Holocene Great Barrier Reef                     
              corals, comparing contemporary and selected historical corals;                 
              (3) to determine Holocene variations in Cd/Ca ratios in Great                  
              Barrier Reef Halimeda bioherms, from initiation (.2000 y before                
              coral reef initiation in the same latitude) to the present; and                
              (4) to interpret Cd/Ca records from coral and Halimeda to test                 
              hypotheses about the role of changing nutrient supply in                       
              controlling Holocene reef and bioherm growth in the Great Barrier              
              Reef.  Careful attention will be given to identifying and                      
              isolating trace element signals due to terrestrial, rather than                
              oceanographic influences, and to alteration.  Graphite furnace                 
              and flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry will be used to                  
              determine Cd/Ca, Mn/Ca, Sr/Ca, and Mg/Ca ratios; X.ray                         
              diffraction spectroscopy will be used to determine mineralogy.
