Abstract    :
                   Dr. Dennis Powers is the Director of Stanford University's                
              Hopkins Marine Station, located in Monterey, California.  The                  
              Station has a long and distinguished record of research support in             
              marine biology by Stanford faculty members and by visiting                     
              investigators.  Dr. Powers proposes construction of an addition                
              onto the Station's current open-air tank seawater system.  The                 
              addition would be an enclosed environmentally buffered building                
              dedicated to culturing and experimental studies of marine                      
              organisms.                                                                     
                   The proposed facility would increase the quality and impact               
              of research projects currently underway at the Station, and would              
              attract new investigators and their students to the facility.                  
              Marine labs such as the Hopkins Marine Station will have increasing            
              impact on research in fields such as biomedical science, ecology,              
              evolutionary theory, oceanography, and global climate change.                  
              Providing these institutions with adequate facilities and                      
              instrumentation is essential for the U.S. research community.
