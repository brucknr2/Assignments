Abstract    :
              In this project funded by the Theoretical and Computational                    
              Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Stevens will                      
              develop a method of saccharide conformational analysis from                    
              chiroptical measurements.  The calculational model relates                     
              saccharide optical rotation to geometry-dependent interactions                 
              among bond-localized electronic transitions.  The technique                    
              will be used in studies of geometry and conformational energy                  
              of a variety of saccharides including mannose, agarose,                        
              carrageenan, and subsequently extended to include some                         
              C-disaccharides.                                                               
              %%%                                                                            
              Complex sugars have fundamental biological significance and are                
              also useful in technology because of their physical and                        
              chemical properties.  The ability to predict such properties by                
              molecular modeling is developing rapidly, but further develop-                 
              ment requires guidance by experiment interpreted by advanced                   
              theoretical methods.  Stevens will develop a procedure for                     
              interpreting measurements of the rotation of the plane of                      
              polarized light in terms of the geometrical conformation of the                
              sugar molecule responsible for the effect.  The experiments can                
              then be more broadly used to evaluate saccharide force fields                  
              for use in the modeling procedures.
