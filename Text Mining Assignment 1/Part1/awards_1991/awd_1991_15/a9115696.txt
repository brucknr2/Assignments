Abstract    :
                   Research on collective modes and dynamical transport                      
              coefficients of strongly coupled plasmas using analytical                      
              techniques are carried forward.  In particular the Quasi                       
              Localized Charge Model developed during the last few years                     
              will be applied to the calculation of dielectric response                      
              tensors and collective mode structures for Coulomb liquids at                  
              strong coupling.  Applications include dense, hot plasmas,                     
              electron gas in metals, molten salts, liquid metals, two-                      
              dimensional electron liquids at the interface of dielectric                    
              materials, superlattices and binary ionic mixtures.  The non-                  
              perturbative approaches used in the current research allow                     
              computations where customary perturbation methods are                          
              inadequate.
