Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              Factors affecting metal mobility in and near the low pressure                  
              supercritical region of seawater will be investigated in two                   
              specific areas of research:                                                    
                                                                                             
              (1)  The effect of temperature, pressure, pH, dissolved Cl and                 
              redox intensity on the thermodynamic stability of base metal                   
              (Fe, Pb, Zn and Cu) and Au-ion complexes.  Results of recent                   
              experiments have unambiguously demonstrated the highly                         
              significant role of pressure on the relative stability of Fe-                  
              chloro complexes at elevated temperatures for fluids of seawater               
              dissolved Cl.  It is essential that these data be extended to                  
              higher temperatures and especially involve fluids of higher and                
              lower dissolved Cl concentrations.                                             
                                                                                             
              (2)  Phase equilibria constraints on dissolved concentrations of               
              neutral species such as H2 and H2S.  On-going research has                     
              clarified greatly the role of temperature and pressure on                      
              activity-concentration relations and "salting-out" behavior                    
              involving H2(aq) and H2S(aq) for fluids of seawater dissolved Cl               
              concentration.  These results need to be extended to higher                    
              temperatures, and especially higher and lower pressures and                    
              dissolved Cl concentrations.  Dissolved H2 and H2S activities,                 
              and activity-concentration relations, constrain metal mobility,                
              and can be used for some hot spring systems to reveal subseafloor              
              temperatures and pressures.
