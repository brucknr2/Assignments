Abstract    :
              This is a proposal for a workshop on power electronics                         
              education.  The purpose of the workshop is to                                  
              introduce new approaches to teaching the subject to                            
              university professors.  An emphasis of this workshop                           
              will be the hands-on demonstration of simulation                               
              software that can be used for teaching purposes.
