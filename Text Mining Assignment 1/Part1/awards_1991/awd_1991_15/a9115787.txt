Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal plans to study the structure of borate glasses, and              
              the low temperature spin dynamics of the boron and oxygen sites,               
              through the use of a number of techniques including dynamic angle              
              spinning (DAS), magic angle spinning (MAS), 2D exchange NMR, and               
              low-field nuclear quadruple resonance.  The proposed program plans             
              also to determine the chemical and configurational orderings in a              
              range of IV-V-VI non-oxide chalcogenide glasses and study the                  
              effect of network connectivity on the nuclear spin relaxation.                 
              %%%%                                                                           
              This research will provide information which can aim greatly our               
              understanding of glass structures.  The use of dynamic technique               
              provides the prospect of a detailed characterization of  the                   
              disorder in glasses containing quadrupolar nuclei.  This may be                
              especially important when quadrupolar nuclei are the network                   
              forming cations.  The dynamic information may be more important in             
              providing link between general glass theory and the physical                   
              meaning of the theoretical concepts.
