Abstract    :
              "Some Research Problems on Hydrogen in Planetary Upper                         
              Atmospheres and the Interplanetary/Interstellar Medium"                        
              Superficially the common thread to the various problems described              
              in this proposal is "hydrogen at low density", but actually these              
              problems are the outgrowth of ones that have occupied the P.I. in              
              one form or another throughout his research career of over 40                  
              years.  We expect to be absorbed with the first two problems in                
              the first year of the grant; we will turn our attention to the                 
              3rd and 4th problems in the second and third years, as progress                
              with the first two and the subsequent availability of time                     
              permit.                                                                        
              All the problems deal with matter at very low densities: the                   
              upper atmospheres of planets, exospheres and magnetospheres, and               
              interplanetary/interstellar space.  The problems are all                       
              theoretical in nature; to the extent that computational data                   
              analysis is required, we have an IBM PS/2 (an 80386 machine with               
              a 387 math coprocessor) for our exclusive use when required.  In               
              addition, should more powerful computers be needed, we have ready              
              access to Sun workstations, an Apollo DN10000,  and a DEC                      
              Microvax II, all within the Department of Space Physics and                    
              Astronomy.  Also the Rice University computing center has a                    
              mainframe IBM 3090.
