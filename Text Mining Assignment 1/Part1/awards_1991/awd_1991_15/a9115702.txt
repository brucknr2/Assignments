Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This three-year award supports U.S.-France                                     
              cooperative research in physical chemistry                                     
              between Eric A. Gislason of the University of                                  
              Chicago and Muriel Sizun and P.M. Guyon of the                                 
              University of Paris, Orsay.  The investigators                                 
              propose to continue experimental and                                           
              theoretical studies of ion-molecule collisions.                                
              They will examine the charge transfer of                                       
              diatomic ions, extend their earlier work on                                    
              helium and hydrogen collisions, and develop a                                  
              new, sequential model for energy transfer in                                   
              atom-diatom collisions.                                                        
                                                                                             
              Dr. Gislason brings to this project extensive                                  
              experience in theoretical and experimental                                     
              research of ion-molecule collisions.                                           
              His current research deals with the theory of                                  
              molecular vibration in transition phases.  This                                
              is complemented by the French investigators                                    
              expertise in experimental aspects of                                           
              ion-molecule collisions.  The  project will                                    
              benefit from access to the synchrotron facility                                
              at the University of Paris, Orsay, one of the                                  
              world's centers for ion-molecule collision                                     
              studies.  And their combined efforts will                                      
              advance our understanding of the behavior of                                   
              molecules in the aggregate and the importance                                  
              of ion-molecule collisions in low pressure                                     
              processing plasmas.
