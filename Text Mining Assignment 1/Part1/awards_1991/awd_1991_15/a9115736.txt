Abstract    :
                   Pelagic biogeography, the study of the distribution of                    
              organisms in the open ocean, has been limited by the inability to              
              determine the genetic composition and structure of marine                      
              species.  Dr. George Matsumoto and colleagues will try to apply                
              new molecular systematic methods of DNA analysis to samples of                 
              two poorly known groups of pelagic organisms, siphonophores and                
              ctenophores.  Emphasis in the laboratory will be placed on                     
              analyzing mitochondrial DNA and ribosomal DNA, because of the                  
              demonstrated utility of these classes of DNA in other animal                   
              groups.  If successful, the study will yield data that will help               
              characterize the genetic diversity and differences within and                  
              among groups of these colonial invertebrates.                                  
                   The organisms under study have gelatinous outer sheaths,                  
              which present special problems for the extraction and analysis of              
              DNA.  Thus, the SGER mechanism is especially appropriate for                   
              support of this exploratory research.
