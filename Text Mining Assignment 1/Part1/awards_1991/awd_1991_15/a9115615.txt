Abstract    :
              In this project funded by the Theoretical and Computational                    
              Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Singer will                       
              perform mixed quantum/classical theoretical calculations on                    
              three systems of fundamental scientific interest and                           
              technological relevance:  (1) the hydrated proton, (2) the                     
              catalytic site of zeolite, and (3) metal/rare gas clusters.  He                
              will also explore new theoretical methods for a simulated                      
              annealing treatment of many-electron solutes and electron-                     
              solvent pseudopotentials.

              Many chemical processes, including those of living organisms,                  
              occur in water solution.  Singer's work on the hydrated proton                 
              will pave the way for treating proton exchange reactions of                    
              such systems.  His work on zeolites deals with the active site                 
              of a class of catalysts of vital importance in the petroleum                   
              industry.  The new theoretical methods he seeks will be of                     
              value in future studies of chemical processes in solution.
