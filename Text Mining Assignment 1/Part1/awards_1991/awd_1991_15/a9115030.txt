Abstract    :
              The expulsion of their envelopes by red supergiants is a                       
              crucial moment in an intermediate-mass star's history. The                     
              expelled envelope glows from the light of the hot remant                       
              core of the star and is called a "planetary nebula." The                       
              remnant eventually cools to become a white dwarf star enriched                 
              in intermediate elements such as C,N,O,Ne.  In this three-year                 
              renewal award, the Principal Investigator (PI) will study                      
              both the structure of the nebulae from recent images in the                    
              light of various molecules and the evolutionary paths of the proto-            
              white dwarfs defined by different masses and chemical abundances               
              of the initial star.  It is expected that this group will add to               
              their already substantial contributions to our understanding of                
              this critical juncture in stellar evolution.
