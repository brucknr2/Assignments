Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The proposal comprises three projects, each investigating phase-               
              coherent effects in microfabricated, multiply connected, thin-film             
              structures, each requiring sensitive dc-SQUID magnetometry or                  
              potentiometry to probe the phase coherence and phase dynamics:  1)             
              Macroscopic quantum phase phenomena - a study of macroscopic                   
              quantum tunneling in multidimensional systems to test the validity             
              and applicability of quantum mechanics to macroscop-ic physical                
              systems.  2) Phase coherence and vortex dynamics in superconducting            
              arrays - measurement of the static vortex config-uration in arrays             
              by a scanning SQUID detector and vortex dynam-ics by noise and non-            
              equilibrium transport experiments.  3) Phase coherence in                      
              mesoscopic devices - measurement of persistent currents and                    
              screening in normal-metal rings, arrays and SQUIDS to study the                
              role of phase coherence and scattering.                                        
                                                                                             
                                         %%%                                                 
                                                                                             
              Phase-coherence effects in superconductors and in normal-metal                 
              "nanostructures" are important both in the development of high-                
              sensitivity detectors and other electronic devices, and in the                 
              study of the fundamentals of condensed-matter physics.
