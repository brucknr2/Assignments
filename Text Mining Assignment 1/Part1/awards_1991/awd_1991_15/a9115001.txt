Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The primary objective of this research is to clarify the ecology of            
              a little studied species of lemur, Lemur macaco.  This species is              
              indigenous to a threatened habitat, primary lowland rainforest, and            
              has recently spread into converted forest.  The research aims to               
              determine the affects of the varying habitat on the feeding and                
              ranging behaviors, group size and composition and activity cycles              
              in the two forms of forest.                                                    
                                                                                             
              A number of specific predictions are made as to the influence of               
              habitat on the group parameters.  Data to test the hypotheses will             
              be gathered by standard observational techniques and by analysis of            
              ecological variables pertaining to forest composition and                      
              structure.
