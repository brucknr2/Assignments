Abstract    :
              Dr. Michael Greenberg is the Scientific Director of the                        
              University of Florida's Whitney Marine Laboratory, located in                  
              Marineland, Florida.  The Lab is well known for its use of marine              
              animals in neurological and cell biology research, and it                      
              supports a variety of research projects that require lab                       
              facilities for microscopy and molecular techniques.  In                        
              particular, recent growth in the Lab's activities in histology                 
              and microscopy have strained the resources available to resident               
              and visiting researchers.  To serve these increasing demands, Dr.              
              Greenberg proposes to renovate one microscopy.                                 
                                                                                             
              These additions will increase the Lab's ability to host visiting               
              research projects.  A variety of biological disciplines will                   
              benefit from the enhanced capabilities of this research facility.
