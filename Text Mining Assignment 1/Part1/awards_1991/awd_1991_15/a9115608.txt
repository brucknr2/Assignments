Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              Oxidative marine photochemical reactions are an important step in              
              modifying and remineralizing terrestrially-derived DOM, as shown in            
              individual examples and indirect mechanistic evidence.  Important              
              classes of marine-derived DOM probably also enter this cycle.  This            
              project will quantify total photooxidative processes as oxygen                 
              consumption, by (1) direct O2 uptake measurements where sensitivity            
              permits, and (2) using an indirect method sensitive enough for                 
              "blue water" and for low-reactivity coastal water studies.  The                
              results will provide much-needed quantitative evaluation of the                
              role of photooxidation in oceanic carbon and oxygen cycles.                    
                                                                                             
              Oxygen consumption, closely related to DOM oxidation, will be                  
              measured in coastal and estuarine waters and in organic matter                 
              concentrated by hydrophobic adsorption.  Direct O2 uptake will be              
              measured using pulsed polarographic electrodes with automated data             
              acquisition.  A sensitive new indirect technique, calibrated                   
              empirically against direct measurements, will quantify fluxes of               
              the primary O2 -consuming species in "blue" and low-activity                   
              coastal waters.  Effects of variables such as wavelength, light                
              intensity, temperature, oxygen concentration, and prolonged                    
              photolysis on O2 consumption rates will be investigated to                     
              understand their (bio) geochemical significance and to identify the            
              major mechanisms involved in O2 uptake/C remineralization.
