Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will conduct research in three                 
              areas of the theory of stochastic processes and related partial                
              differential equations.  The first area is concerned with proving              
              the large deviation principle for Markov stochastic processes                  
              with "discontinuous statistics," a class that includes diffusions              
              with discontinuous drift and small diffusion coefficient as well               
              as certain scaled queueing systems.  The second area considers                 
              the problem of obtaining the full asymptotic expansion for                     
              certain important classes of jump Markov processes.  The last                  
              part of the proposed work involves research in the area of                     
              numerical methods for continuous time stochastic control                       
              problems.                                                                      
                   The principal investigator will conduct research on several               
              problems that are at the interface of stochastic processes, a                  
              branch of probability theory, and stochastic control, a branch of              
              applied mathematics.  The problems are motivated by issues                     
              involved with understanding systems of queues, which arise                     
              naturally in several applications, for example communications.
