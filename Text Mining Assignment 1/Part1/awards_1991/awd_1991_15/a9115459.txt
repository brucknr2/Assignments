Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award, made to one of the pioneers and leaders in the field               
              of large-scale structure studies, will fund the investigation of               
              peculiar motions in the Perseus-Pisces supercluster of galaxies.               
              The detailed motions of the galaxies observed, will, in turn,                  
              permit the determination of the mass distribution in this very                 
              massive and relatively near-by supercluster.  This should help to              
              understand how such very large and highly structured collections               
              of galaxies are formed.
