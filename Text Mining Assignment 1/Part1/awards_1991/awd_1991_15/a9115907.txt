Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The Johnson-Sealink will be used to examine a section of the              
              SE Atlantic continental margin where active aquifer discharge and              
              its effect can be established.  The processes by which this and                
              other processes may erode the margin and produce its morphology                
              will be studied as well as whether the coral bioherms are karst                
              pinnacles rather than actual bioherms.  In the process, the                    
              stratigraphy of the Florida-Hatteras slope will be refined.
