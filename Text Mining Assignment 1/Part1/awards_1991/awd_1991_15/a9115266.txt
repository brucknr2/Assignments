Abstract    :
                   K. C. Weathers is the Manager of Laboratory Facilities at                 
              the Institute of Ecosystems Studies, which is a part of the New                
              York Botanical Garden.  She requests support for acquisition of                
              an inorganic ion (ammonia, chloride, nitrate, and phosphorous)                 
              analyzer that would: 1) increase the number of samples analyzed,               
              2) decrease the amount of toxic waste generated, 3) produce                    
              results in digital rather than strip-chart form, and 4) be easier              
              to maintain and service than the equipment currently in use.                   
                   The instrument would be used in a variety of research                     
              projects run by resident and visiting scientists, especially                   
              those investigating nutrient cycling through food webs and                     
              processes of decomposition in forests.  Adding this ion analyzer               
              to the facilities at the Institute for Ecosystem Studies would                 
              have a significant impact on many important scientific                         
              investigations.
