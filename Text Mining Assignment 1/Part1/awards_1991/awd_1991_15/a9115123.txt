Abstract    :
                   This infrastructure award is for the acquisition of                       
              equipment to support research in distributed and parallel                      
              computing.  The equipment consists of a network of workstations                
              to support distributed processing research and an upgrade to an                
              existing SIMD computer.  The research supported includes the                   
              evaluation of parallel random access algorithms, numerical                     
              algorithms for modeling the flow of particles through a host                   
              medium, sequence planning for manufacturing, fault tolerance and               
              load balancing in distributed networks, dynamic hard real time                 
              applications in a distributed environment, designing distributed               
              real time intelligent systems, and the development of a wide area              
              distributed robotics network.                                                  
                                                                                             
                   The future increases in raw computational power will come                 
              from the utilization of many processors to work on computational               
              problems.  There are many research problems associated with the                
              effective utilization of many processors.  These range from how                
              the processors should communicate to the development of new                    
              algorithms to take advantage of multiple processors.  Texas A&M                
              University is building up a parallel computer laboratory and a                 
              distributed computer laboratory to perform experimental research               
              on these issues.
