Abstract    :
              The staple of the field of observational stellar evolution                     
              is the study of the form of the Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram                    
              (stellar surface temperature vs. luminosity) of star clusters.                 
              Using a new wide-field CCD (Charge Coupled Device) camera and                  
              over a two year period, the the Principal and Co-Investigators will            
              obtain accurate colors and brightnesses of the brighter stars in               
              50 globular clusters and place them on a uniform scale.  These                 
              results will be used to derive the cluster ages and structural                 
              properties of the stars as they evolve off the "main sequence",                
              become red giants, and ultimately "horizontal branch stars."
