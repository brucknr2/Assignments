Abstract    :
              Solar plasma energetics is a subject which has applications not                
              only to astronomers but also to practical applications for nuclear             
              fusion containment (tokamaks) and the disruption of the Earth's                
              magneto-sphere and radio communications.  In a previous award the              
              Principal Investigator (PI) has combined simultaneous observations             
              from x-ray satellites and the ground observatory in Hawaii to                  
              follow the development of solar flares at high time resolution.                
              His results show for the first time that momentum is conserved in              
              flare plasma (gas), a conclusion which puts significance                       
              constraints on models of flare development in the solar chromo-                
              sphere and lower corona.  The new award is an Accomplishment Based             
              Renewal Award based on the long-term excellent record of his group.            
              The new work will extend his work to a number of new areas,                    
              including new spectral lines carrying separate information and                 
              observations of active solar-type stars.  The latter group is                  
              designed to determine whether the extent to  which certain                     
              processes responsible for solar flare production are at play in                
              these stars, thus advancing the place of solar flare physics in                
              the research area known as the "solar-stellar connection."
