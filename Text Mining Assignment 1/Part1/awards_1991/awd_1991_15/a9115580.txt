Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Dr. Campins will continue an ongoing study of Earth-approaching                
              comets.  This study involves an observational approach pioneered               
              very successfully by Dr. Campins in the study of Comets Neujmin 1,             
              Arend-Regaux, and Tempel 2.  This approach employs simultaneous                
              visible and infrared wavelength observations of comets that pass               
              within 1.5 Astronomical Units of Earth.  The observations will                 
              yield the size, albedo, color, rotational characteristics and                  
              approximate shape of the nuclei of several comets chosen for study.            
              The results obtained from the previous study of three comets, and              
              the results from Comet Halley, have provided tantalizing insights              
              into the nature of cometary nuclei; however, the sample of properly            
              observed comets consists of only four objects.  The goal of this               
              project is to double this number over the next three years.                    
              Knowledge of the nuclear properties for a statistically meaningful             
              sample of comets will allow general conclusions to be drawn about              
              the processes that determine these properties, and about the                   
              relationship between  comets and other minor bodies in the Solar               
              System, such as Earth-approaching asteroids, and meteorites.
