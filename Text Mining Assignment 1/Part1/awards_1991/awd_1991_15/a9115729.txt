Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Ocean modelling suggests that the effect of the closure of central             
              American isthmus on ocean circulation was greater than previously              
              suspected.  The PI will continue his sensitivity experiments on the            
              effect of oceanic gateways through the simulation of the Ocean                 
              General Circulation model.  He will also focus on the equatorial               
              ocean model which is interactive with atmosphere to test the                   
              upwelling patterns in equatorial Pacific.  The results of these                
              modelling experiments will lead to understanding of the causes for             
              changes in Cenozoic oceanic circulation.
