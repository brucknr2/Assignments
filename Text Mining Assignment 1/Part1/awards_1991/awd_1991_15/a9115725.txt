Abstract    :
              This research involves the experimental analysis of delayed                    
              consistency in large-scale cache-based multiprocessors including its           
              effects on false sharing and latency tolerance.  False sharing refers          
              to the read/write sharing of cache blocks in the absence of data               
              sharing in a parallel computation.   Latency tolerance refers to the           
              reduction of the average latency of shared-memory accesses by                  
              overlapping them with computation.                                             
                                                                                             
              Delayed consistency takes advantage of weak ordering in cache-based            
              systems.  The sending of cache invalidation can be delayed, in which           
              case they can be overlapped with processor accesses to the cache.              
              Additionally, both the sending and receiving of invalidations can be           
              delayed, in which case false sharing effects are reduced by increasing         
              the time during which cached blocks remain accessible by each local            
              processor.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              The quantitative effects of delaying consistency and its variants will         
              be evaluated through execution-driven simulation of parallel benchmark         
              programs, including nine parallel numerical as well as non-numerical           
              algorithms and thirteen Fortran programs contained in the Perfect Club         
              Benchmark suite, parallelized using an Alliant 2800 compiler.                  
              Emphasis will be on the effects of block size, cache size, and                 
              granularity of parallelism.  Statistics will be collected not only on          
              miss rates, but also on memory traffic, on memory access latencies and         
              on total execution times.
