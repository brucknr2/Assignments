Abstract    :
                   This is a proposal to develop an undergraduate computer                   
              engineering curriculum in the Department of Computer Science and               
              Engineering.  All the existing courses in the Computer Science and             
              Engineering curriculum will be redesigned to include the use of CAD            
              tools, programmable devices and hardware description languages.  After         
              initial development of the project, the principal investigator plans           
              to coordinate development of these types of educational resources in           
              selected 2--year colleges in the Southwest.
