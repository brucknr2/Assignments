Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A series of laboratory experiments using state-of-the-art                      
              techniques aimed at quantitatively studying the interaction between            
              short and long surface waves will be conducted.  Detailed                      
              measurements of the waves and associated kinetic and potential                 
              energy field will be made in two laboratory facilities (SIO and                
              Delf Hydraulics) to examine the effects of wave scale and wave age.
