Abstract    :
              This research investigates the structure and ecological                        
              organization of a coastal marine assemblage characterized by a                 
              brown algal canopy, and a conspicuous pavement of crustose and                 
              articulated coralline algae.  The presence of the latter is                    
              associated with a rich mix of invertebrate grazers.  A                         
              monitoring program will estimate the variation characteristics                 
              of the entire assemblage and experiments will be initiated to                  
              examine how community complexity effects interactions among                    
              taxa.   Specific questions addressed will include, (1) does                    
              the complexity of multispecific competition generate an outcome                
              different from that predicted by pair-wise experiments?  (2) Do                
              crusts inhibit recruitment of brown algal sporelings?  And (3)                 
              will herbivore addition inhibit, or enhance, algal                             
              recruitment.  These experiments and their measures will relate                 
              to species interaction strength, in the ecology of complex                     
              systems; a neglected aspect of food web theory.
