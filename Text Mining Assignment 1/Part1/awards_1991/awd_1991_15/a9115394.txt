Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program                 
              will help the Department of Chemistry at Georgetown University                 
              acquire an entire new integrated single crystal x-ray                          
              diffractometer and structure analysis system, with rotating                    
              anode generator and low temperature capabilitities.  Among the                 
              areas of chemical research that will be enhanced by the                        
              acquisition are the following:

              Single crystal x-ray crystallography is the most powerful                      
              analytical method for structure determination of solids.  In                   
              synthetic inorganic, organic, bioinorganic and organometallic                  
              chemistry, single crystal x-ray diffraction is an invaluable                   
              tool to characterize molecular structure.  The information                     
              gained from the knowledge of the intermolecular composition and                
              structure helps to develop new reactions of potentially general                
              interest in catalysis or organic synthesis.
