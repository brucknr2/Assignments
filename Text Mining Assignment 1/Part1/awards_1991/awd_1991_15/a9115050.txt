Abstract    :
              This award primarily supports U.S. participation in a                          
              U.S.-Latin American Regional Workshop on Molecular                             
              Approaches to Membrane Biophysics, held at the Centro                          
              de Estudios Cientificos de Santiago (CECS), Chile,                             
              November 20-December 7, 1991.  Organizers are Michael                          
              White, University of Pennsylvania, and Pedro Labarca,                          
              CECS.                                                                          
                                                                                             
              The purposes of the workshop are:  to convene U.S.-                            
              Latin American researchers in membrane biophysics and                          
              biochemistry, for exchanging ideas; to introduce Latin                         
              American participants to basic principles of molecular                         
              biology applied to membrane biophysics; and to develop                         
              collaboration between Latin American biophysicists and                         
              U.S. researchers using molecular biological approaches                         
              to membrane biophysics.  The U.S. side will benefit                            
              from establishment of Latin American contacts to                               
              develop research themes for future projects.  The                              
              Latin American participants will gain information                              
              about molecular biology applied to membrane                                    
              biophysics, and from exchanging ideas for future U.S.                          
              collaboration.  The workshop's topics and agenda                               
              fulfill goals of the Science in Developing Countries                           
              program.
