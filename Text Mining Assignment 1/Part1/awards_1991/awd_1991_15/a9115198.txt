Abstract    :
              X-ray satellites have discovered a new and common group "binary"               
              systems in which both stars have low (solar-like) masses.  Other               
              properties of them are poorly known largely because they are at                
              great distances from the Sun and in directions where absorption by             
              interstellar gas makes their true brightnesses and hence distances             
              ambiguous.  In previous work the Principal Investigator (PI) has               
              discovered the optical counterparts to these new x-ray sources and             
              has monitored their optical output and radial velocities to learn              
              more about their binary characteristics that enable us to                      
              understand the reason for their x-ray emission.  In the present                
              three year study the PI will study a sample of these objects in                
              the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC).  Because these sources are at a              
              common distance their properties can actually be defined better                
              than those in our own Galaxy.  This work is expected to delineate              
              differences between x-ray sources in our Galaxy and the LMC, for               
              example, in terms of differences in heavy metal content.  The PI's             
              past work has led to the discovery of the first black-hole in an               
              eclipsing binary (leading to a direct estimate of the mass of the              
              black hole).  This work is expected also to clarify the existence              
              of these exotic objects.
