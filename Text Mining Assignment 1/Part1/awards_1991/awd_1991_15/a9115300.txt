Abstract    :
                   Dr. Sandra Vargo is the Associate Director of the Florida                 
              Institute of Oceanography of the University of South Florida.                  
              The Institute, in partnership with the Florida Department of                   
              Natural Resources, operates the Keys Marine Laboratory on the                  
              site of a former Sea World theme park on Long Key.  Keys Marine                
              Lab is uniquely situated for mainland research on tropical marine              
              habitats, and the Lab is actively used for State-sponsored                     
              research.  Dr. Vargo plans to improve the Lab's research                       
              capabilities by acquiring items of basic lab equipment for                     
              general use (balances, a deionized water supply system, a pH                   
              meter, four microscopes, two centrifuges, and a low temperature                
              freezer).  The Keys Marine Lab is a potentially important                      
              research facility with a growing number of active on-site                      
              research projects.                                                             
              The new instrumentation will make it possible for the Lab's                    
              impact to grow as investigators establish research programs                    
              there.  Research into fragile marine and coastal tropical                      
              environments is currently constrained by the lack of adequate and              
              easily accessible research facilities.  The continued growth of                
              the Keys Marine Lab will open up new research opportunities in                 
              marine science.
