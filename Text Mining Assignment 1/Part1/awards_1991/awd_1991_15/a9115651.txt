Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will support the participation of ten U.S. scientists in a          
              U.S.-Japan Seminar on Biochemistry and Molecular Biology of                    
              Membrane and Storage Lipids of Plants, to be held December 14-                 
              16, 1992 in Kona, Hawaii.  The co-organizers are Professor                     
              Christopher Somerville, Plant Research Laboratory, Michigan State              
              University, and Professor Norio Murata, Department of Regulation               
              Biology, National Institute for Basic Biology, Okazaki, Japan.                 
              This seminar will provide a forum for representatives of the major             
              academic and industrial research laboratories in the United States             
              and Japan, as well as major academic research groups in four                   
              European countries, to exchange up to date information and explore             
              possible collaboration.                                                        
                                                                                             
              The significance of the topic of the seminar lies in the fact that             
              membrane lipid composition is thought to be a major component of               
              chilling tolerance in higher plants.  In addition, the composition of          
              dietary vegetable oils has significant health effects and the                  
              composition of non-food oils determines the utility of the oils for a          
              wide range of non-food industrial applications.  Recent advances in            
              plant molecular biology have raised the possibility of using genetic           
              engineering techniques to modify oil composition and the cold                  
              tolerance of plants by rational genetic modification of crop species           
              using cloned genes.  Since most of the research groups with                    
              expertise in both biochemistry and molecular biology are in the                
              United States and Japan, their meeting in this seminar along with              
              some of their European colleagues should prove fruitful.
