Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project supports the dissertation research of a cultural                  
              anthropology student from the University of Arizona.  The project              
              will study the cultural models local people use in dealing with                
              the "troubles" in Northern Ireland between Catholics and                       
              Protestants.  Using the methods of ethnography (in-depth                       
              interviews about life histories, participant observation) as well              
              as a small survey of households, the student will investigate                  
              significant processes underlying ongoing interpretations of                    
              conflict among rural Protestants who live in the border area of                
              County Armagh.  The project will add to scholarship on                         
              interpretive aspects of group conflict and the "sectarian divide"              
              between Protestants and Catholics in Northern Ireland.                         
                                                                                             
              This research is important because the roots of such enduring                  
              conflict are invariably cultural, reproduced in the daily                      
              household experiences of people as they grow up and live their                 
              lives.  Increased understanding of the specific content and forms              
              of conflict reproduction can help planners and officials design                
              programs to ameliorate the causes and reduce the strength of the               
              mechanisms that maintain the conflict.
