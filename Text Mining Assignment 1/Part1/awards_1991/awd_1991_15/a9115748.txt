Abstract    :
                   This award supports the cross-disciplinary efforts and the                
              development of research collaboration involving quantitative                   
              modelling in the geosciences.  In particular this research team                
              of a statistician and a geologist will focus on the development                
              of bivariate time series methodology suitable for the analysis of              
              varve records for the purpose of dating.
