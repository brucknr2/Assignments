Abstract    :
                   This project addresses the design and testing of a system                 
              for improving time dissemination on computer networks.  The                    
              system consists of two parts: 1) servers whose clocks are                      
              calibrated using dial-up telephone links to the NIST primary time              
              scale, and 2) clients who request calibration data from                        
              the servers via either a local- or wide-area network.  The                     
              servers and clients construct models of the performance of the                 
              local clock and the calibration channel, and use these models to               
              adjust the local time and the interval between calibrations to                 
              maintain a specified accuracy.  The Internet is being used to                  
              compare the performance of the method with other systems.                      
                   The method is simpler and potentially more accurate than the              
              existing Network TIme Protocol because:  1) there can be many                  
              more primary servers since they require no special hardware.  The              
              network distance between any client and a primary server                       
              therefore can be quite short.  2) The channel between NIST and                 
              each primary server is easier to characterize because it is                    
              stable and reciprocal to a high degree.  The result is either                  
              less frequent calibrations for the same level of accuracy or                   
              improved performance at the same calibration interval.
