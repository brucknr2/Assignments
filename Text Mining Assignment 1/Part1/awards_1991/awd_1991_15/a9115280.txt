Abstract    :
                 This is the first year of a two-year continuing award.  The                 
              research focuses on the development of novel image description                 
              operators based on the notion of Gaussian Wavelet Groups (GWG).                
              These groups are synthesized in clusters that have high cojoint                
              spatial-frequency resolution and are also efficient in detection               
              and localization of shapes directly from gray-scale images.                    
              Specialized GWGs will be developed that are capable of measuring               
              various shape descriptors such as location, orientation, size and              
              boundary curvature.  The GWGs will be generated in real time by                
              novel lattice networks.  To describe whole shapes, a novel                     
              topological structure called a scale-spinal-graph (SSG) will be                
              developed, along with a network that can generate the SSG with                 
              parallel operations.  The project will also develop an efficient               
              image representation scheme using clusters of GWGs, for real time              
              image compression.
