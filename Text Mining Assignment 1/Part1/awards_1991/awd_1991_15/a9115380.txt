Abstract    :
              The objectives of this research are to validate current and                    
              proposed composite micromechanical models by direct experimental               
              measurements and to determine the resulting stress state near                  
              damaged regions in materials subjected to tensile, compressive, and            
              bending loads.  This will be accomplished with a unique test                   
              methodology which employs a geometrically scaled up version of an              
              polymeric composite containing embedded sensors.  These sensors                
              provide a direct and systematic approach to measure strain                     
              redistribution in a material and provides previously unobtainable              
              baseline data which are essential in validating existing models and            
              developing new ones.
