Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              This award will support a U.S.-France Workshop in high                         
              performance polymers organized jointly by Matthew Tirrell of the               
              University of Minnesota, Alain Michel of the Laboratory of                     
              Organic Materials, and Alain Fradel of Pierre and Marie Curie                  
              University, Paris, France.  New developments in high performance               
              polymer materials are of technological importance in                           
              microelectronics, ceramics, medicine and separation processes.                 
              The workshop will focus on the development of high performance                 
              properties beyond the current norm.  They will address developing              
              multicomponent materials of increased strength, chemical or                    
              thermal resistance, enhanced electrical conductivity, improved                 
              nonlinear optical properties, and effectiveness as interfacial agents.         
              Multicomponent refers to existing composites, copolymers, blends,              
              grafts and semicrystalline materials.  The workshop participants               
              will exchange information and review the state of the art in this              
              area.                                                                          
                                                                                             
              This workshop will bring together strong French expertise and                  
              tradition in macromolecular chemistry and American experience                  
              spanning the range of chemical synthesis to processing.  It is                 
              expected that future research areas, including joint activities, will          
              be defined.
