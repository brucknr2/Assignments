Abstract    :
              This award will support the research of Dr. Havel, who will develop            
              new computational methods and software for determining the                     
              conformational states and kinematic behavior of mobile molecules by            
              means of geometric reasoning.  The resultant computer programs are             
              expected to be of value to researchers in many areas of structural             
              chemistry and biochemistry, including spectroscopists who wish to              
              interpret their data in terms of a precise molecular modes,                    
              stereochemists who need to find all conformers consistent with a               
              given bonding arrangement, and molecular biologists attempting to              
              predict protein and nucleic acid conformation.  Because a wide                 
              variety of information concerning the structure of molecules can be            
              encoded in terms of constraints on their interatomic distances, the            
              first goal is to improve understanding of and ability to reason                
              directly with these constraints.  The next goal is to devise more              
              efficient and reliable methods of finding atomic coordinates                   
              compatible with the constraints, and  determining what motions are             
              consistent with them.  The final goal is to have the resulting                 
              program integrated into a widely available molecular mechanics                 
              package, so that they can be easily applied to a wide variety of               
              problems.
