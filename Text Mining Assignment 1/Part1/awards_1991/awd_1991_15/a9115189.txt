Abstract    :
                   This is a proposal to develop innovative curricular materials for         
              computer science.  The new curriculum will include the development of          
              introductory courses that will provide introductions to computer               
              science in contrast to beginning programming courses.  Laboratory              
              courses in experimental computer science will be developed to give the         
              students direct experience and immediate feedback in realistic                 
              systems.  Throughout, the courses will be focussed on a tight                  
              integration with the arts, including cooperative teaching and course           
              development.
