Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Objective of this study is to determine the magnitude of temporal              
              and spatial variations in the flux of ectraterrestrial Osmium in               
              pelagic clays over the reatively constant background levels.                   
              Coupled study of excess 230-Th and Os in recent pelagic clays                  
              will allow the determination of present day flux of Os in a site               
              in N.  Pacific.  The study will test if Os can be used as a                    
              tracer for calculating precise sedimentation rates and as a                    
              geochronologic tool.
