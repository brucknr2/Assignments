Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research in             
              applied mathematics between  two research groups:  Dr. Ralph                   
              Faudree and others at Memphis State University and Hao Li and                  
              others at the Laboratory for Information Research, University of               
              Paris (South).  The investigators will examine several problems                
              related to graph theory with particular emphasis on applications to            
              computer networks and fault tolerance.   They will focus on                    
              problems related to paths and cycles of special families of graphs             
              and plan to apply paths, connectivity and diameter problems to                 
              communication networks.  Algorithms will be developed to address               
              some of the applied problems.                                                  
                                                                                             
              The project brings together two research groups with overlapping               
              interests and expertise.  It will benefit from combining diverse               
              approaches to these problems and their mutual experience in both               
              graph theory and information science.  The research has important              
              applications to a number of complex areas in parallel computing,               
              such as mapping programs to parallel architectures, and code                   
              optimization.
