Abstract    :
                   The project is a collaborative effort between Clemson University,         
              Bowdoin College and University of Connecticut to investigate two               
              modifications to the first two years of the undergraduate computer             
              science curriculum.  The first modification broadens the focus of              
              these courses from primarily software development techniques to                
              consider the breadth of the computer science discipline.  The second           
              change blends the use of scheduled, structured laboratories with the           
              traditional lecture approach.                                                  
                                                                                             
              This approach follows the recent ACM '91 curriculum recommendations.           
              Project activities will include the development and class-testing of           
              lecture and text materials, and laboratory materials.  The laboratory          
              exercises will be developed for a variety of educational settings.             
              The results of the curriculum and materials development will be                
              disseminated through summer workshops, publications, and presentations         
              at professional meetings.
