Abstract    :
                   This grant will support a single investigator who will                    
              collaborate with Italian physicists.  He will analyze data from                
              one of the worlds largest and foremost particle detectors, the                 
              Colliding Detector Facility at Fermilab.  This award would                     
              provide funds for the investigator to travel to Padua, Italy to                
              use the computing facilities of his collaborators and to work                  
              closely with them.
