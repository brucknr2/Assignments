Abstract    :
                   Using methods developed by Soviet scientists, detailed                    
              calculations of mesic atomic and molecular scattering cross                    
              sections will be performed.  These results will allow a                        
              detailed analysis of experiments which have been performed as                  
              a result of the collaboration between William and Mary, PSI                    
              (Switzerland), IMEP (Austria) and Munich (Germany) and will be                 
              helpful in planning future experiments.
