Abstract    :
                   Dr. Francis Williamson is the Director of the Institute of                
              Arctic Biology at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks, which                   
              operates the Toolik Lake Field Station on Alaska's North Slope.                
              The Station is one of 17 NSF-supported Long-Term Ecological                    
              Research Sites, and it supports research projects conducted by                 
              University of Alaska faculty members and a wide array of visiting              
              investigators.  Dr. Williamson plans a number of improvements to               
              the Toolik Lake Field Station, including installation of fume                  
              hoods that will allow bio- and geochemical procedures,                         
              construction of a modular laboratory, an upgrade in the                        
              electrical systems used for computers and communication, and                   
              acquisition of equipment for environmental monitoring.                         
                   The research projects conducted at the Toolik Lake Field                  
              Station are rapidly increasing our understanding of the                        
              terrestrial and freshwater environments of the arctic tundra.                  
              The proposed improvements would correct current violations of                  
              safety regulations, and would increase the efficiency and                      
              productivity of the research projects based at the Station.                    
              Continued growth of research at the Station will require new                   
              instrumentation and improved lab facilities.
