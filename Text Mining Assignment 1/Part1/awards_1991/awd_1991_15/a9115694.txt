Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The objective of this research is twofold:  (1) the                       
              initiation and evolution of ice in convective clouds, and (2) the              
              growth of cloud drops owing to mixing.  These topics will be                   
              pursued using aircraft measurements taken during two field                     
              experiments in Hawaii and New Mexico.
