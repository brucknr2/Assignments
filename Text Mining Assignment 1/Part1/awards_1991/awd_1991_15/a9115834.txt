Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will investigate the effect of elevated temperature on            
              release of symbiotic animals (zooxanthellae) by tropical corals and            
              sea anemones.  In the field, studies will attempt to determine                 
              which taxa are susceptible to elevated temperature-induced release,            
              the time-temperature parameters which evoke release, and the mode              
              of release.   In the laboratory, studies will investigate the                  
              cellular mechanism by which elevated temperature evokes release of             
              zooxanthellae by host cells, using the sea anemone Aiptasia                    
              pulchella and selected reef corals.  Immunofluorescence and                    
              pharmacological agents will be used to characterize levels of free             
              intracellular calcium, integrity of selected skeletal proteins in              
              the cell, and synthesis of calcium-dependent adhesion proteins.                
              Individual host cells will be obtained by maceration.  Cells                   
              subjected to elevated temperature will be compared to controls at              
              ambient temperature.  The results will indicate in ecological terms            
              the potential impact of elevated temperature on coral reef                     
              anthozoans, and in cellular terms how elevated temperature causes              
              cell detachment, loss of zooxanthellae and destabilizaiton of                  
              marine symbioses which dominate tropical coral reefs.
