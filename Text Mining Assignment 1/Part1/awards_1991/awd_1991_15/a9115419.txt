Abstract    :
                   The project will develop a methodology to predict engineering             
              properties in injection molded parts.  The methodology will                    
              incorporate the application of connectionist learning systems,                 
              neural networks, to the processing of non-newtonian viscoelastic               
              polymeric materials.  The desired engineering properties in                    
              injection molded parts are strongly dependent upon the                         
              thermomechanical history which, in turn, is greatly influenced by              
              the processing parameters.  The relationships between part                     
              properties and thermomechanical history are complex and highly non-            
              linear, therefore the methodology to be developed will be based on             
              a back propagation algorithm that provides the means for training              
              networks with adaptive non-linear units.  The networks will be                 
              trained with the thermomechanical history of a simple plaque, from             
              the results of injection molding simulation programs, and the                  
              corresponding engineering properties.  The network relates                     
              thermomechanical history to the part properties through the                    
              weighted connections developed during training.  Thus, when                    
              thermomechanical histories from simulation results are known for               
              every location within any part, the corresponding properties can               
              be predicted.                                                                  
                  This methodology which is based on neural network computation              
              will provide part designers with the ability to predict engineering            
              properties in injection molded parts without molding and testing               
              actual components.
