Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Pelagic, feeding larvae of marine invertebrates invariably develop             
              from small eggs that contain little yolk.  In order to complete                
              development, larvae must feed on suspended food particles in the               
              surrounding seawater to supplement the reserves provided in the                
              egg.  In this project, the amount of material available for                    
              development to the initial feeding larval stage will be                        
              experimentally manipulated by altering the number of cells in the              
              early embryo.  The effect on initial larval morphology (size,                  
              shape, feeding structures) at the onset of feeding will be                     
              quantified.  Subsequent larval growth and development will be                  
              evaluated under limiting and nonlimiting food conditions.  This                
              research project seeks to elucidate the important functional and               
              developmental consequences of a change in the level of parental                
              investment.  The results apply to predictive models of life history            
              ecology and evolution in marine invertebrates and foraging by                  
              pelagic suspension feeders.
