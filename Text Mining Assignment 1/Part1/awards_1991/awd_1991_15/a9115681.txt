Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              This research will investigate the mechanisms of methane                       
              formation in the upper water column.  Dissolved methane                        
              profiles in the upper ocean are frequently characterized by a                  
              subsurface maximum.  This maximum commonly coincides with the                  
              pycnocline and methane concentrations there are supersaturated                 
              with respect to atmospheric equilibrium.  Methane peaks have                   
              been correlated with peaks in number of biological and chemical                
              parameters including ATP, chlorophyll, zooplankton and particle                
              concentrations.  This study will specifically investigate the                  
              role of zooplankton feeding in the production of methane.                      
              Zooplankton will be fed with radio labelled algae and measure                  
              labelled methane production.  Methods will also be developed to                
              feed zooplankton individual labeled compounds which may be                     
              specific precursors of methane.  The studies will lead to a                    
              better understanding of anaerobic processes in the oxic water                  
              column, provide information on digestive processes in                          
              zooplankton guts, and increase our knowledge of the cycling of                 
              methylamines and other C-1 compounds in seawater.
