Abstract    :
              The proposed research addresses inverse, ill-posed optimum                     
              design and parameter estimation problems in solidification                     
              processing.  The major contribution of the work would be to                    
              develop and experimentally verify mathematical and                             
              computational models that provide information for the optimum                  
              thermomechanical design and control of casting processes and                   
              utilize experimental data to accurately evaluate the                           
              thermomechanical material state during solidification.  This                   
              research will enhance our understanding and may potentially                    
              lead to better design and evaluation of solidification                         
              processing.
