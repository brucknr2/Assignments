Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This US-Czechoslovakia research project between Dr. Carol                      
              A. Venanzi of the New Jersey Institute of Technology and                       
              Dr. Tibor Kozar of the Biophysics Institute of the                             
              Institute of Experimental Physics, Kosice, Czechoslovakia                      
              will study the solvent effects on the conformation of a                        
              set of artificial enzymes.  Each group will bring to this                      
              collaboration its own expertise.  The Slovak investigators                     
              will apply the random walk molecular mechanics method to                       
              the conformational analysis of the artificial enzymes in                       
              the gas phase.  Results will be used to evaluate the                           
              technique in terms of the U.S. investigators' distance                         
              geometry and molecular dynamics results.  Both groups will                     
              study the solvent effects on molecular conformation; the                       
              Slovak investigators will use the continuum solvent model                      
              in conjunction with the random walk technique while the                        
              U.S. investigators will use discrete solvent molecular                         
              dynamics simulations.  The project should yield a thorough                     
              evaluation of methods for searching for the conformational                     
              potential energy surface of a molecule.                                        
                                                                                             
              This project in biochemistry fulfills the program                              
              objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling                        
              leading experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to                     
              combine complementary talents and pool resources in areas                      
              of strong mutual interest and competence.
