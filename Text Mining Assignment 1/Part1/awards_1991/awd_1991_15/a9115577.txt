Abstract    :
                   The focus of this project is to examine situations where                  
              finite- or infinite-dimensional parameters are to be estimated                 
              from i.i.d variables from a common distribution and to apply a                 
              generalized theory of adaptive and efficient estimation.                       
              Specific applications include inference for software reliability               
              and field testing, response functions under shape restrictions,                
              gene mapping procedures and the construction of similarity                     
              indices in molecular biology.                                                  
                   This project will take some very general theoretical results              
              and refine these for specialized complexities seen in particular               
              circumstances.
