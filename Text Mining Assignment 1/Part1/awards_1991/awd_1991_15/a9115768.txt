Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The goal of this project is to develop algorithms and prototype                
              software for solving large-scale mixed-integer programs and to                 
              develop application routines for solving problems that arise in                
              distribution, manufacturing, production scheduling and resource                
              allocation.  The motivation behind this research is the tremendous             
              demand for efficient and robust mixed-integer programming                      
              algorithms in the preceding domains.  A Mixed-Integer Optimizer                
              (Minto) system was developed by these researchers in prior                     
              projects.                                                                      
              The MINTO system allows a researcher to customize general mixed-               
              integer optimization code through application routines and                     
              concentrate on problem specifics rather that implementation details            
              of tools like linear programming.                                              
              The project will research methods to strengthen the capabilities               
              of MINTO.  It will also research the development of the application            
              routines for generic problems in distribution, scheduling,                     
              manufacturing and resource allocation.  Real application data will             
              be used to test the customized systems.
