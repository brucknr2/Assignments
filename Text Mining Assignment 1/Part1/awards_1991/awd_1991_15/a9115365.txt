Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The dynamics of the landward intrusion of the Kuroshio current into            
              the East China sea and the lateral mixing induced by such intrusion            
              will be studied with a high-resolution regional ocean circulation              
              primitive equation model. The specification of the open boundary               
              conditions and the treatement of the steep coastal topography are              
              the major challenges of this study.
