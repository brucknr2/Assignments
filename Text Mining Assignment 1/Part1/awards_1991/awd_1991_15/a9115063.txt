Abstract    :
              This proposal requests funds to hold a workshop on research needs              
              and opportunities in high temperature superconductivity.  The                  
              objectives of the workshop are threefold, to:  1) identify the                 
              barriers that may limit the developmental progress in high                     
              temperature superconductivity, 2) assess research areas that are               
              particularly ripe for important advances, and 3) investigate                   
              interagency collaborative research projects that utilize existing              
              large research facilities.
