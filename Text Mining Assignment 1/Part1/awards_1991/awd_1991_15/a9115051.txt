Abstract    :
              This Science in Developing Countries Award will                                
              support participation in the International College                             
              in Biophysics to be held in the International Center                           
              for Theoretical Physics, September 1992 in Trieste,                            
              Italy.  The meeting will cover methods and                                     
              experimental techniques in molecular biophysics,                               
              spectroscopy, x-ray crystallography and theoretical                            
              and computational methods in selected biophysical                              
              problems.  The U.S. organizer for this meeting is                              
              Dr. Horacio Farach of the University of South                                  
              Carolina. Participation will be extended to 6 U.S.                             
              lecturers and 8 researchers from Argentina, Brazil,                            
              Colombia, Chile, and Venezuela.                                                
                                                                                             
              The International Center for Theoretical Physics in                            
              Trieste was established to advance research in                                 
              developing countries. It supports research                                     
              activities in high energy and solid state physics,                             
              it provides a range of advanced courses and                                    
              conferences, and offers a full program of visits in                            
              all branches of physics and applied mathematics.  By                           
              getting together scientists from developing                                    
              countries to exchange information on current                                   
              research in biophysics, this award will serve to                               
              advance the goals of the Science in Developing                                 
              Countries program.
