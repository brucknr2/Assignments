Abstract    :
                   Professor Grundman will work on classifying Hilbert modular               
              threefolds from both the arithmetic and geometric viewpoints.  In              
              particular, she intends to study minimal models for Hilbert modular            
              threefolds with small plurigenera.                                             
                   This project falls into the general area of arithmetic                    
              geometry -a subject that blends two of the oldest areas of                     
              mathematics: number theory and geometry.  This combination has                 
              proved extraordinarily fruitful - having recently solved problems              
              that withstood generations.  Among its many consequences are new               
              error correcting codes.  Such codes are essential for both modern              
              computers (hard disks) and compact disks.
