Abstract    :
                   The Cedar Point Biological Station is operated by the                     
              University of Nebraska for grassland research.  The Station is                 
              adjacent to mixed prairie, sandhills prairie, sand-sage prairie,               
              and short grass prairie, and adjoins a reservoir on the North                  
              Platte River.  Several hybrid zones occur in this area of habitat              
              transition.  Dr. Anthony Joern, Director of the Station, plans                 
              construction of a research laboratory building in which                        
              biochemical analyses can be conducted.  This building would                    
              replace an 11-year old trailer, and would expand the analytical                
              activities at the site.                                                        
                   Cedar Point is well-supported by the University of Nebraska,              
              and the Station is facilitating research by a rapidly growing                  
              number of investigators.  The Station has established important                
              research collaborations with the NSF-supported Long-Term                       
              Ecological Research Site at Kansas State University, and the new               
              laboratory building is essential to the analyses involved in this              
              research.  Prairie-based research is important to agriculture and              
              to our understanding of global change and biodiversity.  The                   
              proposed lab construction will enhance research in both of these               
              areas.
