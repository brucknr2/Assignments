Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This two-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research in               
              mantle geochemistry between Paul McMillan and Charles Angell of                
              Arizona State University (ASU) and J.P. Coutoures of the Center                
              for High Temperature Physics in Orleans, France.  The objective                
              of their research is to investigate the structural properties of               
              aluminosilicate liquids and glasses, using a combination of high               
              temperature and solid state NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance)                   
              spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, Raman scattering, and MD                  
              (molecular dynamics) simulation.   The ASU group brings to this                
              collaboration experience in vibrational spectroscopy and Raman                 
              scattering of minerals, glasses and liquids.  This is complemented             
              by the French investigators' innovative research using ultra-high              
              temperature NMR in liquids.                                                    
                                                                                             
              Aluminosilicates are found in the Earth's upper mantle.                        
              Knowledge of the structure-property relationship of aluminosilicates           
              is essential to our understanding of dynamic processes and                     
              composition of the Earth and other planets.  These high pressure               
              and temperature studies will allow researchers to simulate the                 
              melting and transition process under conditions representative of              
              the Earth's upper mantle.
