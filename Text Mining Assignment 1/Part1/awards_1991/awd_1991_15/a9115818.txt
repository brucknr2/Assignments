Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project is an effort to use the different roles, half-lives               
              and properties of messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and ribosomal              
              (rRNA) to develop new indices of recent growth and physiological               
              status of larval Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and the copepod                   
              Calanus finmarchicus.  The concentration of rRNA and selected mRNAs            
              will be determined using nucleic acid hybridization probes                     
              developed for these species.  Larval Atlantic cod (G. morhua) and              
              C finmarchicus will be cultured under conditions producing widely              
              different growth and development rates.  The relations among mRNA              
              and rRNA levels, feeding conditions, growth and development will be            
              determined.
