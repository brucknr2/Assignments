Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Adult body size in marine zooplankton varies with season and                   
              latitude.  Larger body sizes are associated with colder seasons                
              and higher latitudes.  Since warmer environments and seasons also              
              tend to process less prey, the interaction of food and                         
              temperature may have important influences on body size.  Because               
              body size affects all aspects of an individual's ecology,                      
              explanations of body size must consider it a possible life                     
              history adaptation to a changing environments in ways that are                 
              not yet well understood.                                                       
                                                                                             
              This project will begin the development of a set of size-classified            
              population models, and use them to predict optimal body size                   
              patterns on the basis of maximization of individual fitness.  The              
              models will incorporate size-specific growth, mortality, and                   
              fecundity rates and the responses of those rates to temperature                
              and food.  Models will be parameterized based on information in                
              the literature.  The resulting models will be simulated in the                 
              context of seasonally varying temperature and food signals, to                 
              see how the optimal life history responses affect population                   
              dynamics.
