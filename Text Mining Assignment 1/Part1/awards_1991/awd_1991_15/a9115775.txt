Abstract    :
                   This project consists of a series of three workshops to be                
              held in successive summers for approximately twenty women                      
              researchers in statistics and probability who have received their              
              doctorate degree within the five years prior to the workshop                   
              year.  The first workshop is scheduled for August 8-9, 1992 and                
              would immediately precede the Joint Annual Meetings of the                     
              American Statistical Association, regions of the Biometric                     
              Society, and the Institute of Mathematical Statistics to be held               
              from August 9-13, 1992 in Boston, Massachusetts.  The second                   
              workshop would likely be scheduled for August 7-8, 1993 and would              
              precede the Joint Annual Meetings of the American Statistical                  
              Association, regions of the Biometric Society, and the Institute               
              of Mathematical Statistics to be held from August 8-12, 1993 in                
              San Francisco, California.  The third workshop is tentatively                  
              scheduled for August 1994 and would be held either prior to the                
              Joint Annual Meetings of the American Statistical Association and              
              regions of the Biometric Society, tentatively planned to be held               
              in Toronto, Canada or prior to the Third World Congress to be                  
              held at a location in the U.S. yet to be announced.  The director              
              of the project is Professor Lynne Billard of the University of                 
              Georgia.                                                                       
                   The purpose of the workshops will be to increase and foster               
              the research activity of the participants.  It is hoped that the               
              participants will use the workshop and the resulting professional              
              contacts to enhance their research and decrease their isolation.
