Abstract    :
                   Dr. John Ogden is Director of the Florida Institute of                    
              Oceanography, and currently serves as co-chair of the Steering                 
              Committee of the Caribbean Coastal Marine Productivity Program                 
              (CARICOMP), a consortium of more than 30 marine labs located in                
              more than 20 Caribbean countries.  The consortium was established              
              in 1985 and has received NSF and UNESCO support for workshops that             
              initiated planning for a basin-wide information network dedicated              
              to collecting and maintaining standardized long-term environmental             
              (oceanographic, meteorologic, and ecosystem) observations.  A Data             
              Management Center will be established with UNESCO support at the               
              University of the West Indies, Kingston, to operate the network.               
              Dr. Ogden proposes initiation of the data network by installing                
              personal computers, submersible water quality data loggers, remote             
              automated weather stations, and networking hardware and software               
              at five representative marine labs, located in Venezuela, the                  
              Yucatan Peninsula, Jamaica, St. Lucia, and Barbados.                           
                   The CARICOMP network will facilitate pure and applied research            
              into the tropical ecosystems of the coastal zone (reefs, mangrove              
              wetlands, seagrass meadows).  The proposed effort will provide                 
              important benefits to research on global change and the impacts of             
              society and economic development on tropical coastal zones.
