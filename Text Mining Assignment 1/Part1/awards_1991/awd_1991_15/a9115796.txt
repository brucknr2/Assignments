Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              The objective of this U.S.-Poland research project between Dr.                 
              Peter A. Kollman of the School of Pharmacy, University of                      
              California, San Francisco Center, and Dr. Piotr Cieplak of the                 
              University of Warsaw, Poland, is to carry out theoretical                      
              calculations to design peptide analogs that have the potential to be           
              excellent inhibitors of the proteins HIV protease, thermolysin and             
              elastase.  The successful design of an inhibitor for this enzyme,              
              should it prove of therapeutic value, could be used against the                
              AIDS virus.  The same type of design could be transferred to the               
              inhibitor of other aspartyl proteases such as renin, which would               
              provide therapy against hypertension.  Selective inhibition of serine          
              proteases such as human leucocyte elastase as a potential drug                 
              against emphysema or other such degenerative diseases might be                 
              achieved using the same principles.                                            
                                                                                             
              This project in biophysics fulfills the program objective of                   
              advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the              
              United States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary                      
              talents and pool resources in areas of strong mutual interest and              
              competence.
