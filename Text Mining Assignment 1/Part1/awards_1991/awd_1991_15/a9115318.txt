Abstract    :
                   Complex analysis has developed vigorously in this century.                
              In particular, there has been great progress in the theory of                  
              functions of several complex variables; this progress has come                 
              about as a result of efforts made in many other important areas                
              of mathematics.  Three areas in particular have had a profound                 
              influence on the development of several complex variables.  These              
              are the methods of partial differential equations, the methods of              
              complex differential geometry, and the methods of algebraic                    
              geometry.  This conference will focus on stimulating more                      
              interaction among the diverse branches of the subject and                      
              emphasizing ideas common to all the above areas.                               
                   This project will support a one-week Conference on Several                
              Complex Variables to be held at Princeton University from March                
              16-20, 1992.  This conference will be held in honor of R. C.                   
              Gunning and J. J. Kohn.  In addition to the ten principal                      
              speakers who will give hour long addresses, there will be                      
              opportunities for shorter talks and more informal discussions.  A              
              refereed proceedings of the conference is being planned for                    
              publication.
