Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program                 
              along with the Instrumentation and Instrumentation Development                 
              Program of the Division of Instrumentation and Resources will                  
              help the Department of Chemistry at Washington State University                
              acquire a 300 MHz NMR Spectrometer.  The projects described by                 
              the major users include development of novel synthetic methods                 
              such as the use of boronic esters in asymmetric synthesis, and                 
              the use of metal-halogen exchange reactions in chiral synthesis                
              of novel macrocycles; the synthesis of altered nucleotide bases                
              and their incorporation into DNA; the investigation of electron                
              transfer in organometallic complexes; the synthesis of                         
              isotopically enriched terpenoids for biosynthetic studies; the                 
              synthesis of potential metabolites for ligin biosynthesis; and                 
              the synthesis of isotopically enriched substrates for                          
              mechanistic studies of enzymes of aromatic amino acid                          
              biosynthesis.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              %%%                                                                            
                                                                                             
              Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy is the most                      
              powerful tool available to the chemist for the elucidation of                  
              the structure of molecules.  It is used to identify unknown                    
              substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within                 
              molecules and to study the dynamics of interactions between                    
              molecules in solution.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR                         
              spectroscopy is essential to chemists who are carrying out                     
              frontier research.  The results from these NMR studies are                     
              useful in areas such as polymers and catalysis, and in biology.
