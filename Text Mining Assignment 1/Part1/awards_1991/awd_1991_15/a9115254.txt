Abstract    :
                   This is a collaborative proposal between Temple University,               
              Villanova University, Drexel University and Millersville University to         
              design and prototype an AI repository consisting of a variety of               
              educational materials and computing environments.  The AI repository,          
              to be maintained and supported by Temple University, will be used by           
              students for software projects and for independent personal study in           
              AI laboratories associated with computer science courses.
