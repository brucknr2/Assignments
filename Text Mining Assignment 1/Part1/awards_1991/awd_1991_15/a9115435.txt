Abstract    :
                   Recent national studies have identified serious deficiencies              
              in mechanical tolerancing and metrology standards and practices,               
              and in the teaching of these in universities, training institutes,             
              and industry.  The central problem underlying all of these                     
              deficiencies is the lack of proper scientific foundations for                  
              mechanical tolerancing.  In essence, tolerancing and metrology                 
              evolved from shop-floor practice, and are taught and applied as                
              collections of special-case techniques.                                        
                   This project pursues four related lines of research to improve            
              this situation:  (1) development of a semi-formal mathematical                 
              codification for the main principles of the ANSI Y14.5 tolerancing             
              standard, initially in the form of a monograph and/or course notes             
              for engineering students; (2) extension of the codification with               
              mathematical and computational techniques for analyzing the                    
              accumulation of geometric tolerances (i.e., generalization of one-             
              dimension tolerance stacking).  Such techniques are important in               
              design for assembly;  (3) linking of the codification to metrology             
              practices, with selective research on open issues in dimensional               
              and surface modeling; and (4) exploratory research in functional               
              tolerancing (i.e., control of the effects of spatial variability               
              on the performance of designed artifacts).
