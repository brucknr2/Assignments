Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A feasibility study will be conducted to determine whether UV                  
              excimer lasers can be used to clean aluminum-coated mirror samples             
              that have been contaminated by typical contaminants found on                   
              astronomical mirrors.  Specific tasks for this program are listed              
              below.                                                                         
                                                                                             
              A laser cleaning laboratory for cleaning the mirror samples and                
              measuring the effectiveness of the technique shall be set up.                  
                                                                                             
              Aluminum-coated mirror samples shall be artificially contaminated              
              with contaminants typically found around astronomical mirrors (e.g.            
              sand dust from Manuna Kea and Arizona) and UV laser cleaned.  The              
              cleaning parameters (e.g. laser fluence, number of shots per site)             
              shall be varied in order to determine the optimum cleaning                     
              procedure.  The mirror reflectivity shall be measured before                   
              contamination, after contamination, and after laser cleaning.                  
                                                                                             
              Aluminum-coated mirror samples shall be distributed to selected                
              astronomical observatories to be exposed to the same contaminants              
              that the primary mirror experiences.  These mirror samples shall               
              be returned for laser cleaning tests.  The reflectivity of the                 
              mirror samples shall be measured before shipping to the                        
              observatories, after receiving the contaminated mirror samples,                
              and after laser cleaning.
