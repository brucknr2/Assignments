Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                                                                                            
              The US Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (US JGOFS) seeks "to                      
              understand the processes governing the production and fate of                  
              biogenic material in the sea well enough to predict their                      
              influences on, and responses to global scale perturbations."                   
              The program proposes to do this by "identifying and quantifying                
              the physical, chemical and biological processes controlling                    
              biogeochemical cycling in the ocean, and their interaction with                
              the global atmosphere."  The implicit assumption of this                       
              strategy for achieving a predictive capability is that the                     
              process and interactions quantified today respond linearly to                  
              global scale perturbations and that knowledge of the present                   
              biogeochemical system dynamics will, therefore, allow one to                   
              predict response to global perturbations with accuracy.  This is               
              a fundamental assumption and is the keystone of the JGOFS                      
              strategy for predictive capability.  The scientific justification              
              for this assumption has never been stated and is the purpose of                
              this research.
