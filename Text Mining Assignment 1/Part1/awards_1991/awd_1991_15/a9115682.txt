Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This three-year award supports cooperative research in atomic and              
              molecular physics between D.M. Ceperley of the University of                   
              Illinois and Bernard Bermu of the Pierre and Marie Curie                       
              University, Paris, France, the investigators propose to develop                
              quantum Monte Carlo methods for the properties of hydrogenic                   
              plasmas at relatively high temperatures.  Plasmas are found in                 
              nature under different conditions.  There are interstellar plasmas,            
              and the plasmas in the interiors of planets and stars.  Before                 
              classifying plasmas, their ionization state must be determined.  The           
              investigators will calculate the ionization state of hydrogenic                
              plasmas under conditions were quantum effects, thermal excitations             
              and electronic correlation are simultaneously important.                       
                                                                                             
              This project will benefit form the complementary expertise of the              
              U.S. investigator in quantum Monte Carlo techniques and the                    
              French investigator in high temperature plasmas and transport                  
              processes.  Access to high speed computers in the countries will               
              contribute significantly to this joint effort.  The results will be of         
              general interest to researchers in dense plasma physics and will               
              advance our understanding of planetary and stellar structure.
