Abstract    :
              Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution will analyze and                          
              publish data that has been collected over a three year                         
              period on an NSF project to improve meteorological                             
              measurements from ships and buoys.  The goal of this WOCE                      
              long-lead time development program was to improve the                          
              accuracy, reliability and availability of meteorological                       
              and air-sea flux measurements made over extended time                          
              periods from ships and buoys.  A major focus of the program                    
              was to improve the sensors used for these measurements,                        
              evaluate their accuracy, and reduce errors in making those                     
              measurements.  Improved sensors have resulted for                              
              barometric pressure, precipitation, humidity, incoming                         
              longwave radiation, air temperature, sea temperature and                       
              wind speed and direction.  Analyzing and publishing this                       
              long-term sensor data will provide the research community                      
              with a full description of sensor performance for various                      
              models available for use at sea.  Additionally, IMET system                    
              software and hardware will be documented for purposes of                       
              technology transfer to commercial vendors and the research                     
              community.
