Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research project will use national longitudinal data sets                 
              of scientists and engineers between 1982 and 1989,                             
              supplemented with newly collected and constructed data                         
              measures of occupational depreciation and transferability of                   
              skills, to generate new estimates of occupational exit and                     
              reentry of scientists and engineers.  The research will draw                   
              on existing theoretical models of occupational choice and                      
              occupational switching to develop econometric models of exit                   
              and reentry.  Empirical techniques such as hazard rate and                     
              competing risks models will be used to estimate parameters of                  
              the models that will be used to refine projections of supply                   
              of scientists and engineers.
