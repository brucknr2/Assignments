Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Fundamental research directed toward understanding both the                    
              chemical and micro-structural features of the oxidation of                     
              multicomponent materials systems(SiGe and SiC) using high pressure             
              techniques is being carried out.  The high pressure technique                  
              allows the synthesis of chemically metastable materials that have              
              no natural analogs, and offers the ability to assess the effect of             
              reaction rates under isothermal conditions on the development of               
              interface morphology.

              This research is expected to provide fundamental understanding of              
              multicomponent materials systems important to the electronics                  
              field.  The understanding gained will be helpful to semiconductor              
              device design and fabrication.  The results will be of importance              
              in a general way to the technology of large scale, high speed                  
              integrated electronic circuits.
