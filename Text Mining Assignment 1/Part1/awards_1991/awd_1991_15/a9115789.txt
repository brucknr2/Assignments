Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The long-term goals of this research program are to understand how             
              sensory information is coded and processed in the brain and how                
              neural networks have been modified during evolution to produce new             
              behaviors.  More specifically, a primary objective is to understand            
              the functional significance of "laminar" organization in the brain,            
              i.e. many layers of cells.  The human cortex is an example of such             
              laminar organization.  To learn whether neurons of particular                  
              layers have different functional roles, their selectivities for                
              specific sensory information and morphology must be determined.                
                                                                                             
              Electric fish are well-suited for obtaining such information since             
              behavioral studies have already provided insights into this sensory            
              system and electric signals are easily produced in the laboratory.             
              Electrosensory information processing occurs within laminated                  
              regions of their brains and microelectrodes can be inserted into               
              neurons within these layers.  Such information will have general               
              significance to understanding how sensory information is processed             
              in laminated structures within more complex brains, as well.
