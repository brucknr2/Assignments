Abstract    :
              The advanced Computing Laboratory in the Computer Science                      
              Department at the University of Tennessee has access to a number               
              of new architecture high performance computers.  This award is to              
              upgrade the facility by the addition of a mixed mode Single                    
              Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD)/Multiple Instruction Multiple                 
              Data (MIMD) computer, increasing the number of processors in a                 
              shared memory MIMD computer, and providing partial support for a               
              technician.  The research supported by these computers include                 
              the design and development of portable, efficient numerical                    
              linear algebra algorithms; the development of non-numeric                      
              algorithms for parallel architectures; the development of                      
              parallel algorithms for genome sequencing; and the development of              
              parallel discrete optimization algorithms using the genetic                    
              algorithm method.
