Abstract    :
                   Dr. John Fitzpatrick is the Director of the Archbold                      
              Biological Station in south-central Florida.  Dr. Fitzpatrick                  
              requests support for acquisition of a Geographic Information                   
              System for spatial research on diverse habitats and scales of                  
              study.  This system would allow investigators to superimpose                   
              their data on diverse base-maps, such as maps of soil type,                    
              vegetation, and recency of fire disturbance.                                   
                   The addition of a Geographic Information System to the                    
              facilities at the Archbold Biological Station will generate new                
              and innovative research programs.  Examples of these studies are               
              habitat choice by bird populations, distribution and impact of                 
              lightning-induced wildfires, spatial distribution of rare plant                
              species, conservation and land management of patchy habitats, and              
              co-existence of cattle ranching and native habitats.  This                     
              facility will significantly enhance the capabilities of this                   
              productive field station.
