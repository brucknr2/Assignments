Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              A high resolution time-series study of particulate fluxes using                
              a new time-series MULTITRAP as part of the Bermuda U.S. JGOFS                  
              research program will be implemented.  Development of this trap                
              was funded through the NSF as part of the U.S. JGOFS program and               
              represents an effort to acquire very high resolution time-series               
              samples of the downward flux of particles in surface (<300m)                   
              waters.  The technology represents a combination of the proven                 
              Honjo time-series rotator mechanism and the MULTITRAP multiple                 
              collector PIT (Particle Interceptor Trap) used in the VERTEX                   
              (Vertical Transfer and Exchange), RACER (Research on Antarctic                 
              Ecosystem Rates), ADIOS (Asian Dust Input to the Oceanic System),              
              and NABE (JGOFS North Atlantic Bloom Experiment) Programs, and                 
              which is now used at the JGOFS time-series stations in Bermuda                 
              (BATS, Bermuda Atlantic Time-Series) and Hawaii (HOTS, Hawaii                  
              Ocean Time-Series).  The new technology was developed to address               
              shortcomings inherent in earlier designs, and has been                         
              successfully field tested.  The project will deploy this trap in               
              a study aimed at determining the scales of variability occurring               
              in the downward flux of total mass, carbon and nitrogen, their                 
              links to surface productivity, and the temporal changes in both                
              export production and f ratio.
