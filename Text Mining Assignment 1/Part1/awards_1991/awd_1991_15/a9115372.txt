Abstract    :
              The proposal is to investigate methods for building self-timed                 
              circuit modules in a gallium arsenide (GaAs) process that are                  
              suitable for assembling into larger systems that also exhibit self-            
              timed behavior.  Gallium arsenide holds great promise for                      
              implementing extremely high performance integrated circuits but                
              this speed also makes system design difficult.  Systems designed               
              using these modules can be faster, more robust, and easier to                  
              design than their globally clocked counterparts.  Since self-timed             
              techniques also allow subsystems of widely varying speeds to work              
              together, such systems may be improved incrementally by directly               
              replacing slower CMOS parts with faster GaAs parts.                            
                                                                                             
              As a first step towards the goal of building fast self-timed GaAs              
              systems a set of circuit modules are built with the PPL tool suite             
              developed at the University of Utah.  PPL can hide many of the                 
              complicated problems with GaAs circuit design and allow the                    
              designer to focus on the functionality of the system.  Combined                
              with the benefits self-timing this should provide an attractive                
              methodology for designing  extremely fast systems and exploring                
              aspects of concurrent systems in gallium arsenide.
