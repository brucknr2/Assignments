Abstract    :
                   This award partially supports a study by the Board of                     
              Mathematical Sciences of the National Research Council to: (1)                 
              identify and describe areas where the mathematical sciences have               
              significantly aided materials research; (2) identify areas of the              
              mathematical sciences in which increased research would accelerate             
              progress in materials sciences; (3) identify obstacles, if any, to             
              increased collaborative research; and (4) make recommendations for             
              facilitating collaborative work, including recommendations on how              
              to attract students and young investigators to this area.                      
              Particular attention will be paid to the areas of materials                    
              synthesis and processing.  An interdisciplinary committee of the               
              Board of Mathematical Sciences will perform the study.  In addition            
              to National Science Foundation support, this project will be                   
              supported by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research and the               
              Army Research Office.
