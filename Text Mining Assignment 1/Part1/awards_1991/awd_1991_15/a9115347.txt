Abstract    :
              In this project, the PI will continue analysis and complete the                
              publication of data from eight oceanographic cruises carried out               
              by the PI in collaboration with the Peoples' Republic of China on              
              a Chinese vessel from 1986 through 1990.  Several aspects of the               
              upper and deep ocean circulation in the Western Pacific will be                
              addressed, including bifurcation of the North Equatorial Current,              
              Indonesian inflow, subsurface currents near Papua New Guinea, and              
              Intermediate Water circulation.
