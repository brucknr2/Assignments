Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program                 
              will help the Department of Chemistry at the University of                     
              California at Berkeley acquire an upgrade of a 250 MHz NMR                     
              spectrometer which will be used in research investigations in                  
              the following areas of chemistry:  1) studies in the                           
              shikimate-chorismate pathway, 2) design and synthesis of                       
              peptide mimics, 3) the chemical enzymatic synthesis of natural                 
              products and cell-surface glycoconjugates, 4) total synthesis                  
              of natural products and the development of organic synthesis                   
              methodology and 5) catalytic antibodies.                                       
              Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy is the most                      
              powerful tool available to the chemist for the elucidation of                  
              the structure of molecules.  It is used to identify unknown                    
              substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within                 
              molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between                   
              molecules in solution.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR                         
              spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out                     
              frontier research.  The results from these NMR studies are                     
              useful in areas such as polymers and catalysis, and in biology.
