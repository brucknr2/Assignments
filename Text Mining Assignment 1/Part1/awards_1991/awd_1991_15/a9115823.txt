Abstract    :
              This is a proposal for instrumentation t perform                               
              measurements of fluorescent lifetimes using both the                           
              established technique single photon counting (SPU) and a new                   
              and novel method which we termed 'Time-Resolved Fluorescence                   
              Lifetime Imaging' (TRFLI).  The system consists of a                           
              Ultrafast CW Nd: YAG pumped dye laser and a mode-locker,                       
              second and third harmonic generator units; an inverted epi-                    
              fluorescence microscope with infinity-corrected optic;                         
              microchannel-plate photomultipler tube; high-speed, gated                      
              image intensifier coupled fiberoptically to an integrating                     
              CCD camera, with necessary control units; digital delay                        
              pulse generator, delay units,  time-to-amplitude converter                     
              with bias amplifier and multichannel analyzer; and on-stage                    
              specimen controllers for temperature and atmospheric gases                     
              (  O 2 & CO2).  The requested laser has a minimum 1.3 ps                       
              pulse width, a repetition rate of  76 MHz and usable                           
              excitation wavelengths from 350-846 nm.                                        
                                                                                             
              Primary uses of this system will be to measure fluorescent                     
              lifetimes in living cells of fluorophores or fluorophore                       
              conjugated cellular components on the living cells.  This                      
              information will then be used to determine with temporal and                   
              spatial resolution molecular interactions amongst cellular                     
              constituents, using resonance energy transfer and time                         
              resolved emission spectra, monitor membrane lipid order                        
              (fluidity) using time resolved emission anisotropy,                            
              detection of pathogenic organisms in clinical specimens and                    
              measurement of cytosolic free Ca2+ using Fura-2, Fluo-3, or                    
              Rhod-2 lifetime analysis.  The use of Fluo-3 or Rhod-2  will                   
              also allow the use of caged compounds and laser scanning                       
              confocal microscopy.  The TRFLI System will be a unique                        
              instrument integrating state-of-the-art advances in optical                    
              microscopy, low-light video detection and 2-dimensional                        
              lifetime image analysis and which does not exit anywhere                       
              else in the country.
