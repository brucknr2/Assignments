Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research                
              in civil engineering between Reidar Bjorhovde of the University                
              of Pittsburgh and Andre Colson of the Ecole Normale Superieure                 
              de Cachan, France.  The project addresses a central issue in the               
              analysis and design of steel structures; specifically, the reliability         
              of semi-rigid connections of structural frames.  The investigators             
              will perform studies on a variety of structures from simple low-               
              rise to multistory high-rise buildings to industrial structures.  The          
              objective is to establish criteria for determining the behavior of a           
              variety of framework connections.  They will develop models                    
              which reflect the random nature of connection elements.  Dr.                   
              Bjorhovde brings to this collaboration significant experience in               
              steel research and probabilistic methods of analysis and design.               
              This is complemented by the French investigator's expertise in                 
              deterministic studies on the strength and behavior of steel                    
              structures for semi-rigid connectors.                                          
                                                                                             
              This research will provide complete data and a new methodology                 
              for the deterministic and probabilistic behavior of semi-rigid                 
              connections.  The results could foster the use of semi-rigid                   
              connections by designers in the United States and lead to cost-                
              effective designs and improved safety of steel structures.
