Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research in             
              experimental physical chemistry between Tomas Baer of the                      
              University of North Carolina and Paul Marie Guyon of the                       
              University of Paris (South).  The primary objective of the project is          
              to investigate the mechanism for the formation of high-lying                   
              electronic states in gases by producing low-energy electrons.  The             
              experimental approach is based on the use of both pulsed                       
              synchrotron radiation as a light source and laser-based techniques.            
              The project will benefit significantly from access to unique                   
              facilities in France.  Dr. Guyon and his group will conduct the                
              initial electron and ion timing experiments on the Orsay                       
              synchrotron.  The dispersed light from the synchrotron is                      
              advantageous for scanning molecules across a wide range of energy              
              levels.  This is complemented by subsequent experiments at the                 
              University of North Carolina using laser light in more limited                 
              energy regions.  This combined effort will result in improved                  
              experimental techniques for the physical and chemical analysis of              
              gases.
