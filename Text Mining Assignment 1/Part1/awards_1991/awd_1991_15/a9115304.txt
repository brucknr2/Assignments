Abstract    :
              Volatiles in Submarine Magmas:  An Experimental Study                           
                                                                                            
              This is a solid proposal that deserves to be funded.  It is                    
              astonishing that at present we don not have a experimentally-based             
              and theoretically quasi-justified model for H2O-CO2 - MOR melt at              
              1000 to 1400 degree C and 1 to 10K bar.  These PI's seem committed             
              to amassing the relevant data and there is good previous work on               
              both PI's.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              The only concern I have is the pricetag|  Nearly $0.4M is a lot of             
              $...  That is about $120K per year.  Since these data are so                   
              relevant to Earth Sciences, in general, I wonder if some EAR cost-             
              sharing could be arranged?                                                     
                                                                                             
              I don't see much "fat" in the budget, unless the scope of the                  
              project was reduced, for example, by cutting out the kinetic stuff             
              and focusing on T-P-fo2-fh2o-fco2-melt Bulk Comp.
