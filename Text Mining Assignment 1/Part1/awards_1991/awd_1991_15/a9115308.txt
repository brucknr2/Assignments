Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The kinetics of crystallization are, in general, controlled by two             
              competitive phenomena, the thermodynamic driving force, which                  
              forces the crystal/noncrystal interface forward, and the rate at               
              which the heat of fusion and any unincorporable components can flow            
              away from that interface.  Over a wide range of conditions, this               
              competition causes the interface to assume intricate patterns.  The            
              aim of the proposed work is to develop an experimental base and a              
              theoretical framework by which such pattern formation in polymer               
              systems can be understood.  This work will be directed at                      
              spherulitic crystallization in polymer blends and at the                       
              development of microstructure in melt-spun fibers.                             
                                                                                             
              An experimental program for quiescent crystallization will be                  
              carried out.  In this, both constrained (by forced movement through            
              a temperature gradient) and unconstrained spherulite-like growth               
              will be studied.  In both cases, microstructural parameters will be            
              measured and compared to model predictions.  Likewise, a study will            
              be made of the temperature and crystallite radius of oriented                  
              polymer fibers crystallized by running them through a temperature              
              gradient.  These will be compared to those of a model developed by             
              the principal investigator.  It is expected that the work will also            
              extend existing theory for pattern development in polymers.
