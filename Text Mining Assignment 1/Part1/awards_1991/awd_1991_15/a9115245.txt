Abstract    :
                   The Duke University Marine Lab at Beaufort, North Carolina,               
              is one of the country's most active centers for marine research                
              and for graduate training in oceanography.  The University has                 
              recently commissioned the Research Vessel Susan Hudson, a 57' ship             
              for coastal ocean research.  Dr. Joseph Ramus, Director of the Duke            
              University Marine Lab, has requested shipboard equipment for water             
              sampling and for collecting plankton and bottom samples.  The                  
              University also proposes to renovate the pier and dockside                     
              electrical facilities for the new research vessel.                             
                   The proposed instrumentation and facilities renovation will               
              have an immediate impact on the many resident and visiting students            
              and researchers at the Duke University Marine Lab.  The R/V Hudson             
              will begin her active career earlier and with more immediate                   
              capabilities for research and teaching.  The proposed improvements             
              will convey significant benefits to a wide audience of biologists              
              and oceanographers.
