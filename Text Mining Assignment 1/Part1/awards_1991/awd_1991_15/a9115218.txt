Abstract    :
              This doctoral dissertation research project is a comparative study             
              of archaeological assemblages from 30 Middle and Early Paleolithic             
              sites in Siberia dating between 50,000 and 20,000 years ago. These             
              sites are essential to an understanding of the origins, adaptations            
              and dispersal of modern humans in Eurasia. This material is also               
              central to an understanding of the origins of culture in the New               
              World. Combined with a re-evaluation of geomorphic and                         
              stratigraphic contexts of sites, organic samples will be collected             
              for radiocarbon datings using accelerator mass spectrometry.                   
              Against this chronological background, lithic artifacts from                   
              Siberian sites will be  reexamined and analyzed.
