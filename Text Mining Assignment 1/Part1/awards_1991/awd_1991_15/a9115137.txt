Abstract    :
              The recent construction of radio millimeter wavelengths has                    
              permitted the imaging of outflows from stars in advanced stages of             
              stellar evolution in lines of various molecules.  This                         
              accomplishment permits the kinematics of these outflows to be                  
              studied, leading to an understanding of how nonspherical planetary             
              nebulae form, as well as the chemical interactions between gas and             
              dust particles as a function of distance.  The Principal                       
              Investigator (PI) will use the "BIMA" radio array at Hat Creek,                
              California and the new Arizona-German millimeter-wave telescope on             
              Mt. Graham to study these questions.  These studies are expected               
              to lead to a better understanding of why about one half the                    
              planetary nebulae around these stars are significantly nonspherical            
              and to lead to a better understanding of the chemistry of                      
              interstellar grains.  The latter question is of importance to the              
              thermodynamic conditions of interstellar gas and ultimately to the             
              condensation of new generations of stars.//
