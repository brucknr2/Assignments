Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This study will use enzymatic indicators of metabolic function and             
              direct measurements of respiratory rates to describe the pattern of            
              metabolic potentials of midwater animals as a function of depth of             
              occurrence, the presence of mid-depth oxygen minima, and body size.            
              Preliminary data suggest that previous generalizations based on                
              physiologically complex, visually-orienting fishes and crustaceans             
              are not generally applicable to micronekton and zooplankton of                 
              other taxa which have largely been ignored in previous studies.                
              This study will allow investigation of a broader range of                      
              animals than previously possible, especially those which are more              
              fragile in structure, enabling us to extend the description of the             
              patterns of variation in metabolic potential to all of the major               
              midwater groups (with emphasis on chaetognaths, medusae, worms and             
              molluscs and more superficial work on ctenophores and                          
              siphonophores).  The research is directed at achieving a                       
              synthesis of the carbon fluxes through this ecosystem.  This                   
              application of the research will be tested by collecting data on               
              the biomass of the major groups of midwater animals in a 4100 m                
              California Current water column and using the metabolic data to                
              estimate respiratory carbon flux due to zooplankton and micronekton            
              in this community.
