Abstract    :
                   The purpose of this conference is to provide a forum for an               
              exchange of ideas in the Division of Design and Manufacturing                  
              Systems.  The conference ensures that the individual researchers               
              are informed about the present ongoing activities of their                     
              colleagues.  Thus, an elimination of duplication of their efforts              
              may be achieved and a degree of cooperation may result.  An overall            
              improvement of efficiency of the Division would be expected.  In               
              addition, the conference program organization allows for ample time            
              to discuss manufacturing research in detail with the collective                
              research community at the meeting, with feedback and input from the            
              National Science Foundation.  Finally, personal contacts with the              
              researchers in the Division should contribute to clarifying many               
              current problems in their work.                                                
                   Principal Investigators attending the conference usually gain             
              a one to two year lead on the information disseminated; this is                
              the usual time frame for materials presented at the conference to              
              be published in journals and other literature.
