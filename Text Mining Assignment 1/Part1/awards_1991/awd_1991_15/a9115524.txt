Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This U.S.-Bulgaria research project between Dr.                                
              James Edward Mark of the University of Cincinnati                              
              and Dr. Stoyko Faktrov of the Laboratory on                                    
              Polymers, University of Sofia, Bulgaria, will                                  
              synthesize and investigate model thermoplastic                                 
              elastomers based on poly-(etheresters) and                                     
              poly(etheresteramides) with various chemical                                   
              sequences (i.e., various block lengths), to                                    
              answer important questions regarding their                                     
              structure as well as to improve or even maximize                               
              their properties.  The moduli and ultimate                                     
              properties of these materials are of critical                                  
              importance with regard to their functioning as                                 
              high-performance fibers and films.                                             
                                                                                             
              This project in chemistry fulfills the program                                 
              objective of advancing scientific knowledge by                                 
              enabling leading experts in the United States and                              
              Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents                                
              and pool resources in areas of strong mutual                                   
              interest and competence.
