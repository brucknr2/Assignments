Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project involves the dissertation research of a graduate                  
              student in cognitive anthropology from the University of                       
              California-San Diego.  The project will study how fishermen from               
              a rural Swedish village coordinate their work activities given a               
              set of constraints from their social life, cultural tradition,                 
              human cognition and the physical environment.  Working from                    
              videotapes of activity in fishing boat settings, transcripts will              
              be produced that make explicit the representations used by actors              
              to satisfy task constraints with the resources at hand.  The                   
              transcription process involves a translation of behavioral data                
              into a language that reveals the task-relevant representations                 
              that are communicated, acted upon, or otherwise used to enable                 
              coordination.  The data will test propositions about the                       
              relationships between cognitive action, cultural resources, and                
              social processes.                                                              
                                                                                             
              This research is important because understanding how task groups               
              solve problems and coordinate action can help society design                   
              equipment and processes to minimize error and improve efficiency.              
              The relevance to important work activities, such as air traffic                
              controllers, and navigation teams, is clear.
