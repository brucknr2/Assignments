Abstract    :
                   The H. J. Andrews Experimental Forest is an                               
              interdisciplinary research site operated by Oregon State                       
              University, and actively used by collaborating researchers from                
              OSU, the University of Washington, the U. S. Forest Service, the               
              U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, USGS, and other                          
              universities.  The site is located in Willamette National Forest,              
              and is one of 17 NSF-supported Long-Term Ecological Research                   
              Sites and the venue for an NSF Research Experience for                         
              Undergraduates Site.  The PI requests support for a CNS analyzer,              
              a soil/tissue sample mill, and a microcomputer for data                        
              acquisition.  These instruments would be available to resident                 
              and visiting investigators in the Station's Plant/Soil Analysis                
              Lab.                                                                           
                   The proposed instrument acquisition would add sulfur                      
              analysis to the Lab's capabilities, increase the number of                     
              analyses performed at the Station, decrease the size of the                    
              samples that could be analyzed, and decrease the per sample cost               
              of chemical analysis.  These analyses are critical to the studies              
              of wood decomposition and chemical flux through ecosystems that                
              are underway at the Forest.  Acquisition of this instrument will               
              have a significant beneficial impact on many current and future                
              research projects.
