Abstract    :
                   Dr. William Bowman is Director of the University of                       
              Colorado's Mountain Research Station, located at 2900 meters                   
              elevation in the Front Range of the Rockies near the Continental               
              Divide.  The Niwot Ridge area near the Station is an alpine                    
              tundra study area that is designated an NSF-supported Long-Term                
              Ecological Research Site, an Experimental Ecological Reserve by                
              the U.S. Forest Service and the Institute of Ecology, and a                    
              Biosphere Reserve by UNESCO and the U.S. State Department.  Dr.                
              Bowman requests support for purchase of two snowmobiles for                    
              research use, an upgrade of their weather station equipment, and               
              winterization of the Station's water supply system.                            
                   The proposed equipment acquisitions and site improvements to              
              the Mountain Research Station would make it possible for research              
              projects to operate during the winter months, and would increase               
              the quality and quantity of environmental data gathered at the                 
              Station.  Research on the fragile tundra environment is                        
              especially critical to our understanding of global climate                     
              change.  This field station has supported leading research in                  
              this area, and continued improvement to this facility will                     
              enhance future research significantly.
