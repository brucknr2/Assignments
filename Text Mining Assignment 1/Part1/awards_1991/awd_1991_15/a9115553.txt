Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research in             
              solid mechanics between Xanthippi Markenscoff of the University                
              of California in San Diego and Helmut Kirchner of the Institute of             
              Materials Science at the University of Paris (South).  The objective           
              of their research is to develop a mathematical model which                     
              addresses dislocation effects in fracture mechanics.  Dr.                      
              Markenscoff brings to this cooperation innovative approaches to                
              problems involving the dynamics of dislocations in structures and              
              the elasticity of structural materials.  This is complemented by the           
              French investigator's extensive experience in dislocation theory and           
              numerical approaches to elasticity problems.                                   
                                                                                             
              The investigators are dealing with important issues in mechanics               
              which are often stumbling blocks to effective evaluation of                    
              construction materials.  Their joint effort will result in a unified           
              theory and mathematical model which will advance our                           
              understanding of the mechanical behavior of structures and the                 
              effects of dislocation on fractured solids.
