Abstract    :
              This is a proposal to conduct a workshop composed of NSF grantees              
              whose awards were made in the two years of competitions under the              
              Coordination Theory and Collaboration Technology (CT2)                         
              Initiative.  Three additional grantees whose work is closely                   
              related are also included.  The total number of grants involved                
              is twenty.  The purposes of the workshop are:  First, to provide               
              a forum for the exchange of knowledge in the form of                           
              perspectives, findings, methods and theory for this young,                     
              interdisciplinary field.  Second, to provide an opportunity for                
              the field to coalesce and grow.  While certain subsets of the                  
              community of researchers mingle at various professional meetings,              
              as a whole, these investigators do not have regular contact.  The              
              workshop provides an opportunity to establish an identity for the              
              area of work and to plan subsequent activities.  Third, this                   
              provides an opportunity for the research from these 20 projects                
              to be made more visible to the Washington based research funding               
              and policy community.  This workshop represents a planning                     
              opportunity for the IT&O Program.  The future research agenda for              
              CT2 funding and community building is an important part of the                 
              workshop program.  The workshop is held on June 3-5, 1991 in                   
              Washington, D.C.  A workshop report will be prepared and made                  
              available through publications and in response to requests.
