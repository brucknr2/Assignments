Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator (PI) will explore buffer management            
              policies for ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) networks.  Traffic               
              concentrators and switch buffers will be modeled as queues with                
              impatient customers, possibly belonging to different priority                  
              classes.  The impatient customers correspond to cells or packets               
              from time-constrained traffic such as voice or video.  The focus               
              here is the development of optimal scheduling policies which, for              
              example, maximize the number of customers served before their                  
              respective deadlines.  The techniques used will be based on sample             
              path comparisons, stochastic dominance, and stochastic dynamic                 
              programming.
