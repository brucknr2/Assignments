Abstract    :
                   The PI has been using the NCAR community climate model                    
              version one (CCM1) coupled with a mixed layer ocean to study the               
              climatic effects of CO2 and other trace gases (OTGs) CH4, N2O,                 
              CFC13 and CF2C12.  His experiments suggest that OTGs provide an                
              important heating source to the earth-atmospheric climate system.              
              Because the radiative-forcing behavior of CO2 is very different                
              from the OTGs, the PI's model simulations show that different                  
              radiative forcing can lead to quite different climatic effects.                
              This research program will continue the study with emphasis on                 
              the climatic feedback.  Three tasks are proposed.  First a                     
              detailed diagnosis of CCM1 simulations with focus on climate                   
              feedback.  Second, use of the CCM2 to study the climatic effects               
              of C02 and OTGs.  CCM2 includes major improvements in physical                 
              and dynamical parameterization and is much more realistic for                  
              climate studies.  Therefore, comparisons of the climatic effects               
              due to atmospheric trace gases between CCM1 and CCM2 offer a                   
              unique opportunity to study their sensitivity to model                         
              formulations.  The third task is to evaluate the feedback effect               
              of cloud optical properties, which has been identified                         
              potentially to be a strong negative feedback mechanism during                  
              climate changes.  This research is important because it seeks to               
              increase understanding of how trace gases influence climate.
