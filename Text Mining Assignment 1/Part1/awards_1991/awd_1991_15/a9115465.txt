Abstract    :
              A study of the intermediate scale, time-dependent coupling of the              
              solar wind, magnetosphere and ionosphere is proposed.  Such a study            
              will allow for a detailed investigation of how energy, momentum and            
              mass is transferred from the solar wind across the magnetopause,               
              into the magnetosphere, and along auroral field lines into the                 
              ionosphere.  Both analytic and numerical techniques will be used to            
              describe the dynamics of localized reconnection at the                         
              magnetopause, and the relation of reconnection to the impulsive                
              penetration of plasma and to the response of the magnetopause to               
              dynamic pressure perturbations in the solar wind.  A previously                
              developed numerical model will be used to describe the global                  
              response of the magnetosphere to driving perturbations at the                  
              magnetopause.  On a more localized scale, a three-dimensional model            
              is being developed to describe the detailed interaction of auroral             
              currents with the ionosphere.  This model, along with accompanying             
              analytic theory, will be used to describe the trapping of Alfven               
              waves in the cavity formed by the sharp increase of the Alfven                 
              speed above the ionosphere.  The overall goal of this research                 
              program is the understanding and modeling of the plasma processes              
              which couple energy from the solar wind to the ionosphere.
