Abstract    :
              This project is concerned with the far infrared properties of a                
              number of semiconductors at large hydrostatic pressures.  High                 
              resolution far infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy of ground               
              state to bound excited state transitions of donors associated with             
              conduction band minima which become global minima at large                     
              hydrostatic pressures will be performed.  The effect of hydrogen on            
              the formation of DX-centers in gallium arsenide and other compound             
              semiconductors wil be studied.  Th formation of DX-centers in                  
              gallium arsenide alloyed with aluminum presents a major technical              
              problem in the design and fabrication of a number of optoelectronic            
              devices.  These novel studies promise to yield important data on               
              the band structure and on dopants and defects at large hydrostatic             
              pressures.  This effort is made possible through advances in the               
              design of high pressure diamond anvil cells and sensitive far                  
              infrared photoconductive detectors.
