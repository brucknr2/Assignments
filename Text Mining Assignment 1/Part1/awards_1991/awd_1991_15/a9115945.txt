Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award, made under th Small Grants for Exploratory Research                
              program, will fund observations and data analysis to test the                  
              possibility of obtaining reliable redshifts by photometric methods.            
              This technique, largely developed by Dr. Loh, remains                          
              controversial, and this research should clearly demonstrate its                
              reliability, or lack thereof.
