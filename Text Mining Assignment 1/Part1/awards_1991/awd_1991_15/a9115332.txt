Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal is a request for travel assistance for about 30                  
              U.S. academic participants in the Conference.  Travel and                      
              associated conference expenses have been estimated at $2,400                   
              per U.S. attendee.  Under this great thirty assistance awards                  
              in the amount of $1,000 each would be made to each                             
              participating academic.  The primary aim of the conference on                  
              adsorption is to allow scientists and engineers from many                      
              countries to present their most recent research findings.                      
              Adsorption is a broad field and this conference will present                   
              participants with the opportunity for informal interaction.                    
              Moreover, it will permit U.S. participants to get a better                     
              view of Japanese activity.  It is expected that new course                     
              materials at the graduate and undergraduate levels will result                 
              from conference participation.
