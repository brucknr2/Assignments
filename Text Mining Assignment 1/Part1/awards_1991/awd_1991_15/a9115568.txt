Abstract    :
              This project will investigate the numerical solution of discrete               
              Markov chains, with an emphasis on the computation of the steady-state         
              vector of ergodic chains.  Although the problem can be cast as an              
              ordinary eigenvalue problem, it is special in two ways.  First, the            
              eigenvalue in question, namely one, is known exactly.  Second, many of         
              the applications, such as queuing modeling, have special structure             
              that can be exploited computationally.  Consequently, diverse methods          
              have been set forth, some of which are poorly understood.  The goal of         
              this work is to improve understanding of their theory, their                   
              interrelations, and their implementation, particularly parallel                
              implementations, beginning with a classification of the methods and            
              then focusing on particularly promising algorithms.
