Abstract    :
              One of the most exciting breakthroughs of the 1980's in stellar                
              physics is the study of nonradial pulsations to the study of                   
              the interiors of white dwarf stars.  Much of the previous success              
              of previous efforts has been because of the ability of astronomers             
              to match observed periods in white dwarf variable stars to periods             
              computed from theoretical models determined by the Principal                   
              Investigator (PI).  In this three year program the PI will extend              
              his previous work to evolutionary models of stars and will enable              
              the effects of changes in the star's structure from its evolution              
              to be predicted for timescales considerably shorter than a human               
              lifetime (e.g. a decade).  This work will also permit the effects              
              of important but hithero only crudely treated processes, such as               
              chemical separation, to be included in these calculations.                     
              This work will have application not only to the study of white                 
              dwarf evolution but to the studies of "asteroseismology" of other              
              stars as well, possibly including the Sun.
