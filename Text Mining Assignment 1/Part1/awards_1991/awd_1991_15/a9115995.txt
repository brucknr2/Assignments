Abstract    :
              In this project, the PI, a graduate student, and a collaborator                
              from Italy will extend an Eddy Resolving General Circulation Model             
              of the Eastern Mediterranean Sea to include air-sea interaction                
              and vertical mixing, and apply it to observed circulation in the               
              eastern Mediterranean Sea.  In addition, data from the recent POEM             
              (Physical Oceanography of the Eastern Mediterranean) study will be             
              analyzed.
