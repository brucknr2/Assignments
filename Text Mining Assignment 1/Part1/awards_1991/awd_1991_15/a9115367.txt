Abstract    :
              The constituents of many abundant elements on the Earth, including             
              those composing our own bodies, are manufactured during the brief              
              explosion stage of a massive star known as a supernova.  The                   
              Principal Investigator proposes to continue his theoretical work               
              on the advanced stages of evolution of stars, including several                
              aspects of supernova explosion.  His previous work has been pivotal            
              in the past to an understanding of the explosion of the Supernova              
              1987a from a blue supergiant progenitor. The continuation of his               
              study will focus on providing the astronomical community with                  
              evolutionary models of stellar structure, of improving the physics             
              of semiconvection and diffusion on which these models have been                
              based, on treating the explosion of a supernova as a problem in the            
              well-understood context of stellar winds, and on improving the                 
              "rapid"-process rates of nucleosynthetic reactions.
