Abstract    :
              Proakis         This is a collaborative research project with Chrysostomos  L.
              Nikias (University of Southern California).  The research  focuses on the
              development, testing and mathematical analysis of  adaptive signal processing
              algorithms based on nonlinear  performance criteria.  Areas of research
              include:  1.     blind deconvolution algorithms based on criteria with memory 
              nonlinearity;  2.     decision feedback equalizers using higher-order
              statistics;  3.     joint estimation and detection algorithms of the ML-type
              and  MAP-type when the signals are Gaussian distributed;  4.     adaptive
              multichannel signal recovery algorithms when the  signals have gone through
              severe magnitude and phase distortion;  and  5.     blind deconvolution
              algorithms based on neural networks and  Volterra filters.         Special
              emphasis is placed on the investigation of the  numerical properties and
              performance of the algorithms.   Performance metrics being considered include
              probability of error  in the restored sequence as a function of SNR,
              sensitivity to  signal statistics and data conditioning, rate of convergence, 
              choice of sliding windows and finite length effects.   Applications of the new
              algorithms are being considered in  digital communications, speech, image
              processing and geophysics.
