Abstract    :
              Thoretical research will be conducted in the general areas of                  
              nonlinear science and condensed matter physics.  Specific topics               
              include pattern formation in hydrodynamic systems, the scaling                 
              properties of dynamical systems, and the theory of well-developed              
              turbulence.  Specific applications include such topics as the                  
              mathematical structure of the equations describing the swirling                
              behavior of fluids, the motion of two-fluid boundaries, and the                
              structure of avalanches.

              Theoretical research will be carried out on nonlinear science and              
              its application to problems of interest to condensed matter                    
              physics.  Research on nonlinear science is developing rapidly and              
              its implications on condensed matter systems are only just being               
              probed.
