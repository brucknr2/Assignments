Abstract    :
              In this project, the PI's will to continue the study of physical               
              processes on the Amazon shelf as part of A Multidisciplinary                   
              Amazon Shelf SEDiment Study (AMASSEDS).  Moored, shipboard,                    
              drifter, and satellite data have been collected over a period of               
              two years to investigate the geological, chemical, and physical                
              processes that control the distributions and fluxes of fresh                   
              water, salt, and sediment across the Amazon shelf.  Specific focus             
              is on tides, frontal dynamics, wind-driven motions, and the                    
              influence of the North Brazil Current on the currents, hydro-                  
              graphy, and suspended sediment distributions on the shelf.                     
              Collaborative efforts address the role of physical processes in                
              controlling the distributions and fluxes of sediments and                      
              chemicals in the water column, and across the sediment-water                   
              interface.
