Abstract    :
                   Dr. Harlyn Halvorson is the Director of the Marine Biological             
              Laboratory in Woods Hole, Massachusetts.  MBL has been an important            
              international center for marine research since its founding in                 
              1888.  The Lab continues to be an active locus of diverse research             
              by resident and visiting scientists.  Dr. Halvorson plans to                   
              improve the research capabilities of the Lab by acquiring lab                  
              instruments (two centrifuges and an on-line gas chromatograph                  
              combustion system for the Lab's mass spectrometer) and a monitoring            
              station for meteorological and hydrological data, and by extending             
              the existing computer network to several buildings.                            
                   These proposed improvements will expand the range of research             
              conducted at the Lab, and will provide visiting scientists with                
              much greater access to computing facilities on the MBL campus and              
              at their home institutions.  The addition of the gas chromatograph             
              to the mass spectrometer will significantly reduce the sample                  
              volume needed for precise measurements of isotopic ratios, thereby             
              increasing the range of environments that can be sampled and                   
              analyzed.  These items will allow the Marine Biological Lab to                 
              continue its outstanding service to the research community.
