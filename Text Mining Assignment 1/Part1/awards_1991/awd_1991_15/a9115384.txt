Abstract    :
              This project deals with so-called low temperature copper oxide                 
              superconductors.  The focus of research will be on the electron-               
              doped neodyium-cerium-copper-oxygen system.  The research will                 
              employ a substantial range of physical measurements on the same                
              single crystal material grown in the principal investigators                   
              laboratory.  The objective is to gain a better understanding of the            
              mechanism of superconductivity and the nature of the anomalous                 
              state in all copper oxide superconductors.  The research will                  
              complement similar investigations in the high temperature copper               
              oxide superconductors.  Measurements on high quality single                    
              crystals with a systematic variation of dopants should enable this             
              goal to be achieved and also allow the insulator to metal                      
              transition at low dopant to be better understood.
