Abstract    :
                   The Sagehen Creek Field Station is located at an elevation                
              of 2,000 meters in the Tahoe National Forest on the eastern slope              
              of the Sierra Nevada Mountains in California.  Sagehen Creek                   
              Station is part of the University of California Natural Reserve                
              System and is operated by the Department of Forestry and Resource              
              Management of the University of California, Berkeley.  Ecological              
              research is conducted on the stream and montane forest habitats                
              at the Station, and the facility has an especially strong record               
              of supporting graduate student research projects.  Dr. Reginald                
              Barrett, Director of the Station, proposes to upgrade the                      
              meteorological monitoring station at Sagehen Creek Field Station.              
              The Station has operated a U.S. Weather Service recording station              
              for 38 years, and the requested upgrade would replace obsolete                 
              equipment and establish the ability to transfer data from                      
              removable EPROM storage packs to a microcomputer.                              
                   The proposed meteorological station improvement would                     
              increase the reliability and continuity of the weather data being              
              recorded at the Station.  Many research projects would benefit                 
              directly from this improvement, as would the region's weather
