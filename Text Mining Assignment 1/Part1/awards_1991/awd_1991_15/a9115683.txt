Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The PI will perform rock magnetic and physical properties                      
              measurements on sediments of DSDP Site 317 on the Manihiki                     
              Plateau to determine the relationship between fast plate motion                
              and mantle plume volcanism during the mid Cretaceous.  The                     
              results will help test various models proposed to explain the                  
              super fast plate velocities.
