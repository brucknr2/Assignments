Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The deepening economic crises in Eastern Europe and the Soviet                 
              Union and the economic stagnation in China, have political causes              
              and consequences that contemporary political science is ill                    
              equipped to analyze.  Few of the most powerful theories developed              
              for western regimes apply in the former eastern bloc nations.  Area            
              studies experts are theoretically uninformed and know too little               
              about either political economy or systematic research methods.                 
                                                                                             
              This research training workshop attempts to remedy this situation              
              by bringing together some of the Soviet area specialists,                      
              democratic theorists, and research methodologists for a series of              
              intensive sessions.  The senior participants will benefit from the             
              interdisciplinary exchange of ideas and participating graduate                 
              students will have an unusual opportunity to work with and                     
              synthesize the ideas of the leaders in the field.
