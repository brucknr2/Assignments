Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The 37 year oceanographic time series at the "Panulirus"                       
              hydrographic station at station S, southeast of Bermuda will be                
              extended for another five years.  The data gathered, calibrated,               
              archived at the Bermuda Biological Station for Research is                     
              available to the scientific community for studies of long-term                 
              changes in oceanic climate.
