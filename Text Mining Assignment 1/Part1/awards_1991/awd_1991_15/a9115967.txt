Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Shared Research Instrumentation                  
              Program will help the Department of Chemistry at Yale                          
              University to acquire four RISC workstations and some ancillary                
              equipment. The areas of chemical research that will be enhanced                
              by the acquisition include:                                                    
                                                                                             
              1.  the spectroscopy of high-lying electronic states of small                  
              molecules                                                                      
                                                                                             
              2.  trajectory calculation on the organic chemiionization                      
              reactions                                                                      
                                                                                             
              3.  model processes occuring in the ionic clusters                             
                                                                                             
              4.  the dynamics and spectroscopy of small molecules in high                   
              rovibronic states                                                              
                                                                                             
              5.  the spin interactions and electronic properties measured in                
              solid-state NMR

              Chemists carrying out frontier research are relying more and                   
              more on computers that are capable of handling sophisticated                   
              simulations, data analysis and graphics software.  The                         
              workstations which will be purchased with this grant are not                   
              only powerful and cost effective computers by themselves, but                  
              will serve also as communication links to allow transfer of                    
              data to and from other workstations and to provide access to                   
              remotely located more powerful computers.
