Abstract    :
                   Dr. Kenneth Tenore is the Director of the Chesapeake                      
              Biological Laboratory, which is one of three campuses of the                   
              University of Maryland's Center for Environmental and Estuarine                
              Research.  The Lab is located along the western shore of the                   
              Chesapeake at the mouth of the Patuxent River, and the facility                
              is used by resident and visiting scientists for research in                    
              ecology, environmental chemistry, the biology and geochemistry of              
              estuarine sediments, and fisheries biology.  Dr. Tenore proposes               
              to establish a new facility at the Lab for research that employs               
              techniques from molecular biology, biochemistry, and                           
              biotechnology.                                                                 
                   The new facility will allow researchers to prepare and store              
              samples for analysis, culture cells in the laboratory, and                     
              perform a variety of molecular and biochemical analyses.  Making               
              these new techniques available to investigators at the Lab will                
              significantly enhance a substantial number of environmental                    
              research projects.
