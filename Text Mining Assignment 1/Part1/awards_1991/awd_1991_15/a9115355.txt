Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research in             
              biophysics between Joachim Frank from the New York State                       
              Department of Health in Albany and Jean Lamy at the University                 
              of Tours.  The objective of their research is to develop a                     
              methodology for localizing binding sites of antibodies on                      
              immunocomplexes.  Specifically, they will work on mapping                      
              antigenic epitopes in A. Hemocyanin molecules.  The methodology                
              involves using electron microscopy and three dimensional                       
              reconstruction techniques.  Dr. Frank and his group bring to this              
              collaboration innovative technology for image reconstruction.  The             
              Albany Lab has developed a large specialized software system for               
              three-dimension imaging of macromolecules and two-dimensional                  
              maps.  This is complemented by the French laboratory's extensive               
              experience in immunochemistry and protein chemistry of A.                      
              Hemocyanin.  In addition the project will benefit from their                   
              previous collaboration on three-dimensional reconstruction.                    
                                                                                             
              The use of this model system is of great interest to researchers in            
              macromolecular chemistry.  The proposed techniques will facilitate             
              the mapping of binding sites of macromolecules, which cannot be                
              crystallized and are too large for conventional x-ray                          
              crystallography.  The knowledge gained from this project will be               
              beneficial to researchers in biochemistry and molecular biology.
