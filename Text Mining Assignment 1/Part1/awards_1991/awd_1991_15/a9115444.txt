Abstract    :
              In this project sponsored by the Experimental Physical                         
              Chemistry Program, Professor George Ewing of Indiana University                
              will use infrared and fluorescence spectroscopy to map patterns                
              of energy flow for small molecules weakly adsorbed on single                   
              crystal insulator surfaces. This includes developing techniques                
              for growing well-ordered monolayers on well-defined surfaces,                  
              and studies of two dimensional phase transitions as well as                    
              obtaining rates of vibrational dephasing, radiation, phonon                    
              excitation, and photodetachment. The work is important because                 
              it illustrates differences between insulator surfaces which                    
              bind intact molecules weakly, and more commonly studied                        
              conducting (metallic) surfaces which involve much stronger                     
              atom-surface interactions.                                                     
              %%%                                                                            
              Molecules bound to metal surfaces are often destroyed by the                   
              strong bonding forces. By focussing attention on molecules                     
              bound to insulators, Professor Ewing (Indiana University) is                   
              able to learn how energy flows between a surface and intact,                   
              weakly bound molecules. This provides a unique glimpse into the                
              chemistry of fundamental processes involved in friction and                    
              lubrication.
