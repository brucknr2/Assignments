Abstract    :
              Among the most impressive strides in astrophysics over the last                
              decade has been in the area of the physics of compact stars.  Part             
              of the reason for these advances has been the less visible but                 
              equally important progress made in the theory of their internal                
              structure.  In the past several years the Principal Investigator               
              (PI) has been at the forefront of the application of solid-state               
              theoretical physics to the construction of models of white dwarfs              
              and neutron stars.  This three-year award will provide support for             
              the continued research in this general area, including a wide                  
              variety of topics ranging from neutron stars, to "brown dwarfs,"               
              to giant planets.  This work will include research into the                    
              oscillation frequency spectrum (how these objects vibrate) as                  
              well as the "equation of state" in them which permits an estimate              
              of temperature and pressure in their interiors.
