Abstract    :
              This proposal requests funds to purchase a 250 L fermentor                     
              and accessories to upgrade the Ohio State University                           
              Fermentation laborite to a large-scale fermentation                            
              facility.  The 250-liter fermentor and associated harvesting                   
              equipment will be used to grow microorganisms for the                          
              purification of large quantities of enzymes, antibiotics,                      
              bacterial insecticide toxin and various other sub-cellular                     
              components for detailed molecular and biochemical research.
