Abstract    :
              The proposed research deals with the analysis of                               
              interconnected power networks when subjected to                                
              large disturbances such as the loss of a generating                            
              unit.  The vast majority of analytical work on power                           
              system dynamics deals with system behavior in                                  
              response to small disturbances.  In such cases                                 
              linearized analysis is appropriate.  For large                                 
              disturbances, nonlinear interactions can play an                               
              important role.  The approach used in this research                            
              extends energy-based methods to account for modal                              
              interactions.
