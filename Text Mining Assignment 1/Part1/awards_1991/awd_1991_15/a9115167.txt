Abstract    :
                   Dr. Wade Sherbrooke is the Director of the Southwestern                   
              Research Station, which is owned and administered by the American              
              Museum of Natural History.  The Station is located in the                      
              Chiricahua Mountains of southeastern Arizona in an area of                     
              diverse desert and montane habitats.  Research projects conducted              
              at the Station focus on a broad spectrum of species and topics.                
              Dr. Sherbrooke proposes construction of enclosures for behavioral              
              studies and acquisition of museum storage cabinets for specimens               
              collected during research projects, specimen freezer, analytical               
              balance, and electric current stabilizer.                                      
                   The behavioral enclosures will facilitate research by a                   
              large number of visiting investigators, and will open up new                   
              research projects on diverse organisms.  The specimen storage                  
              equipment is critical for the proper curation of reference                     
              specimens and for preservation of frozen tissues for biochemical               
              analyses.  These items of equipment will provide significant                   
              benefits to a variety of research projects.
