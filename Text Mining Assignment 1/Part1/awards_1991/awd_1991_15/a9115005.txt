Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Research, primarily experimental, will be focused on the                       
              various instability phenomena which occur for thin liquid                      
              films flowing over a solid surface. Non-linear interaction                     
              between solitary waves, three-dimensional wave patterns, and                   
              the growth of spatial and temporal disorder will be                            
              investigated. Film thickness observations will be used to test                 
              various current methods and theories for the representation                    
              and analysis of spatially and temporally complex data.                         
                                                                                             
              Film flow instabilities are of intrinsic interest in a variety                 
              of technologies. In addition, films are an excellent testing                   
              ground of emerging ideas involving disorder and noise, and                     
              useful diagnostics to extract meaningful information from                      
              disordered systems. Thus the applicability is wider than only                  
              to thin films. ***//
