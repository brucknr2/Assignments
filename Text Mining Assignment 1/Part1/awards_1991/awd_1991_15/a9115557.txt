Abstract    :
              The objective of the proposed research is to understand the                    
              dynamics of the magnetosphere.  Magnetospheric physics is at a                 
              critical juncture; research to be carried out in the next few                  
              years should lay bared the dominant mechanisms for coupling the                
              ionized upper atmosphere to the solar wind on time scale as short              
              as a few minutes.  The science involved concerns more than the                 
              geophysical questions to be answered; the behavior of a cosmical               
              plasma system is being investigated.  Other less accessible                    
              examples of such systems are pulsars, radio galaxies and the                   
              solar atmosphere.  The Investigators have a long term program of               
              investigation of the magnetohydrodynamic processes that couple                 
              energy, momentum, and mass from the solar wind into the                        
              magnetosphere, ionosphere, and upper atmosphere.  Towards this                 
              objective, both students and P.I.s will undertake a mix of                     
              theory, data analysis, and interpretation of computer                          
              simulations.  In addition to contributing to understanding the                 
              fundamental processes that govern the magnetosphere, the work                  
              will be useful in such applications as monitoring and predicting               
              naturally occuring hazards to earth orbiting spacecraft.
