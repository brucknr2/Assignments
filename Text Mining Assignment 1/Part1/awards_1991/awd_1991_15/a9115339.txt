Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A combined biophysical model developed by the principal                        
              investigators based on the photoacclimation model of Denman and                
              Marra (1986) and the physical model of Price et al. (1986) will be             
              taken to sea to run in real-time mode with the ambient physical                
              forcing input to the model.  The real-time application will provide            
              a continuous view of the predicted water column while at sea, so               
              that physical and biological (especially photoacclimation state and            
              photosynthetic rate) samples can be collected at the appropriate               
              depths to directly test model accuracy.  One version of the model              
              will be initialized with preliminary measurements of the required              
              characteristics of the ambient environment using a variety of                  
              physical sensors as well as a specially designed biological sensor.            
              A second version will be re-initialized physically every tow hours             
              to ensure a more precise prediction of the instantaneous state of              
              the water column.  Validation data will include mixed layer depth              
              and depth profiles rate.  After the cruise, model refinements will             
              be developed based on subsequent reruns of the model with recorded             
              forcing to improve fits to the validation data by considering                  
              changes in both model formulation and parameterization.  The                   
              eventual goal is to use the validated biophysical model as a tool              
              to guide future field applications of the developing                           
              photoacclimation technology and theory.
