Abstract    :
                   This award will support a Topical Conference on Time-Dependent            
              Positioning: Modeling Crustal Motion.  Topical conferences are                 
              sponsored by the American Geophysical Union and are designed to                
              promote opportunities not normally available through the format of             
              large meetings.  The topic to time-dependent positioning spreads               
              into a variety of disciplines, including geophysics, seismology,               
              tectonophysics, geodesy, volcanology, hydrology, and global climate            
              change.  The conference objective is to bring these disciplines,               
              together to discuss new modeling techniques used in the                        
              geosciences, and to review and evaluate concrete results from these            
              related fields.
