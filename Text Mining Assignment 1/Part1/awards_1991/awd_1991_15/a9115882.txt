Abstract    :
              This award from the U.S.-Brazil Cooperative Science                            
              Program supports collaborative research in computer                            
              networking to be conducted by Dr. Mario Gerla of the                           
              University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), Dr. Jose                         
              A. Suruagy Monteiro of the Universidade Federal de                             
              Pernambuco (UFPE), Brazil, and Dr. Jose R. Boisson de                          
              Marca of the Pontificia Universidade Catolica do Rio de                        
              Janeiro (PUC), Brazil. The focus of the work will be to                        
              investigate various bandwidth and traffic allocation                           
              strategies for Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) networks                       
              and the interconnection of Local Area Networks (LANs),                         
              Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs) and Broadband-                               
              Integrated Service Digital Networks (B-ISDNs).                                 
                                                                                             
              The project will be synergistic.  It will use the                              
              expertise of the UCLA team to carry out the ATM                                
              bandwidth allocation and the interconnection tasks.  The                       
              UFPE group will focus on performance modeling and                              
              congestion control issues, and the PUC investigators                           
              will work on traffic characterization and on ATM                               
              bandwidth management.
