Abstract    :
              This award will support a workshop organized by                                
              Professor Chaim Poran of the University of North                               
              Carolina, Charlotte, in collaboration with Professor                           
              E. Retamal of the Institute for Research and Testing                           
              of Materials (IDIEM) at the University of Chile.  The                          
              aim of the workshop is to assemble U.S. and Chilean                            
              experts in geotechnical earthquake engineering and                             
              strong ground motion, in order to review critically                            
              the geotechnical instrumentation and associated                                
              research needs for seismic hazard research in Chile.                           
                                                                                             
              The workshop aims to examine the risk of damage and                            
              loss of life associated with facilities in Chile,                              
              which are constructed in highly seismic environments.                          
              It will also focus on the urgent need for geotechnical                         
              instrumentation and research in populated areas and at                         
              sites planned for development.  The Chileans will                              
              benefit from U.S. expertise in this field.  The U.S.                           
              side will gain an opportunity to apply lessons learned                         
              in Chile to promote earthquake hazard reduction                                
              efforts in the United States.
