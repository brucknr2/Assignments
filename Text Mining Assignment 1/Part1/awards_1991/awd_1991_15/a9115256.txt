Abstract    :
                   Dr. Ronald Benner is a research scientist at the Texas Marine             
              Science Institute at Port Aransas, on the Gulf of Mexico coast.                
              The Institute is the oldest continuously operating marine research             
              lab on the Texas Gulf Coast, and it hosts active research by                   
              investigators from the University of Texas and many other                      
              organizations.  Dr. Benner proposes acquisition of an elemental                
              analyzer (carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur) for                  
              general use at the Institute.  This instrument would be used by                
              resident and visiting scientists in biogeochemical research in a               
              variety of coastal environments.  This instrument would replace an             
              obsolete instrument and would greatly expand the lab's research                
              capacity.                                                                      
                   The proposed instrument acquisition will have immediate and               
              beneficial impacts on many active research programs.  The number               
              and accuracy of chemical analyses will increase at the Institute,              
              and graduate students and advanced undergraduates will be exposed              
              to the most modern research equipment currently available.
