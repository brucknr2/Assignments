Abstract    :
              Lipids capable of forming head-to-tail linear polymers will                    
              be derived from phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) which contains                   
              a primary amine on the headgroup and two long alkyl chains.                    
              PE analogs containing a terminal carboxyl group in one or                      
              both alkyl chains are the prototype polymer forming material                   
              that will be prepared.  Head-to-tail polymerization will be                    
              via amide bond formation between the PE head group amine and                   
              the terminal carboxyl groups (s) in he alkyl chains.  A                        
              terminal carboxyl group on one chain can form a linear bio-                    
              polymer, whereas, a terminal carboxyl group on both PE alkyl                   
              chains will permit a branched polymer to form (Scheme2).                       
              This new class of biopolymers will be tested for                               
              biodegradation using phospholipase A1, phospholipase A2,                       
              phospholipase D, and phospholipase C (see Scheme 3).  The                      
              lipases enzymatically cleave phospholipids at different sites                  
              and consequently these lipases may digest head-to-tail                         
              phospholipids.  The ability of lipases to degrade HTT                          
              polymers will depend on the substrate specificity of each                      
              lipase.  It is likely that lipase degradation will                             
              significantly vary depending on the polymer conformation,                      
              size alkyl chain lengths of the lipid, etc.  Thus the                          
              exploratory work described in this proposal is particularly                    
              high risk.  However if we can establish feasibility , then                     
              the potential pay off from the different polymers is                           
              enormous.
