Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The study will model the anomalously high fluid flow in the                    
              Cascadia accretionary wedge.  A coupled, time-dependent, non-linear            
              and finite 2D model will be enhanced by adding additional                      
              parameters, such as methane generation from solid organic matter               
              and mineral dissolution and precipitation.  Ocean Drilling hole                
              planned in this area will provide empirical constraints for the                
              model.
