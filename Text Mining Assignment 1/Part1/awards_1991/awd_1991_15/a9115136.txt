Abstract    :
              The driving of stellar winds from the radiation pressure of hot                
              stars was suggested early in the century, and has since been found             
              to provide a good explanation of mass loss in a wide variety of                
              astronomical objects, ranging from very hot ("O-type") stars, to               
              active galactic nuclei, to quasars.  In past NSF supported work the            
              Principal Investigator (PI) has demonstrated fundamental flaws in              
              earlier concepts of radiatively driven winds.  For example, it is              
              now clear that scattering of photons in dense winds inhibits the               
              growth of self-induced instabilities so that the winds only develop            
              mild inhomogeneities.  However, such instabilities have been                   
              observed in both optical and ultraviolet spectral lines and are                
              thought to indicate the presence of colliding winds moving at                  
              different speeds.  The shocks generated by these collisions may be             
              the primary source of x-rays in objects with radiatively driven                
              winds.  With this three-year award the PI and a postdoctoral fellow            
              will develop numerical simulations with more realistic atmospheric             
              models and to extend earlier analytical solutions to two and even              
              three dimensions. This work will assess the role of turbulent                  
              instabilities in the evolution of inhomogeneities through the wind             
              flow. It is expected that this work will ultimately have a wide                
              application to extragalactic objects in addition to O stars.
