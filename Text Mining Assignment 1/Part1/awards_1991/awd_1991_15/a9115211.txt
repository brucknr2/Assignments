Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This project will develop a new observational approach to                 
              investigate water-rock interaction in oceanic hydrothermal                     
              systems. The goal is to determine the distribution of trace                    
              elements in hydrothermally altered rocks on a micron scale using               
              the ion microprobe at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.  Data              
              for primary/secondary mineral pairs and vein minerals will allow               
              the evaluation of how specific metamorphic reactions influence                 
              the composition of hydrothermal fluids and altered oceanic crust.
