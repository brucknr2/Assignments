Abstract    :
              With this Grant for Explaratory Research Armstrong and Nebesny                 
              will attempt to create a completely new class of materials                     
              based on superlattices of phthalocyanines deposited by                         
              molecular beam epitaxy.  They will characterize the initial                    
              surface chemistries of the materials, answering questions such                 
              as the way in which the materials nucleate, and the method by                  
              which they stack.  The optical properties of the materials will                
              be explored.  Initial expectations would suggest that the                      
              materials may be important in fast optical switching - a                       
              situation that is not achievable completely with existing                      
              materials.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              %%%                                                                            
              The research, in the general area of Analytical and Surface                    
              Chemistry, focuses on the investigation of new superlattice                    
              materials created by unconventional molecular beam epitaxy.                    
              The work promises to lead to the preparation of novel                          
              superlattice materials with important optical properties which                 
              could lead to new optical switching devices. Because the work                  
              has high novelty and urgency it is being funded through a Grant                
              for Explaratory Research.
