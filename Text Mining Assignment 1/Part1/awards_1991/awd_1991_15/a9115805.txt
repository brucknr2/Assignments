Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This three-year award supports cooperative research on plasma                  
              processes in microelectronic materials between Eugene Irene of the             
              University of North Carolina and Bernard Agius of the University               
              of Paris (South), Orsay, France.  Plasmas are used extensively for             
              the preparation of thin films for application in microelectronic               
              devices.  In this proposal the investigators will study the                    
              mechanisms for changes in plasmas during film growth and surface               
              preparation and develop methods for modifying plasmas in order to              
              optimize desirable properties and minimize damage during                       
              preparation of thin films.                                                     
                                                                                             
              Using techniques developed at the University of North Carolina,                
              the U.S. investigator will focus on the evolution of plasma damage             
              processes, in particular, those properties which produce damage,               
              and the procedures which minimize damage.  Samples will be                     
              prepared and characterized using ECR (Electron Cyclotron                       
              Resonance). Characterization of these materials will be performed              
              simultaneously at both Orsay and North Carolina.  The project will             
              benefit from these combined efforts, the redundant experiments and             
              the complementary facilities.  This research will advance our                  
              knowledge about plasma processes and its relationship to the                   
              production of very thin films.  The results of this research will be           
              important to the development of high performance electronic                    
              devices.
