Abstract    :
              The determination of the abundances of stars from their high                   
              resolution spectra forms the most fundamental observational basis              
              for understanding how stars evolve through their life cycles.  The             
              Principal Investigator (PI) will continue his previous NSF-                    
              supported work to determine to what extent interior nuclear                    
              reactions are responsible for the creation of heavy elements, which            
              subsequently alter the chemical composition of  interstellar gas               
              via stellar mass loss and influence the evolution of future                    
              generations of stars.  The PI's new work will focus both on the                
              chemical composition of stars in our own Galaxy and in those of the            
              Magellanic Clouds in the Southern hemisphere.  In addition to                  
              concentrating on the production of certain heavy elements (Ge, Rb,             
              and Mo), the PI will concentrate on 13C, the light-metals abundances           
              in massive stars, Li abundance in solar-type stars, and the                    
              apparent chemical anomalies in chemically peculiar A stars known               
              as "lambda Bootis" stars.  In addition to clarifying the role of               
              networks of heavy-element nuclear reactions in stellar cores, this             
              research is expected to help our understanding of the possible                 
              roles of convective mixing and radiative diffusion in the envelopes            
              of many stars on the "main sequence."
