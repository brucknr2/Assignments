Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will support a two-year U.S.-Japan cooperative science              
              project between Professor Richard Bersohn, Department of                       
              Chemistry, Columbia University, and Professor Masahiro                         
              Kawasaki, Research Institute of Applied Electricity, Hokkaido                  
              University, Sapporo, Japan.  The project involves the study of                 
              reaction dynamics using laser Doppler spectroscopy.  New                       
              techniques in laser-induced fluorescence detection will be developed           
              using complementary experimental techniques.  Professor Bersohn                
              specializes in laser-induced fluorescence and Professor Kawasaki in            
              multiphoton ionization.
