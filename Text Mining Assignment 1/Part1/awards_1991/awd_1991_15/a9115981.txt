Abstract    :
              9115981  Pohl      Disorder in thin metallic and dielectric films on polished 
              crystalline silicon substrates is investigated by measuring heat  flow in the
              substrate.  Below several degrees K, the phonons will  not be scattered in the
              substrate; thus any scattering observed  will be induced by the disorder in the
              films.  A second study  focuses on the effect of dimensionality on the
              observation of  mechanical relaxation phenomena.  Thin metallic and diekectric 
              films will be deposited on silicon paddle oscillators.  The  technique has been
              refined so that it is sufficiently sensitive to  detect amorphous films less
              than 1nm thick.  One of the questions  to be answered is whether the relaxation
              which is characteristic of  all amorphous solids can also be observed in
              extremely thin films,  or only in extended, three dimensional bodies.  % % % 
              Thin films of metals or electrical insulators play an increasingly  important
              role in modern technology, e.g. as components in  integrated circuits in the
              semiconductor industry.  The current  study focuses on characterizing such
              films by measuring their  thermal and elastic properties.  A specific example
              are  microcrystalline films of fullerines (buckyballs).  In addition to 
              exploring their disorder, the potential of such films for storing  gases like
              helium or hydrogen will be investigated.  Preliminary  measurements have sshown
              an extremely high solubility for helium.   If a similar solubility could be
              achieved for hydrogen, this could  have considerable practical applications for
              energy storage.  ***
