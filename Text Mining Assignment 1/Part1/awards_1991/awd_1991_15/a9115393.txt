Abstract    :
              Scripps Institution of Oceanography will undertake an                          
              instrumentation development proposal to develop a bottom-                      
              transecting vehicle and sampling system to make consecutive                    
              measurements of sediment community oxygen consumption (SCOC)                   
              over long time scales.  Some of the most difficult ocean                       
              science data to collect, especially for seafloor benthic                       
              ecosystems, involve temporal variations in biogeochemical                      
              cycles.  Temporal infusions of organic matter represent an                     
              important food supply to vast areas of the deep sea.  The                      
              measurement of benthic community oxygen consumption via SCOC                   
              has been developed as a means of quantifying organic material                  
              mineralization and the flux of nutrients through the                           
              community.  The ability to make SCOC measurements over                         
              periods of time will benefit ongoing NSF-sponsored research                    
              projects.  The instrument system will be designed to operate                   
              autonomously on the sea floor to depths of up to 6,000 meters                  
              for periods of up to six months per deployment.  SCOC will be                  
              measured with respiration chambers and an oxygen micro-                        
              profiler at up to 26 different sites per mission.  The                         
              development of this bottom-transecting instrument as an                        
              autonomous programmable platform will also provide new                         
              technology for conducting time-series measurements of a                        
              variety of parameters in oceanic bottom water and sediments.
