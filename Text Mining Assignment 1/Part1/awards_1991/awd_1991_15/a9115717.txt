Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A new bathymetric chart of the South Pacific will involve                      
              incorporation of new bathymetric data as well as Seasat and Geosat             
              gravimetric data.  The production of the chart at this point is                
              seen to be cost-effective and to fill a gap where no updated charts            
              exist.  In all likelihood it will serve as a basis for future                  
              studies in the Southeast Pacific.
