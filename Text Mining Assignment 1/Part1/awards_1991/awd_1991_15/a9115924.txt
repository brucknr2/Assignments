Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Accretionary prisms form along the landward side of deep sea                   
              trenches in response to offscraping of oceanic sediments during                
              lithospheric subduction.  Several interrelated factors influence               
              the evolution of these thick sediment prisms including sediment                
              composition, physical properties, rate of underthrusting, and fluid            
              de-watering and migration within the offscraped sediment.  Fluid               
              migration and expulsion play an important role in the mechanical               
              behavior, fluid pressure and lithification of sediments in the                 
              deformation zone.                                                              
                                                                                             
              The present renewal award will complete study of the structure of              
              the Oregon accretionary margin using multichannel seismic                      
              techniques.  Under previous funding, 2000 km of data was acquired              
              along this margin.  Progress in analyzing the data has been                    
              excellent.  Both the sources and migration pathways of fluids can              
              be imaged in the data.  Continued analysis and interpretation will             
              focus on:  1) the role of basement topography in controlling                   
              structural evolution of the margin; 2) the nature of the fault zone            
              along which underthrusting occurs; 3) oblique faults which were                
              discovered during initial analysis of the data; and 4) the porosity            
              of the sediment sequence.  These data are the basis for a major ODP            
              drilling cruise to the area in late 1992.
