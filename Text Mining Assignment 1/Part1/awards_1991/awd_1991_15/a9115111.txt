Abstract    :
                   RUI: A Study of the Effects of Magnetic Activity on the                   
              Variation of Solar Luminosity                                                  
                        This proposal deals with observations related to contrast            
              features on the disk of the Sun. These are important since we have             
              found that the solar irradiance varies in accordance with these                
              contrast features on the solar disk. The PI's research aims to                 
              associate these changes with the various components of solar                   
              activity. This should help to understand energy transport in the               
              sun and thus the effects of solar activity on the Earth. Past work             
              has shown that faculae are an important source for irradiance                  
              enhancement. The authors will continue to obtain accurate, daily,              
              full-disk, photometric observations of the sun at various                      
              wavelengths. These allow modelling of irradiance variations in                 
              terms of sunspot, facular, plage, and network areas and                        
              intensities. These data will probe the physics of the interaction              
              of solar magnetic fields with convective energy outflow. Their work            
              will mostly be undertaken by students, making this project ideal               
              from NSF's point of view for the future of society.
