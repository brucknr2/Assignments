Abstract    :
              The objective of this workshop is to critically review and                     
              evaluate the significant developments in geomechanics in the                   
              recent past, and to discuss and identify the future trends that                
              will have a significant impact on basis and applied research in                
              this important interdisciplinary engineering area in the 21st                  
              century. Attention will be given to new and emerging areas                     
              including computer aided engineering, modeling and testing of a                
              wide range of available and new geo-materials, mechanical/in                   
              situ/centrifuge/non-destructive evaluation, neural network                     
              models/ expert systems/fuzzy sets, manufacturing underground                   
              space, global change and adverse geo-environmental  effects.
