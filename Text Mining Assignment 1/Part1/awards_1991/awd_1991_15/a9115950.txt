Abstract    :
                   Dr. Frank will conduct an investigation of the processes that             
              lead to tropical cyclone development in the western Pacific.  The              
              study, which combines observational analyses and numerical modeling            
              experiments, will focus on the earliest stages of cyclogenesis.                
                   Occasionally, a strong mesoscale vortex forms within a loosely            
              organized tropical cloud cluster.  Over the years, researchers have            
              developed a fairly clear picture of the processes which cause some             
              of these vortices to grow into mature tropical cyclones (the                   
              "intensification" phase of the hurricane/typhoon life cycle).  By              
              comparison, the "genesis" phase is very poorly understood.  Dr.                
              Frank will examine the large scale circulation patterns present                
              during tropical cyclogenesis, the origins of these patterns, and               
              the physical processes leading to vortex formation.  Synoptic-scale            
              surges of southwesterly flow into the West Pacific Monsoon Trough              
              are frequently observed to precede cyclogenesis in this region.                
              Particular attention will be given to their role in cyclogenesis.              
              The observational analyses will be based on a five year global data            
              set, and on high resolution data sets collected during the Tropical            
              Cyclone Motion experiment of 1990, in which Frank participated.                
              The modeling studies will employ the newly developed nonhydrostatic            
              version of the PSU/NCAR mesoscale model to simulate vortex                     
              formation under a variety of conditions typical of the West                    
              Pacific.                                                                       
                   This research will be important for understanding, and                    
              ultimately predicting, the development of tropical cyclones.
