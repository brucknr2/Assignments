Abstract    :
              An innovative new technique for                                                
              laser doppler velocimetry will be                                              
              investigated that uses a continuous                                            
              wave (cw) source.  The use of a cw                                             
              rather than the conventional pulsed                                            
              laser should result in a light,                                                
              compact, rugged and more reliable                                              
              LDV system suitable for use in both                                            
              spacecraft and aircraft.  In                                                   
              addition, the use of multiple cw                                               
              beams and complimentary pseudo                                                 
              random codes should allow the vector                                           
              wind to be measured without scanning                                           
              the beams.  Potential applications                                             
              are global remote sensing of                                                   
              atmospheric winds, wind shear and                                              
              turbulence detection and primary air                                           
              instrumentation.  In order to obtain                                           
              range resolved wind and develop the                                            
              required signal to noise ratio,                                                
              pseudo random, diphase modulation of                                           
              the laser and a novel detection                                                
              scheme will be used.  The work is                                              
              primarily experimental with the goal                                           
              of demonstrating feasibility of this                                           
              new, innovative method.  An                                                    
              experimental system will be built                                              
              and evaluated by making range                                                  
              resolved wind measurements in the                                              
              atmosphere.
