Abstract    :
                This research program is focused on basic theoretical aspects                
              of ego-moving observer (e.g. a camera), a huge amount of visual                
              information is captured.  The aim of this project is to extract                
              relevant visual information from a sequence of images and to use               
              it as part of feedback control loops.  In other words, to                      
              characterize changing visual data using only a few variables                   
              which are essential for the dynamic response of the observer                   
              relative to the scene, and use these to control the motion of the              
              observer.  The vision-based algorithms will be integrated in a                 
              real-time closed loop control system that has been developed at                
              FAU.  In addition, the Robot Systems Division at the National                  
              Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has agreed to                     
              provide FAU with all the available hardware and software that are              
              necessary for the successful completion of this project.  Based                
              on previous and on-going research work, there is reason to                     
              believe that a new, promising direction for visual motion with                 
              sound theoretical basis is emerging.
