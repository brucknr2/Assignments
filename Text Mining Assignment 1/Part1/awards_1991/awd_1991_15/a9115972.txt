Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award supports cooperative research between Hellmut Eckert                
              of the University of California at Santa Barbara, and Michel Ribes             
              and Annie Pradel of the University of Montpellier.  The objectives             
              are to determine the structural characteristics of ionically                   
              conductive chalcogenide glass using modern solid state NMR                     
              (nuclear magnetic resonance) techniques.  The French investigators             
              will synthesize these glasses.  Dr. Eckert will characterize the               
              synthesized materials using state-of-the art solid state NMR                   
              techniques.  The work will assist in the development of more                   
              efficient synthesis of glassy materials suitable for solid electrolyte         
              application in solid state batteries.                                          
                                                                                             
              The project will benefit from the French investigators unique and              
              innovative expertise in glass synthesis.  They are the world leaders           
              in ultra fast quenching methodology which is used in glass                     
              synthesis.  The U.S. investigator has been innovative in applying              
              NMR techniques to the structural study of glass.  This combined                
              effort will advance our understanding of the microstructure of these           
              glasses and result in improved and more efficient synthesis of                 
              glasses with high conductivity.
