Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award supports research by one of the leading observers in                
              the field of observational cosmology on questions of the                       
              distribution and evolution of galaxies, and the origin of radio                
              galaxies.  Investigations of the mechanisms responsible for the                
              more rapid evolution of galaxies in rich environments will be                  
              carried out, and the relation between radio galaxies and their                 
              surroundings will be probed.  In a related effort, the                         
              distribution of galaxies on very large scales will be studied.
