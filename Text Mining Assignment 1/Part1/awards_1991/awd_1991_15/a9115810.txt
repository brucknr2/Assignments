Abstract    :
                   This proposal is submitted for consideration in the FY-92                 
              instrumentation competition conducted by the Division of Social and            
              Economic Science of the National Science Foundation.                           
                   Applied economics research within the Department of Economics             
              at MIT,  particularly in the areas of monetary and fiscal policy,              
              financial economics,  labor economics,  and economic planning in               
              developing countries,  requires computational support for                      
              processing and statistical analysis of large data sets,  as well               
              as related forecasting and simulation activities.  This proposal               
              will provide scientific workstations for applied economics faculty,            
              and their research assistants,  with sufficient storage and                    
              computational capacity to carry out this research program.  In the             
              past,  the research program has been limited to projects that could            
              be performed on personal computers,  or which have large extramural            
              budgets for mainframe computing.  The workstations provided under              
              this proposal will expand substantially the flexibility of the                 
              research program,  provide research assistants earlier access to               
              the analysis of large data sets,  and permit studies that                      
              previously could not be done with available resources.                         
                   The MIT Economics Department is among the best in the country.            
              The type of research which it proposes accords with core objectives            
              of NSF's Division of Social and Economic Science and its potential             
              contribution to the education and development of human resources               
              is outstanding.
