Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project involves laboratory experiments designed to quantify              
              the mantle melting processes that lead to the generation of mid-               
              ocean ridge basalts.  The overall goals of the work are to                     
              understand the range of depths, the extents of melting and the                 
              melting mechanisms that operate in the earth's upper mantle to                 
              produce magmas under the mid-ocean ridges.  Two projects will be               
              conducted:  (1) melting experiments on basalt-analog compositions              
              carried out over the pressure range of 10 to 25 kbar, and (2)                  
              diffusion experiments at 15 to 20 kbar.
