Abstract    :
                                                                                              
               This is a joint effort (involving LSU, UT and ORNL) to study                 
              intrinsic, normal-state electronic properties of materials that                
              form high-temperature superconductors.  Measurements will be made              
              of Landau quantum oscillations in both the normal (n) and                      
              superconducting (sc) mixed states .  The physics studied includes              
              Fermi-surface topologies, effective masses and scattering rates for            
              electrons in the n state; the interaction of n electrons with flux             
              vortices in the mixed state; and superconductivity in the presence             
              of a strongly Landau-quantized, n-state background.                            
                                                                                             
                                          %  %  %                                            
                                                                                             
                The measurements are expected to furnish unique data that will               
              lead to a better understanding of the precise nature of high-                  
              temperature superconductivity.
