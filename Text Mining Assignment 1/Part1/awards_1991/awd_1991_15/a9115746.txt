Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This study is an investigation of the fundamentals of heat and                 
                                                                                             
              mass transfer occurring during the steam cleaning of                           
              contaminants adsorbed in soil.  The heat transfer and the                      
              condensate and gas flow are analyzed assuming local thermal                    
              equilibrium, convection, dispersion, gravity, capillarity and                  
              diffuso- and thermo-capillarity.  The mass transfer among the                  
              phases (solid, liquid, and gas) are analyzed based on local                    
              non-equilibrium assumptions.  The interfacial mass transfer                    
              coefficients and the specific surface areas are obtained by a                  
              direct simulation of two-phase flow in a phenomenological                      
              unit-cell.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              Experiments are performed in soil columns using contaminant                    
              simulants with a controlled initial equilibrium (solid-gas)                    
              condition prior to injection of steam.  Transient local                        
              temperature, capillary pressure, and contaminant concentration                 
                                                                                             
              (in liquid and gaseous phases) measurements are made.  The                     
              results of the experiments will be compared to those predicted                 
                                                                                             
              in order to examine the validity of the phenomenological unit-                 
                                                                                             
              cell based kinetic model.                                                      
                                                                                             
              The proposed research will allow for the development and                       
              critical verification of the pore-level analysis of heat and                   
              mass transfer in soil during steam cleaning.  For the first                    
              time, the local velocity and local saturation dependence of                    
              the mass transfer rates among the three phases will be                         
              determined by a direct simulation and will be verified                         
              experimentally.   The results will also be valuable for                        
              analysis/prediction of the isothermal remediation processes.
