Abstract    :
              This award provides funds for the further development and                      
              construction of devices that reflect, focus and filter neutrons                
              used for structural studies of biomolecules and biomolecular                   
              assemblies.  The devices will be used at the High Flux Beam Reactor            
              at Brookhaven National Laboratory, one of only a few such                      
              facilities in the world with sufficient flux for the analysis of               
              biological materials.  The development and use of these devices                
              will increase the neutron flux available at each of three                      
              spectrometers used for protein crystallography, membrane analysis              
              and small angle scattering.  Increased flux is particularly                    
              important to analysis of biological samples because it serves to               
              decrease the long exposure times typically required, thus reducing             
              the chance of sample denaturation during analysis and increasing               
              the throughput of the spectrometers.
