Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Molecular theory will be applied to the thermodynamics of                      
              adsorption in porous and heterogeneous solids.  This work will                 
                                                                                             
              improve the fundamental thermodynamic basis for separations                    
              based upon selective adsorption form fluid mixtures.                           
              Particular emphasis is placed upon bridging the gap between                    
              recent developments in statistical mechanics and engineering                   
              applications.  The two major thrusts are:  1) development of                   
              analytic expressions for adsorption equilibrium in porous                      
              solids and 2) the development of models for the influence of                   
              microstructure upon adsorption in heterogeneous solids such as                 
                                                                                             
              silica gel and activated carbon.  Analytic solutions of one-                   
              dimensional models will be used to analyze assumptions built                   
              into existing adsorption models and will provide a basis for                   
              improving them.  Monte Carlo simulations of detailed three-                    
              dimensional molecular models will be used to determine the                     
              effect of microstructure of the adsorbent on the adsorption                    
              equilibrium.
