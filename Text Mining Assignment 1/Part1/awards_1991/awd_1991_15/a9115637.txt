Abstract    :
              Professor George Phillies is supported by a grant from the                     
              Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to perform                     
              studies of structured fluids using optical probes.  The                        
              objective of the work is to study diffusion and transport in                   
              liquids with extended local structures such as micelles,                       
              vesicles and microemulsions.  The primary physical method is                   
              light scattering spectroscopy which can determine the diffusion                
              coefficients of mesoscopic particles through amphiphile                        
              solutions.  Computer simulations are used to examine the                       
              diffusion of small molecules through the pores of model glass                  
              formed from large immobile spheres.  These simulations, which                  
              incorporate Monte Carlo dynamics, molecular dynamics, and                      
              Brownian dynamics computations, model how particle motions are                 
              constrained by random static potentials.

              Probe motion in surfactant systems and porous media model                      
              aspects of a wide variety of important scientific and technical                
              processes, including self-organization of complex structures,                  
              intracellular diffusion in living cells, three phase catalysis,                
              and enzymatic post-processing of polymers in biochemical                       
              engineering.
