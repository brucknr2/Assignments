Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The >20 um size fraction of marine phytoplankton sinks faster                  
              than smaller components and is an important size fraction to                   
              consider in global flux out of the euphotic zone through the                   
              oceanic water column to the sediments.  In order to understand                 
              the abundance and biomass of the >20 um phytoplankton in the                   
              equatorial Pacific, multiple opening and closing net collections               
              as well as water bottle samples will be studied through this                   
              program from the seasonal JGOFS EQPAC cruises. The priority will               
              be to 2 seasonal time-series cruises within 20 north and south of              
              the equator in the area known to have the greatest flux of                     
              material to the sediments. The netplankton will be  concentrated               
              from different strata by a multiple opening and closing new                    
              system deployed at depths chosen to complement a similar                       
              zooplankton sampling scheme as well as to concentrate                          
              phytoplankton from the upper surface layers and just below the                 
              euphotic zone in a depth region identified as very active                      
              biogeochemically.  The seasonal survey cruises will allow                      
              meridional interpretations of the larger phytoplankton from water              
              bottle samples and vertical net hauls.  The larger diatoms and                 
              dinoflagellates are excellent indicators of the different water                
              masses encountered, and the life histories and vertical zonation               
              of the more heavily silicified diatom species found in equatorial              
              water will be used to test a possible relationship between degree              
              of silicification and growth-limiting conditions seen in higher                
              latitude waters.
