Abstract    :
              Thermal acoustic oscillations in tubes inserted into cryogenic                 
              systems can often introduce large quantities of heat into                      
              these systems.  Such unwanted heat leaks can seriously degrade                 
              long term storage of cryogenic fluids.  Very little has been                   
              done to develop a theoretical analysis of the heat transfer                    
              process during these oscillations.  The objective of the                       
              proposed research is to numerically analyze and stimulate                      
              thermal acoustic oscillations in cryogenic systems,                            
              particularly in liquid helium and hydrogen systems, predict                    
              the oscillation pressure amplitude, velocity and temperature                   
              profiles and finally, experimentally correlate the heat                        
              transfer associated with these oscillations.
