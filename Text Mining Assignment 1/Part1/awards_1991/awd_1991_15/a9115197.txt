Abstract    :
              The objectives of this research are to improve                                 
              understanding of flexural mechanisms in clay soil; to                          
              define relationships between distortion and permeability;                      
              to develop  field methodology to evaluate cap distress; and                    
              to quantify effects of reinforcement and soil stiffness on                     
              remedial geomembrane stress. Experimental study will be                        
              made of clay soil flexure and permeability. The                                
              relationship between bottom subsidence, surface depressions                    
              and internal stress and strain in caps using strain                            
              compatibility and crack propagation models adapted from                        
              finite element analysis of concrete will be modeled. The                       
              second phase of work will involve extending the FE analysis                    
              to include the effects of geosynthetic reinforcement and                       
              its interaction with a low-permeability soil layer. The FE                     
              model will be calibrated with the use of a large- scale                        
              physical model.
