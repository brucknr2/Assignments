Abstract    :
              This award supports a group of twelve U.S. experts in international            
              science and technology (S & T) policy, and especially U.S.-German              
              S & T relations, to participate in a U.S.-German seminar on                    
              bilateral cooperation in S & T.  The meeting is co-organized by                
              the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the                   
              Alexander von Humboldt Foundation of Germany, and the German                   
              Union of Technical and Scientific Societies.  It will take place               
              in Berlin from September 9 through 11, 1991.  The principal                    
              themes of the meeting are the globalization of S & T, the                      
              comparison of national issues in Research and Development                      
              funding, and addressing of public concerns about scientific                    
              developments.                                                                  
                                                                                             
              The objectives of the meeting are particularly relevant to the                 
              objectives of NSF's U.S.-German cooperative science program.                   
              They are to: 1) Review major areas of German-American cooperative              
              activities in S & T, considering strengths and weaknesses in                   
              these efforts; 2) Exchange views on future developments and new                
              opportunities for mutually beneficial cooperation; 3) Enhance                  
              relations between the two countries in S & T, focusing on pre-                 
              competitive research; and 4) Examine U.S.-German cooperation in                
              the context of regional and international developments.  The                   
              seminar findings and recommendations will be disseminated widely               
              to public and private organizations in the U.S. and Germany, as                
              well as other countries.  These recommendations are expected to                
              have implications not only for the future of U.S.-German bilateral             
              cooperation but also for international science policy.
