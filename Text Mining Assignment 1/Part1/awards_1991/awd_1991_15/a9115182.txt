Abstract    :
                   Dr. Robert Richmond is the Director of the University of                  
              Guam's Marine Lab, which is the only U.S. marine research                      
              facility in the western Pacific.  The Lab is actively used by                  
              resident and visiting investigators from the U.S. and many other               
              countries of the world, and this facility is fast becoming a                   
              center for international collaboration on tropical marine                      
              research.  Dr. Richmond proposes construction of a dormitory                   
              facility for use by visiting research scientists, and by students              
              taking courses at the Lab.                                                     
                   The proposed housing facilities will relieve current                      
              crowding and will allow expanded use of the research facilities                
              by visiting investigators.  The University of Guam's Marine Lab                
              will continue to develop into a globally-oriented locus of                     
              international research.  Important biological research in                      
              tropical marine habitats will benefit from the proposed                        
              facilities improvement.
