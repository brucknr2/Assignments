Abstract    :
              This award is support the porting of code of the software package              
              SPIDER from its present VMS environment to a UNIX environment.  The            
              SPIDER package is a unique image processing system for electron                
              microscopy which was developed by the principal investigator and               
              his associates.  This effort will make the new technology of single            
              particle averaging, correlation methods, multivariate statistics,              
              single-particle reconstruction and electron tomography available to            
              a large circle of users.  The strong interest among user groups in             
              such a conversion is documented.  The increased access of many user            
              groups to this large resources will make a significant contribution            
              to the fostering of Computational Biology.
