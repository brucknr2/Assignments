Abstract    :
              Knowledge of the molecular structures of proteins is increasingly              
              important as we try to understand their function and to modify that            
              function by altering their structures through genetic engineering.             
              One of the important physical tools for studying structure is                  
              vibrational (i.e., infrared and Raman) spectroscopy, since it is               
              not limited to the crystalline state (as is x-ray diffraction) or              
              to the solution state (as is high resolution NMR spectroscopy).                
              However, in order to realize its full potential, such spectroscopic            
              studies must progress beyond the band correlation stage to the use             
              of the rigorous methods of normal mode analysis, which permit                  
              detailed predictions to be made of spectral frequencies and                    
              intensities associated with a given three-dimensional structure.               
              A strong foundation for such approaches has been laid by refining              
              an empirical vibrational force field for the polypeptide chain and             
              applying it to normal mode calculations and the analyses of                    
              structure in some peptide and polypeptide systems.  Dr. Krimm will             
              now extend this approach to a number of new systems, involving                 
              peptide, polypeptide, and disulfide bridge conformations, and use              
              empirical as well as quantum-mechanical force fields to develop                
              molecular mechanics potential functions for accurate spectroscopic             
              predictions as well as molecular dynamics simulations.
