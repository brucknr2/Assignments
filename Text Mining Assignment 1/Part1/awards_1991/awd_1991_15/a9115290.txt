Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The National Academy of Sciences and the Soviet Academy of                     
              Sciences will conduct a joint workshop on Mechanisms of                        
              Membrane Channels to be held May 11-25, 1992 at the Woods                      
              Hole Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Massachusetts.                       
              The meeting will be chaired by Dr. Bertil Hille of the                         
              University of Washington and Academician Platon Kostyuk of                     
              the Bogomoletz Institute of Physiology in Kiev.  The                           
              workshop will bring together scientists working at the                         
              forefront of research in the area of biological membranes.                     
              Specific subjects to be addressed are:  biophysical and                        
              structural analysis of ion permeation and channel gating,                      
              calcium channels and their regulation through G-protein-                       
              coupled receptors; fast, ligand-gated channels of fast                         
              chemical synapses and sensory receptors; and broader cell                      
              biological approaches to neurosecretion and learning.                          
                                                                                             
              This project fulfills the program objective of advancing                       
              scientific knowledge by enabling leading researchers in                        
              the United States and the Russia to combine complementary                      
              efforts and capabilities in areas of strong mutual                             
              interest and competence in the field of basic scientific                       
              research on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and                            
              mutuality of benefit.
