Abstract    :
              A series of large metal clusters containing gold and silver                    
              will be synthesized and structurally characterized.  This                      
              series follows a well-defined growth sequence based on vertex-                 
              sharing, a feature that will be extended in this project.  The                 
              effect of changes in (typically) phosphine and halide ligands                  
              on the stereochemistry of the clusters will be systematically                  
              studied.  Clusters of high nuclearity but containing metal                     
              combinations such as Pt-Au, Pt-Au-Ag, Pd-Au, and Pd-Au-Ag will                 
              be prepared by synthetic routes analogous to those developed                   
              for the Au-Ag system.  Synchroton or rotating anode X-ray                      
              crystallography will be used for the structural determinations                 
              of the large clusters.  Since these clusters will be                           
              intermediate in size between individual atoms and extended                     
              lattices, it is possible that the results of these studies may                 
              be relevant to the nucleation and growth of fine particles,                    
              quasi-crystals, and amorphous materials.

              In this project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organo-                    
              metallic Program of the Chemistry Division, Dr. Boon K. Teo                    
              will synthesize, structurally characterize, and study the                      
              growth systematics of large clusters containing up to seventy-                 
              five metal atoms.  These species are near the interface between                
              large clusters and colloids, where interesting new materials                   
              having potential applications as electronic and magnetic                       
              materials and as catalysts may be anticipated.
