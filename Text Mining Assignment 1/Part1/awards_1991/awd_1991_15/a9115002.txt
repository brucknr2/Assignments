Abstract    :
                   This project would provide funds to the National Center for               
              Education Statistics to supplement a second follow-up of the                   
              mathematics and science teachers students in the National Education            
              Longitudinal Study of 1988.  Student questionnaires will be                    
              expanded by two pages of items on the nature and quality of                    
              mathematics and science courses offered.  Also, the teacher                    
              questionnaire would be expanded to induce specific items about                 
              courses and activities of teaching mathematics and science courses             
              taken by students in their twelfth year of school.  NCES has                   
              contracted this work with the National Opinion Research Center                 
              (NORC) at the University of Chicago.//
