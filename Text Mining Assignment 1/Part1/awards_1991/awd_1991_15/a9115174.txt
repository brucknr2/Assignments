Abstract    :
              The Principal Investigator (PI) is a previous Presidential Young               
              Investigator who has used much of his previous award to design                 
              and build a robotic telescope to monitor the light output of                   
              supernovae with time.  The PI now proposes to complement his                   
              light curve work with a coordinated program of high dispersion                 
              spectroscopy.  His goal is to establish a far greater degree of                
              homogenity in the classification of supernovae than has existed                
              in the past in order to define the evolutionary histories of these             
              objects, as will as the characteristics of their progenitor stars.             
              This work will help determine the mass ranges of stars that are                
              apt to lead to certain kinds of supernovae.  It will provide new               
              estimates of the dispersion of observable properties, such as                  
              luminosity, leading to a more confident use of supernovae as                   
              "standard candles" and to improved distances of external                       
              galaxies.
