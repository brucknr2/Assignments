Abstract    :
              The timing of radio pulses from "pulsars" has become important to              
              a number of areas in physics and astronomy, including the integrity            
              of time-keeping standards, the detection and measurement of the                
              effects of gravitational radiation, the measurement of shifts of               
              the crusts of neutron stars, and the understanding of how pulsars              
              are born, "reborn," and evolve with time.  The Principal                       
              Investigator (PI) is widely regarded as heading the group doing                
              much of the most precise work on the timing of pulsar pulses.                  
              He proposes to continue these observations using improved equipment            
              that he has designed at Arecibo and Green Bank radio observatories.            
              It is expected that this work will continue to be among the most               
              fundamental in linking observational astrophysics and tests of                 
              General Relativity.
