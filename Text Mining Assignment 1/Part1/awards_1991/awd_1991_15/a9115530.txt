Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              Recent studies on chemical scavenging, based on either modelling               
              or laboratory experiments, have suggested the importance of                    
              submicron particles.  Bacteria and colloids are two kinds of                   
              submicron particles deserving special attention.  The usual                    
              flow-through filtration using 0.4 um filters cannot separate                   
              these particles from solution cleanly.  Consequently, the                      
              interpretation of solution-particle and particle-particle                      
              interaction may be biased.  A cross-flow filtration method will                
              be employed to filter seawater samples sequentially through 1                  
              um, 0.1, and 1 nm filters, with the attempt of removing bacteria               
              by the second filter and colloids by the third filter.  Materials              
              retained by the second and the third filters will be                           
              characterized by their C/N ratios to assess the contribution of                
              colloids to the bacterial fraction.  Isotopes of Th(230Th, 232Th,              
              234Th) and 231Pa will be measured on these and sediment trap                   
              samples.  Except 234Th, which will be measured by B-counting, all              
              other nuclides in seawater samples will be measured by mass                    
              spectrometry.
