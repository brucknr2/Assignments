Abstract    :
              Rotation-powered pulsars are among the most enigmatic of celestial             
              objects.  Unlike most other stars the energy responsible for                   
              their pulsed and unpulsed radiation is derived from a complicated              
              coupling of their strong magnetic field and their rapid rotation.              
              In the proposed work the Principal Investigator (PI) will employ               
              a postdoctoral fellow in plasma physics, Dr. Brian Yang, to make               
              computer models of relativistic shocks that excite wispy structures            
              around some pulsars such as the Crab nebulae.  This work is                    
              expected to aid in our understanding of how magnetism and rotation             
              combine at high energies to produce radio pulses and x- and gamma-             
              ray radiation, both in the magnetospheres of pulsars and the                   
              centers of many "active" galaxies.
