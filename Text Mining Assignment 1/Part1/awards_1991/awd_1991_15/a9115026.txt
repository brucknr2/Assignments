Abstract    :
              The "metal poor" stars in the halo region of our Milky Way                     
              Galaxy reflect more closely than any known others the chemical                 
              abundance history of matter created at early epochs in the history             
              of the Universe.  Using a new echelle-CCD (Charged Coupled Device              
              detector) at McDonald Observatory, the Principal Investigator (PI)             
              plans a two-year program that will complete a survey of "heavy                 
              neutron capture" abundances (elements Ba through Yb in the periodic            
              table) among halo stars which was supported by an earlier NSF award            
              to him.  He will then undertake a survey of the abundances of all              
              accessible "ultrametal poor" stars.  This program exploits the                 
              recent detector developments which have permitted the PI to                    
              survey fainter and fainter stars in the halo and thereby push                  
              our knowledge of the Galaxy's chemical history back to the first               
              generation of stars, formed perhaps within a billion years of the              
              Big Bang.
