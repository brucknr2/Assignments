Abstract    :
              Forest trees have the potential to serve as substantial sinks for              
              rising atmospheric CO2 levels if nutrient limitations                          
              characteristic of most forest soils can be overcome.  Increased                
              carbon availability may stimulate a symbioltic relationship that               
              exists between tree roots and soil fungi with enhanced nutrient                
              acquisitions by trees as a result. My work investigates the                    
              possibility that physiological differencces between the two major              
              types if symbiotic soil fungi may lead to differential                         
              responses of tree species to CO2 enrichment.  Two of the major                 
              differences hypothesized to exist between the symbioses lie in 1)              
              the amount of carbon acquired by the tree that must be allocated               
              towards support of the fungal partner, and 2) the amount of                    
              nutrients taken up from the soil by the fungus and released to the             
              host tree.  Radiotracer techniqueswill be used to measure                      
              carbon allocation and phosphorus uptake in tree species engaging in            
              the two types of symbioses and growing at three levels of CO2                  
              enrichment. An understanding of mechanisms underlying the responses            
              of forest trees to environmental change will improve our ability to            
              predict forest ecosystems behavior in a CO2-enriched world.
