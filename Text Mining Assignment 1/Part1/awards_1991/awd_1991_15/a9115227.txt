Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The transport of sea-spray produced at the ocean surface will be               
              studied with a coupled Eulerian-Lagrangian numerical model. The                
              computed concentration profiles will be compared with observations.            
              The results of this research should lead to better estimates of                
              heat fluxes at the air-sea interface.
