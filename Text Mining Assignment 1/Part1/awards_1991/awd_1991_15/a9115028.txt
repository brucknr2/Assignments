Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program                 
              will help the Department of Chemistry at Michigan State                        
              University purchase laser equipment.  This equipment will be                   
              used in the following research activities:                                     
                                                                                             
              1.  Light Induced Charge Separation in Model and Biological                    
                  Systems                                                                    
                                                                                             
              2.  Charge Separated Electron Transfer in Biomimetic Model                     
                  Compounds                                                                  
                                                                                             
              3.  Solvent Dynamics of Non-Adiabatic Charge Separated Electron                
                  Transfer                                                                   
                                                                                             
              4.  Experimental and Theoretical Approaches to Specific                        
                  Solvation of Charge Separated Electron Transfer Complexes                  
                                                                                             
              5.  Proton Coupled Charge Separated Electron Transfer                          
                                                                                             
              Lasers emit a narrow beam of coherent, powerful and nearly                     
              monochromatic electromagnetic radiation.  This radiation is                    
              used in Chemistry to study a broad range of subjects, from the                 
              dynamics of proteins and nucleic acids to photoelectron                        
              transfer processes, and from interfacial chemistry to                          
              picosecond pulse shaping.  Lasers are also useful in optics,                   
              communications, and engineering.
