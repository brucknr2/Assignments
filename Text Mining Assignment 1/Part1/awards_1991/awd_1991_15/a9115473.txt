Abstract    :
                   This is a grant made under the USA/USSR program for                       
              Cooperation in Basic Scientific Research to further cooperation                
              between Drs. Hemmeter, Lazebnik and Woldar of the University of                
              Delaware and Dr. V. Ustimenko of the University of Kiev.  The                  
              principal investigators will study association schemes and Tits                
              geometries.  In particular, they hope to apply these ideas to                  
              extremal graph theory.                                                         
                   The research is in the general area of combinatorics.                     
              Combinatorics attempts to find efficient methods to study how                  
              discrete collections of objects can be organized.  It is                       
              extremely important to modern communications, for example the                  
              design of large networks as in telephone systems and the design                
              of algorithms in computer science.
