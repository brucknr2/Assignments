Abstract    :
              In this project, the PI's will continue to study the response of               
              the continental shelf surface boundary layer to atmospheric                    
              forcing through analysis of data from a major collaborative field              
              experiment, SMILE (Shelf Mixed Layer Experiment).  SMILE was                   
              conducted over the northern California shelf from mid-November,                
              1988 to mid-May, 1989 and included moored and land-based ocean and             
              atmospheric time series measurements and overflights with an                   
              instrumented aircraft.  Addressing several specific tasks will                 
              lead to a coherent picture of the seasonal behavior of the shelf               
              surface boundary layer and its response to atmospheric forcing.
