Abstract    :
              Fundamental research will be conducted on the structure of                     
              materials, especially structure at crystal surfaces.  The primary              
              theoretical tool will be realistic atomic-scale calculations                   
              carried out using a plane-wave pseudopotential approach to the                 
              local density approximation density-functional theory.  The recent             
              successful development of a new pseudopotential approach allows for            
              the efficient application of these methods to systems containing               
              first-row and transition-metal atoms.  Both "static" total energy              
              and structural refinement calculations, and finite temperature ab-             
              initio molecular dynamics calculations, will be done.  As in the               
              past, a primary emphasis will be on structure at crystal surfaces,             
              especially semiconductor surfaces.  Previous calculations of                   
              surface stress and studies of elastic properties at surfaces and               
              surface defects will be extended, with special emphasis on complex             
              stress-induced surface structure and on elastic interactions                   
              between surface defects such as steps.  New work will be done on               
              oxides of silicon, tungsten, silver and gold.  This involves study             
              of bulk liquid and solid structure using ab-initio molecular                   
              dynamics, as well as study of oxygen at semiconductor, metal and               
              metal-oxide surfaces.
