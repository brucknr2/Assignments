Abstract    :
              What are the social processes that                                             
              pattern disaster evacuation behavior                                           
              among transient populations?  Little                                           
              or no research has been directed                                               
              toward this question.  Transient                                               
              populations are defined as persons                                             
              who are not in the community where                                             
              they normally reside at the time                                               
              they initiate disaster evacuation                                              
              behavior.  There are at least four                                             
              sub-types:  tourists, business                                                 
              travellers, migrant workers, and                                               
              people in the process of relocating                                            
              (including the homeless).  The                                                 
              research has five objectives:  (1)                                             
              to describe the sequence of behavior                                           
              that culminates in actual evacuation                                           
              from disaster sites among transient                                            
              populations; (2) to describe the                                               
              range of variation that may exist                                              
              among these behavioral sequences                                               
              among population sub-types, urban-                                             
              rural event locations, and disaster                                            
              phases (i.e., pre or post-impact                                               
              evacuation); (3) to identify factors                                           
              that account for the variation in                                              
              these behavioral sequences, e.g.,                                              
              disaster warning receiver                                                      
              characteristics, warning message                                               
              characteristics, social group                                                  
              qualities, organizational qualities                                            
              and community characteristics;                                                 
              (4) document perceptions of                                                    
              transients who have been disaster                                              
              victims regarding evacuation                                                   
              procedures implemented by                                                      
              governmental agency representatives                                            
              and private sector organizational                                              
              executives; and (5) formulate policy                                           
              recommendations for emergency                                                  
              managers and business executives.                                              
              In accordance with disaster design                                             
              requirements, field interviews will                                            
              be conducted following major                                                   
              disasters resulting from earthquakes                                           
              and other agents in eight locations                                            
              wherein large numbers of transients                                            
              have evacuated.
