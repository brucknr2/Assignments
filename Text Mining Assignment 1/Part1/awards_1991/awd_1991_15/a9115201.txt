Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Both dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved organic                      
              nitrogen (DON) will be measured by the new high-temperature                    
              catalytic oxidation technique as part of the U.S. JGOFS                        
              Equatorial Pacific Program.  Survey measurements will provide                  
              critically needed data for constraining upper ocean models of                  
              the carbon flux and to determine if DOC and DON concentrations                 
              vary seasonally in the upper ocean at the equator.  On board                   
              incubation studies will (1) attempt to observe net production                  
              of dissolved organic matter by natural populations, (2) measure                
              bacterial oxidation rates and (3) by combining DOC and DON                     
              measurements, determine the C/N ratio of the biologically                      
              labile material.  The C/N ratio of the dissolved material will                 
              provide critically needed information regarding the nature of                  
              the biologically labile fraction of the dissolved organic                      
              carbon pool.  Post-cruise incubation studies will look at                      
              long-term stability of DOC and DON and whether the C/N ratio                   
              changes as bacteria remineralize organic matter.  Additional                   
              experiments will address problems of saving DOC and DON samples                
              for future analysis and whether changes occur during storage.                  
              These studies will be conducted in collaboration with other                    
              U.S. JGOFS investigators.
