Abstract    :
              It is proposed to determine the feasibility of a new method for                
              nondestructive evaluation of debonding in fibrous composite                    
              materials.  The method is based upon micromechanical predictions               
              which indicate that damage in the form of debonding in                         
              unidirectional metal matrix composites has no influence on the                 
              axial modulus in the fiber direction, but it does have an                      
              appreciable influence on the shear modulus for loading by pure                 
              longitudinal composites subjected to combined stress states                    
              remains an open question.  The proposed test method will exploit               
              the knowledge available from the micromechanical predictions to                
              assess debonding in silicon-carbide/titanium tubes through a                   
              series of carefully chosen sequential, multiaxial load                         
              increments.  The method is nondestructive in the sense that in -               
              situ stress and strain measurements provide the necessary data.                
              It is not necessary to remove the specimen form the test machine,              
              take edge replicas, use x-ray equipment, or conduct microscopic                
              studies on sectioned portions of the specimens.
