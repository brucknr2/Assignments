Abstract    :
                   This grant supports research to merge, reorganize, and                    
              expand several disparate planktonic foraminiferal abundance data               
              sets (and their associated environmental data) that have been                  
              derived from core-top sediment and sediment trap samples from                  
              around the world.  The long-term goals of the PIs are several                  
              fold:  (1) to produce a global, taxonomically consistent set of                
              foraminiferal assemblage samples (both the modern sediment and                 
              sediment-trap derived) that represent the full range of                        
              environmental and preservation conditions in the modern ocean:                 
              (2) to produce a data base of foraminiferal abundances,                        
              preservation states, and expand the related hydrographic data for              
              both sediments and sediment traps; (3) to use the data base to                 
              evaluate existing and develop new methods of paleoenvironmental                
              estimation; (4) to test the sensitivity for sediment-based                     
              environmental estimates to post-depositional alteration and                    
              seasonality of production; and (5) to evaluate the accuracy and                
              precision of sediment-based SST estimates.  The PIs will test the              
              accuracy and precision of the environmental  estimates in several              
              ways:  1) through the evaluation of environmental estimates made               
              on different subsets of the data; 2) through evaluation of                     
              different estimation techniques; and 3) through application of                 
              the sediment-derived environmental equations to sediment trap                  
              collection of foraminiferal assemblages.  The foraminiferal                    
              collections will be created at Brown University (core-top                      
              samples) and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (sediment trap               
              samples).  The numerical data base will be made available to the               
              paleoclimatology, paleoceanography and paleobiology research                   
              communities through the National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC).               
              This research is important because it is science-driven data and               
              information management directed at the production of a global                  
              paleoclimate climate base for global change studies.
