Abstract    :
              The objective is to investigate the effect of coupling                         
              between the flow and transport of a fluid, which is                            
              commercially available 'gasoline', in a porous medium                          
              consisting of Monterey No. 30 standard sand. A three                           
              dimensional finite element code will be developed based on                     
              (n+2) coupled differential equations for oil/water flow                        
              with n chemical species transport. The interphase mass                         
              transfer rate expression will be the focus of this research                    
              and parameterization of this by flume experiment. The                          
              computer code to be developed will have pre and post                           
              processors so that it can be readily utilized for field                        
              applications concerning problems of leaking underground                        
              storage tanks.
