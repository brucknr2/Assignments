Abstract    :
              This award is made as the starter grant increment of Dr.                       
              Jonathan Sweedler's Postdoctoral Fellowship in Chemistry Award                 
              in support of his research at the University of Illinois. The                  
              theme of the research is the analysis of neuropeptides using                   
              capillary zone electrophoresis with multichannel fluoresence                   
              detection. The research will develop new analytical                            
              methodology, capillary zone electrophoresis with laser-induced                 
              fluorescence detection, to assay neuropeptides released from                   
              single neurons in the marine mollusk Aplysia californica.                      
              Experiments will perform measurements in the low zeptomole                     
              range. This represents a thousand-fold increase in sensitivity                 
              over conventional sampling techniques.

              The development of this ultrasensitive technique will give the                 
              cellular biochemist the ability to unravel the complex nature                  
              of peptides as neurotransmitters.
