Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Several lines of research on the nitrogen cycle of surface waters              
              point to the importance of dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) in                 
              microbial nitrogen transformations.  The disappearance rate of                 
              dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) often exceeds the assimilation              
              rate of DIN into particles in tracer experiments.  The "missing" 15N           
              is a common phenomenon of such experiments and has been reported               
              for all forms of inorganic nitrogen (nitrate, ammonium, etc).  The             
              missing nitrogen and the missing 15N are evidence for the existence            
              of another labile compartment in the nitrogen cycle of the euphotic            
              zone: dissolved organic nitrogen (DON).  The evidence suggests that            
              the missing 15N, the missing nitrogen and the new DON of Suzuki et             
              al.  (1985) are all related.  This study will quantify the role of             
              DON in nitrogen cycling in the euphotic zone by tracing the                    
              pathways of DIN through the food web using 15N tracer techniques.              
              Using size fractionation, time course and conventional experiments,            
              this study will investigate the concentration, production rate and             
              isotopic enrichment of the DON pool.  The experiments are proposed             
              for the low nutrient surface waters of the Southern California                 
              Bight and for the more productive Monterey Bay, but the phenomenon             
              is of wide generality and we expect that the results will be useful            
              far beyond these geographical locations.
