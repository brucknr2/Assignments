Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              It is proposed to conduct a series of numerical simulations to try             
              to understand and quantify how the chaotic behavior of high                    
              frequency underwater acoustic waves affects our ability to predict             
              the ray trajectories of the corresponding lower frequency                      
              wavefield.
