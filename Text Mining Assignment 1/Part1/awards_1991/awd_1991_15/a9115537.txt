Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project explores a new immunomagnetic method for rapidly and              
              efficiently separating cells or biological macromolecules from a               
              mixture.  T                                                                    
              he method uses vesicles with antibodies Fc-receptors attached                  
              on them and with magnetic nanoparticles encapsulated within                    
              the aqueous vesicles cores.  The vesicles then bind                            
              selectively on the antibodies attached to specific cells,                      
              which are then separated magnetically.  The magnetic vesicles                  
              are separated from the cells and can be 'recycled'.  A second                  
              method using ferritin molecules conjugated with Fc-receptors,                  
              rather than vesicles with Fc-receptors, is also explored for                   
              comparison.  A model system of sheep red blood cells and                       
              chicken red blood cells has been successfully separated.  The                  
              mechanism of binding is investigated by light and electron                     
              microscopy.  Various separation schemes are explored.  The                     
              results are potentially applicable to clinical separations -                   
              e.g. cancer cells from healthy cells, - biomedical research,                   
              and biotechnology.
