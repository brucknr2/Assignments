Abstract    :
                   This award supports the cross-disciplinary efforts and the                
              development of research collaboration involving quantitative                   
              modelling in the geosciences.  In particular the mathematician                 
              and the atmospheric scientist will focus their attention on                    
              pseudo-parabolic partial differential equation models for                      
              experimentally evaluable aspects of electrification and                        
              lightning.
