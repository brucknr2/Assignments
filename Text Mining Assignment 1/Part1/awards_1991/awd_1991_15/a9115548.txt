Abstract    :
              Research will be undertaken which will assist in the design of new             
              materials with desired physical properties.  This research will be             
              based on understanding the factors which influence the structure               
              and electronic properties of electroactive polymers.  The first                
              part of the work deals with the "band structure engineering" of                
              electroactive polymers.  This is made possible by a combination of             
              accurate total energy and gradient calculations first leading to               
              reliable predictions of the geometric structure which is not                   
              readily available from experimental data.  Based on the established            
              structures, accurate band structure predictions can be carried out.            
              The effects of non-planarity, three-dimensional, interactions and              
              soliton lattices are taken into account.  Variations of chemical               
              composition will be analyzed.  In the second part of the research,             
              the vibrational spectra of conjugated polymers will be calculated.             
              The approach, which relies on empirical scaling calculations on                
              monomers and dimers but does not use empirical data from the                   
              polymer, should make experimental infrared and Raman spectra much              
              more useful in determining structural features of a large class of             
              important materials for which present structural data is either                
              incomplete or impossible to obtain.
