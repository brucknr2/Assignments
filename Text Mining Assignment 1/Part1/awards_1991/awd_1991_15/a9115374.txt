Abstract    :
                   Dr. Peter Sampou is a Research Associate at the Horn Point                
              Environmental Lab on the eastern shore of Chesapeake Bay.  The                 
              Lab is one three campuses of the University of Maryland's Center               
              for Environmental and Estuarine Studies.  Dr. Sampou proposes                  
              acquisition of a Coulometric TCO2 (total carbon dioxide)                       
              analyzer, which will complement the dissolved oxygen/carbon                    
              analyzer recently acquired by the Lab.  The analyses performed by              
              this instrument are essential to studies of carbon flow through                
              the estuarine environment.                                                     
                   As fertilizers and other nutrients are fed into coastal                   
              waters, plant life blooms and may deplete the water of dissolved               
              oxygen that is essential for animal life.  This process of                     
              eutrophication threatens the commercial value of estuaries and                 
              diminishes their overall environmental quality.  The carbon                    
              dioxide analyzer will greatly enhance many ongoing studies of the              
              Chesapeake Bay at Horn Point Environmental Lab, and will add to                
              our understanding of the fragile coastal margin.
