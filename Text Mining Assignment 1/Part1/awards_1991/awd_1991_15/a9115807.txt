Abstract    :
              This award from the U.S.-Argentina Cooperative Science                         
              Program supports cooperative research in physics to be                         
              conducted by Dr. Ezra T. Newman of the Department of                           
              Physics and Astronomy at the University of Pittsburgh                          
              and Dr. Karlos Kozameh of the faculty of Mathematics,                          
              Astronomy and Physics at the University of Cordoba,                            
              Argentina.  The focus of the project is to probe a                             
              novel and unconventional viewpoint towards geometry                            
              and the Einstein field equations of general                                    
              relativity.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              The research relies on the reformulation of general                            
              relativity that allows the equations to be split into                          
              two parts, where one part allows the D'Adhemar-like                            
              formulation while the other part yields equations for                          
              the determination of the light cones. The award will                           
              foster continuation of a productive U.S.-Argentina                             
              collaboration.
