Abstract    :
                   The long-term objective of this project is to improve                     
              understanding of the kinematics and dynamics of continental                    
              collision and associated mountain-building processes along the                 
              Alpine-Himalayan collision zone.  The primary scientific goals of              
              this project include: (i) comparison of baseline measurements made             
              independently by Soviet and American observation systems, (ii)                 
              measurement of internal deformation of the major crustal blocks of             
              the region, (iii) monitoring strain accumulation and release along             
              the major fault systems of Central Asia, (iv) evaluation of                    
              preseismic(?), coseismic, and post-seismic deformation associated              
              with major crustal earthquakes, and (v) determination of present-              
              day relative movements between the Indian and Eurasian plates.
