Abstract    :
              The specific objectives of this research are two-fold: 1. to                   
              develop a working observational procedure for practical field                  
              settlement determination, and design of structures founded on                  
              highly compressible soils, and 2. to test a newly developed thermal            
              precompression concept in the field as a practical means of rapid              
              in situ improvement of fine-grained soils.  A model based on the               
              theory of rate processes will be applied to the early settlement               
              records of two test embankments on soft ground.  A work                        
              observational procedure will be developed to predict future creep              
              settlement under given stress and temperature changes in the field.
