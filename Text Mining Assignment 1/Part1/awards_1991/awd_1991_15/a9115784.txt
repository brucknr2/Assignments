Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  The geochemistry of Be and B in marine sediments will be                  
              studied, with particular attention to sediments in subduction                  
              zones.  The purpose is to determine the intial inputs of Be/B                  
              into the subduction zones.  This will include a study of                       
              dissolbed boron in pore fluids from different environments, a                  
              study of the istopic geochemistry of boron from sediments from                 
              two subduction zones (ODP sites 671 and 672 in the Nankai                      
              Trough) and a study of boron geochemistry from cores that have                 
              undergone temperatures of well over 100'C.
