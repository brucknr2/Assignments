Abstract    :
                   This action would provide funds for continued research in                 
              elementary particle physics.  The scientific staff consists of                 
              three faculty, four research associates and four graduate                      
              students.  They conduct experiments at the accelerator facility                
              at Fermilab.  Their research is in two broad categories:                       
                   Operation and upgrade of the Collider Detector Facility at                
              Fermilab to study proton-antiproton collisions at two trillion                 
              electron volts.  The scientific goals include a search for the                 
              top quark, precise measurements of the parameters of the                       
              electroweak theory, accumulation of a large number of B- Mesons                
              to measure the parameters describing transitions among quarks                  
              via the weak interaction and exploratory studies of the highest                
              energy region available today.  This effort is conducted with an               
              international collaboration in which many other NSF supported                  
              scientists participate.                                                        
                   A series of experiments studying the breaking of the                      
              symmetry known as "charge conjugation - parity".  The                          
              experiments all involve the decays of K - mesons.  Experiments                 
              E773 and E799, proposal P832 and the proposed facility "Kaons at               
              the Main Injector" are all dedicated to these studies.  The kaon               
              program is led by NSF supported scientists.                                    
                   This work is a continuation of research supported under                   
              grant PHY 8815915.
