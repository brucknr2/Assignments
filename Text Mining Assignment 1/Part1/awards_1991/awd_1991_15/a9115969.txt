Abstract    :
                   The optimum demodulator for spread-spectrum multiple access               
              systems is known to be extremely complex and not practical for                 
              implementation except for a very limited number of users.                      
              Several suboptimum receivers have been found to achieve near                   
              optimal performance (in the absence of coding) with much reduced               
              complexity.  In addition, it is known that for spread-spectrum                 
              systems coding can significantly improve the performance in a                  
              jamming and multiple-access environment.  This project is an                   
              investigation of the performance of coded spread-spectrum                      
              multiple-access systems with various types of near optimal, but                
              reduced complexity, decoders and demodulators.  The aim is to                  
              design reduced complexity decoders and demodulators that achieve               
              a favorable tradeoff in complexity and performance.
