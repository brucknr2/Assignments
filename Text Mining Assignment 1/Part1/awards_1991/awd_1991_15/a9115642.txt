Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Pi of this project has devised a technique for estimating                  
              virtually the instantaneous rate of production for eucaryotic                  
              marine microbial organo-osmotrophs (eumycotic fungi), analogous to             
              those previously available for procaryotic organo-osmotrophs.  This            
              method, which is in in the Journal ECOLOGY, represents a                       
              technological breakthrough; it promises to permit the first                    
              estimates of fungal productivity in ocean-edge ecosystems, the                 
              portion of the marine environment wherein fungi are likely to have             
              their greatest impact on carbon flow, from vascular plants to                  
              marine food webs.  The technique (abbreviated as Ac-ERG) involves              
              measuring the incorporation of radio-labeled acetate into the                  
              (nearly) uniquely fungal sterol, ergosterol.  The Ac-ERG technique             
              is unseasoned; this project will polish it via experimentation with            
              several of its facets, to learn its strengths and weaknesses and               
              better define its inter-pretability and range of aptness.  Two                 
              conspicuous limitations of the Ac-ERG technique are:  1)                       
              restriction to submerged samples (much of the decomposition of                 
              shoots of intertidal plants occurs while shoots are out of the                 
              water); 2) in-applicability for marine oomycotes (very common                  
              protoctistan decomposers of marine leaf litter; they do not                    
              synthesize ergosterol).  This project will attempt to try to expand            
              the utility of Ac-ERG technique by modifying it to remove these two            
              constraints through: 1) presenting the radio-acetate to the sample             
              in a volatilized state; 2) finding neutral lipids peculiar to                  
              oomycotes and following radio-acetate flow to them.  The results of            
              this research should be a more powerful, more durable, and better              
              understood means of estimating marine eucaryotic organo-osmotrophic            
              productivity.
