Abstract    :
                   This grant supports a program of research in nuclear                      
              astrophysics, intermediate energy electro-nuclear physics, and                 
              the nuclear theory applied to these areas, at the Kellogg                      
              Radiation Laboratory at California Institute of Technology.                    
              The research is carried out primarily by a group of six                        
              faculty, a senior research fellow, four postdoctoral                           
              associates, and ten graduate students, and four undergraduate                  
              students.  The nuclear astrophysics research utilizes the                      
              in-house accelerator system to study nuclear reactions related                 
              to synthesis of the elements and burning processes in stars.                   
              The intermediate energy physics experiments are instrumented                   
              at California Institute of Technology and carried out at                       
              facilities such as the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, the                 
              MIT Bates Laboratory, and HERA in Hamburg, Germany.  Both                      
              undergraduate and graduate students are active participants in                 
              all aspects of the research activity.
