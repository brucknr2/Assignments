Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                  This award provides funds to establish a computer network                 
              linking researchers in Sociology and affiliated programs at the                
              University of Wyoming to a micro-computer laboratory, a mainframe              
              computer, and to each other's work stations.  The proposal was                 
              submitted to the Instrumentation and Instrument Development                    
              Program.  The computer network will greatly facilitate the                     
              sociological research currently taking place at the university by              
              providing researchers joint access to  large scale datasets, easy              
              communication with each other, and much better opportunitites for              
              training graduate students//
