Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal examines three ternary aluminum alloys and one                   
              quartenary aluminum alloy system.  Thermodynamic modeling and phase            
              diagram calculations are coupled to solidification modeling to                 
              determine paths of solidification.  Alloys of interest to the study            
              are aluminum-rich alloys of Al-Mg-Cu, Al-Mg-Zn, Al-Zn-Cu, and Al-              
              Mg-Zn-Cu.  The approach combines thermodynamic modeling and                    
              experimental measurements of phase equilibria.  A modified Schiel              
              model is employed that accounts for back diffusion in determining              
              the solidification path.  Results from directional solidification              
              experiments are compared with the calculations to improve the                  
              models.                                                                        
              %%%                                                                            
              A knowledge of the thermodynamics and phase equilibria of multi-               
              component alloys is vital to the development of new alloys.  This              
              research expands basic understanding in this field for model                   
              aluminum alloys systems that also have commercial significance.
