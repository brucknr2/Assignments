Abstract    :
              In this Experimental Physical Chemistry program (Chemistry                     
              Division) project, Professor Mark Berg (University of Texas,                   
              Austin) will use picosecond laser techniques (time resolved                    
              hole burning and Raman echoes) to study the dynamics of solvent                
              interactions with reacting, non-polar solute molecules in                      
              liquids. Effects of solvation on electron and vibrational                      
              states, local diffusional motion near solutes, solute-solvent                  
              thermal energy transfer, and correlated solvent motion will be                 
              studied.                                                                       
              %%%                                                                            
              Professor Berg will use ultra fast laser pulses to directly                    
              observe effects of solvent on chemical reactions in liquids.                   
              The new methods developed as part of this study are important                  
              because they can be applied to a much wider class of reactions                 
              than was possible previously.
