Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The uptake of stable isotopes and trace metals into the calcite                
              shells of four paleo-ecologically important species of living                  
              planktonic foraminifera will be studied.  Specific objectives                  
              include quantifying the effects of symbiont photosynthesis and                 
              foraminifera respiration on isotopic composition within the shell,             
              and determining whether incorporation of trace metals is                       
              proportional to seawater concentrations and to what extent                     
              temperature may affect this incorporation.
