Abstract    :
                   A critical factor in data storage technology is coding.                   
              Modulation codes are used to convert the data to a waveform                    
              suitable for the storage medium while error control codes are used             
              to ensure reliability.  Most coding schemes are based on using two             
              independently designed codes, one for error control and the other              
              for modulation.  Although the two codes may each be optimal with               
              regard to its design goal, the combined code may be far from                   
              optimal as an overall code.  The aim of this project is to study               
              combined coding techniques that achieve the required error control             
              and modulation properties by viewing the two properties as                     
              inseparable. The goal is to develop new codes that are more                    
              efficient than the overall codes currently used and to explore the             
              ultimate limits on performance which can be obtained by combined               
              coding techniques.
