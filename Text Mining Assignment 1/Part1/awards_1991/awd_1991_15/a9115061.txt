Abstract    :
              The supernova explosion of a massive star provides a rich                      
              variety of information to us about the production of new                       
              heavy elements in the Universe.   To interpret this information                
              from spectroscopic and light variability observations requires                 
              an understanding of how various atomic ions are excited by both                
              light absorbed from the supernova and collisions of electrons;                 
              this general subject is known as non-LTE physics.  The PI has                  
              spent a year in Munich to adapt the world's most sophisticated                 
              non-LTE computer program for dynamic atmospheres of hot stars to               
              the context of the supernova explosion problem.  This work has                 
              resulted in an improved ability to compute synthetic spectra                   
              based only on input physics and to attempt to match these                      
              predictions with observed spectra.  This work is expected                      
              to greatly improve our understanding the nucleosynthetic                       
              history of heavy elements both just prior to and during the                    
              supernova explosion.  Eventually, this effort will lead to an                  
              understanding of the origin of the heavy elements (e.g. iron)                  
              that are major constituents of the Earth.
