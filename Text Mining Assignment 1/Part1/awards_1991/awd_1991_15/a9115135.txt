Abstract    :
                   Ronald Lawrenz is the Director of the St. Croix Watershed                 
              Research Station, which is located near St. Paul along the St.                 
              Croix River and operated by the Science Museum of Minnesota.  The              
              St. Croix River is recognized under the National Wild and Scenic               
              Rivers Act, and is therefore an important resource for research                
              and public education.  The Station was established in 1989 and                 
              has undergone significant growth in the number of research                     
              projects and long-term ecological monitoring programs facilitated              
              by the Station.  Mr. Lawrenz has planned expansion of the                      
              Station's facilities to serve the growing use of the Station by                
              research scientists.  These improvements include installation of               
              a meteorological monitoring station, and development of a clearer              
              research identity for the Station through workshops that bring                 
              together ecological scientists in the regions.                                 
                   The planned meteorological monitoring station will initiate               
              a long-term data record that will be of value to countless future              
              research projects, ranging from wildlife management to global                  
              climate change.  The planning workshops will help to guide the                 
              future growth trajectory of the Station.  The St. Croix Watershed              
              is an area with potential for research projects with national and              
              international implications.  These improvements will promote the               
              Station's rapid growth and future success.
