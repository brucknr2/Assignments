Abstract    :
                   Dr. Robert Whitlatch is Head of the Department of Marine                  
              Sciences at the University of Connecticut.  He proposes                        
              construction of a controlled-condition seawater system at the                  
              University's Avery Point campus at Groton.  This seawater system               
              will support experimental studies of marine and estuarine organisms            
              under controlled manipulations of water filtration, temperature,               
              and salinity.                                                                  
                   The proposed seawater system for experimental research will               
              be a unique facility on Long Island Sound, and will attract                    
              research scientists from a broad region.  Studies of recruitment               
              and population growth will take on added dimensions as a result of             
              access to the proposed facility.  These studies will address a                 
              range of topics from basic marine biology and physiology, to the               
              effects of society on marine habitats, to the impact and control               
              of fouling organisms on human-built structures.
