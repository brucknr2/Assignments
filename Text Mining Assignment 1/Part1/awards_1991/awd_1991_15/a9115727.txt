Abstract    :
              This is an SGER project.  A graphical programming method is                    
              proposed for single and multiphase flows in two and three-                     
              dimensions.  The flow domain is drawn using spatial vectors,                   
              which provide the input data for any complex flow situation.  The              
              information may be directly visualized on a computer screen by                 
              using a limited set of graphics functions, with single or                      
              multiple colors.  The method reduces significantly the                         
              programming time, uses much less computer memory, and allows for               
              modeling with increased localized resolution, easy and fast                    
              interactive access to data.  The method particularly useful for                
              multidomain flow problems, such as multiphase flows.  The method               
              is simple, make use of the existing hardware,a nd may lead to                  
              good performances in multidimensional complex flows.  The                      
              proposed approach is suitable for the workstation environment.
