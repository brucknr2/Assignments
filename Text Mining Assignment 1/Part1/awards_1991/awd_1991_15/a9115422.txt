Abstract    :
              Tsunamis are ocean waves generated by an impulsive geophysical                 
              event, such as an earthquake.  Historically, Hawaii and Alaska                 
              have been the areas of the U.S. affected by tsunami impact.  The               
              objective of this research program is to study the runup of a                  
              tsunami onto a coastline, the overland flow of tsunamis, and                   
              their interaction with structures located in the nearshore                     
              regions.  Specifically, it is investigating:                                   
                                                                                             
                   (1) The shape, kinematic characteristics and shoreward limit              
                       of propagation of the overland flow of the surge which                
                       may develop at the shoreline due to the tsunami.                      
                                                                                             
                   (2) The determination of the forces and pressures imposed on              
                       two-dimensional and three-dimensional structures by an                
                       impinging surge.                                                      
                                                                                             
              This investigation is directed toward the mitigation of tsunami                
              hazards by contributing to the knowledge needed:  to improve                   
              tsunami warning systems, to estimate the overland flow of a                    
              tsunami-induced surge, and to design structures located near the               
              shoreline which could be impacted by such a surge.
