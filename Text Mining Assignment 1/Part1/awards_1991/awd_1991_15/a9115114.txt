Abstract    :
              This grant will allow five astronomers at four primarily                       
              undergraduate institutions to work on a series of problems                     
              requiring extensive photometric observations without requiring                 
              neglect of their teaching duties.  This will be accomplished by                
              use of a telescope which operates under computer control without               
              requiring an observer.  This type of telescope is revolutionizing              
              the observations of certain types of objects which require an                  
              extensive series of observations.  These objects have traditionally            
              been neglected since most astronomers have not had the time                    
              required to observe them properly.                                             
                                                                                             
              The schools involved in the Consortium are The College of                      
              Charleston, The Citadel, the University of Nevada-Las Vegas, and               
              Villanova University.  The projects to be undertaken include                   
              observations of solar type stars, multi-mode variable stars,                   
              chemically peculiar stars of the upper main sequence, Ursa Majoris             
              Stream stars, apsidal motion of eclipsing binaries and Be stars.               
              Additionally observations of standard stars will be used to improve            
              various standard systems.
