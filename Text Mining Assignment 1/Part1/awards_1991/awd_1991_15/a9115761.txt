Abstract    :
                   This project is concerned with two mathematical                           
              subdisciplines: model theory and universal algebra.  Until                     
              recently there were two distinct branches of model theory:                     
              classification theory and model theoretic algebra.  In the past                
              decade, the boundary between these two areas has become blurred.               
              Algebraic techniques have become a necessary ingredient in most                
              of the exciting recent results in model theory.  In the last                   
              fifteen years universal algebra has acquired two powerful new                  
              tools:  commutator theory and tame congruence theory.  These have              
              been used to settle a number of problems, including questions in               
              decidability.  There are also several important intersections                  
              between model theory and universal algebra.                                    
                   This project will support a special year in model theory and              
              universal algebra to be held at the University of Illinois at                  
              Chicago in 1991-92.  The year will feature long term visits by                 
              internationally prominent researchers and short term visits by                 
              leading experts in the fields.
