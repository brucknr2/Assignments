Abstract    :
              A research  group at Arizona State University proposes to                      
              purchase an element/isotope analysis system for use in                         
              environmental biology.  Environmental biology is a critical                    
              area for development because of a rapidly expanding                            
              population and associated environmental stress in the                          
              Southwest.   The proposed         instrumentation will                         
              support studies of subjects such as: stream- riparian and                      
              lake-ecosystems, focusing on nutrient cycling and                              
              transformation; comparative physiology research on insect                      
              nitrogen excretion; and host nutritional quality and                           
              reproductive success in natural populations of cactophilic                     
              flies.  The University will support this endeavor by                           
              providing a technician dedicated to the laboratory, space                      
              and necessary improvements in the space,  maintenance costs,                   
              and cost-sharing on capital purchases.  The projects are all                   
              characterized by substantial involvement of student                            
              researchers (graduates and undergraduate).  This                               
              instrumentation will allow a significant improvement in                        
              training of these students.
