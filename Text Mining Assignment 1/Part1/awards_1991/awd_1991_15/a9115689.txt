Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Using a combination of mathematical analysis and numerical                     
              calculations, a study will be conducted of particle transport                  
              in surface wave induced oscillatory boundary layers over a                     
              sediment bed.  An existing theory of homogenization will be                    
              extended and applied to this problem.  The theory deals with                   
              physical phenomena involving several widely different scales.                  
              In this case, two very different scales are the flow forcing                   
              length and the suspended particle layer thickness. Dispersion                  
              coefficients and dispersion patterns will be determined, with                  
              forcing from both waves and tidal action.                                      
                                                                                             
              The research will have impact on the more reliable prediction                  
              of coastal sediment transport, relevant to beach protection                    
              and bay and harbor silting.
