Abstract    :
              Adaptive critic methods, and they alone in the                                 
              current neural-network literature, hold the potential                          
              of providing neural nets that to some extent mimic                             
              a very important aspect of intelligence - the ability                          
              to learn about some part of the world through                                  
              observation and, though trial and error, to discover                           
              how to successfully cope with that world.  With                                
              several networks interacting with each other they                              
              come somewhat closer to brainlike activities than                              
              do most other models.  There are risks, however, in                            
              this approach, as there are heuristic aspects of the                           
              formulas to be implemented and it is impossible to                             
              rigorously analyze the performance of these                                    
              heuristic due to the massive parallel and nonlinear                            
              nature of the networks.  This research will involve                            
              computational experiments with various problems                                
              that are easily (either analytically or                                        
              computationally) solvable using conventional                                   
              dynamic programming to evaluate the potential,                                 
              and problems, of adaptive critic methods.
