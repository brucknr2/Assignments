Abstract    :
              This research has a three-fold goal: (1) to develop tools for building         
              intelligent systems that require tightly coupled logical and numerical         
              computation; (2) to apply mathematical programming and constrained             
              optimization techniques to do logical inference and, (3) to test the           
              efficacy of highly parallel constraint logic programming systems in            
              this arena.  Constraint logic programming (CLP) provides a natural             
              paradigm to link logical computation and numerical computation.  This          
              research is based on compact CLP languages which are supersets of              
              linear and integer programming and support the data structures                 
              necessary for mathematical programming rather than on constraint based         
              extensions to Prolog.  The fit between the applications and constraint         
              logic programming opens up several avenues for parallelism, since              
              logic programming systems have direct hooks into both or-parallelism           
              and and-parallelism.
