Abstract    :
                   The Organization for Tropical Studies (OTS) is a consortium               
              of 46 U.S. and 6 Costa Rican organizations that operates several               
              field stations in the tropical forests of Costa Rica.  The PI,                 
              Executive Director of OTS, proposes to acquire additional basic                
              laboratory equipment for the La Selva Field Station and the                    
              recently established facility at Las Cruces.  In addition, Dr.                 
              Stone has planned the construction of family housing for visiting              
              scientists at Las Cruces (one duplex housing unit) and La Selva                
              (two duplex units).                                                            
                   The proposed housing construction will greatly expand the                 
              number of investigators who can initiate research at the                       
              Stations, and will accommodate younger scientists with small                   
              children as well as investigators with physical disabilities.                  
              More basic research equipment will allow the use of the Station                
              by students and researchers to continue to expand.  Continued                  
              growth and improvement in OTS is critical to the involvement of                
              U.S. scientists and policy makers in tropical regions.
