Abstract    :
              The project involves the development of a facility to enable the               
              design and prototyping of systems that offer a major increase in               
              functionality and performance relative to current generation                   
              systems.  Performance increases are achieved by developing design              
              tools that apply leading-edge semiconductor and packaging                      
              technologies by incorporating fabrication and testing constraints              
              as an integral part of the design tradeoff process, and by                     
              developing innovative new hardware/software structures for                     
              important classes of systems.  The project exploits the projected              
              increases in both complexity and speed of semiconductor                        
              technologies due to further decreases in feature sizes and utilizes            
              MCM (Multi-chip Module) packaging technologies to enable system                
              realization .
