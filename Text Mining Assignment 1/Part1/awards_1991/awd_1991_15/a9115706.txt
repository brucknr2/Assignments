Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Biological N2 fixation is a biogeochemically unique and                        
              potentially important "new" nitrogen input in chronically N                    
              deficient marine waters.  Estimates of N2 fixation inputs                      
              (relative to ecosystem N demand) range from less than 2% in                    
              planktonic to at least 20-30% in certain benthic systems.  A                   
              persistent problem with these assessments is our rudimentary                   
              knowledge of relevant and active microbial diazotrophs                         
              (cyanobacteria, bacteria), their location and interactions, the                
              impacts of environmental constraints on and resultant spatial-                 
              temporal heterogeneity of N2 fixation.  In prior work Dr. Paerl                
              and co-workers applied immunochemical, electrochemical,                        
              cytochemical and microautoradiographic detection and                           
              characterization of N2 fixers in diverse benthic and planktonic                
              habitats.  Results indicate the presence and periodic                          
              preponderance of microheterotrophic diazotrophs.  This poorly                  
              recognized and underassessed group exhibited relatively high                   
              rates of N2 fixation in oxygen-deplete surficial, aggregate-                   
              associated microzones, including detritus, mats, reefs,                        
              biofilms and epiphytic habitats.  N2 fixation in these habitats                
              appears to function in a consortial manner; that is, the                       
              presence and magnitudes of N2 fixation are reliant on specific                 
              intact microbial groups acting together in a highly coordinated                
              and interdependent manner.                                                     
                                                                                             
              In this research, Dr. Paerl will investigate the dynamics                      
              of and environmental controls on consortial N2 fixation.  He                   
              will apply cell-specific immunochemical probing, microchemical                 
              sensing and microautoradiography to: 1) elucidate physical,                    
              chemical and biotic factors affecting the establishment and                    
              maintenance of consortial N2 fixation, and 3) evaluate                         
              environmental controls on consortial N2 fixation in relation to                
              their impacts on "new" N inputs on larger scale ecosystem, and                 
              ultimately global, levels.
