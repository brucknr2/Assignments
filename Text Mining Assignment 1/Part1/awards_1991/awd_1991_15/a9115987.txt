Abstract    :
              This project addresses the growth and processing of metastable                 
              ultrathin epitaxial films and layered structures of transition                 
              metals.  Stuctural metastability  is achieved by epitaxial growth              
              on selected single-crystal substrates, and on designed buffer-layer            
              films created by epitaxial growth of metals on semiconductors.  The            
              resesarch employs low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), angle                
              resolved photoelectron diffraction, photoelectron holography with              
              synchrotron radiation.  The magnetic properties of the films will              
              be characterized by in-situ magnetoresistance measurements and by              
              the surface magnetooptical Kerr effect.  The research will address             
              fundamental aspects of the photoelectron diffraction phenomena as              
              well as practical applications of these techniques to determine the            
              structures of the films.
