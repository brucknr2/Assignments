Abstract    :
                   This award supports the cross-disciplinary efforts and the                
              development of research collaboration involving quantitative                   
              modelling in the geosciences.  In particular the statistician and              
              atmospheric scientist will focus their collaboration on                        
              statistical modelling of transient, nonstationary atmospheric                  
              phenomena that are partially driven by periodic processes.
