Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research in             
              astrophysics between W. Lothar Frommhold of the University of                  
              Texas at Austin and Jean-Pierre Bouanich and others at the                     
              University of Paris (South).  The objective of their research is to            
              improve understanding of the physics of collision induced                      
              absorption processes at the fundamental molecular level.  Dr.                  
              Frommhold is a recognized leader in the theoretical aspects of                 
              collision induced absorption.  His group in Texas has produced                 
              computations of absorption spectra of hydrogen molecular pairs.                
              This is complemented by the French group's excellent experimental              
              record in laboratory measurements of collision induced absorption.             
              The Texas group proposes to compare their theoretical results with             
              the high quality measurements of the French group.  In the                     
              process, significant and reliable new data will be obtained.                   
                                                                                             
              The project is of major interest to astrophysicists specializing in the        
              atmosphere of outer planets and cool stars where hydrogen and                  
              helium are major elements.  The verification of the theoretical                
              work in collision induced absorption will advance our                          
              understanding of the process and its application to star formation in          
              collapsing clouds.
