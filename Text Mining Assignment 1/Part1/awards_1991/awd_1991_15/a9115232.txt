Abstract    :
                   Dr. Kevin Eckelbarger is the Director of the University                   
              ofMaine's Darling Marine Center on the Gulf of Maine.  The                     
              Centerprovides ready access to a variety of shoreline and                      
              marinehabitats, and has an active program of research use by                   
              residentand visiting investigators.  Dr. Eckelbarger proposes                  
              acquisitionof a small boat for sampling in shallow water                       
              habitats,construction of a storage/staging facility for SCUBA                  
              equipmentand boat repair, and renovation of two buildings for use              
              asoffice/lab combinations and for visiting faculty apartments.                 
                   The proposed improvements to the Darling Marine Center                    
              willhave a significant and beneficial impact on the resident                   
              andvisiting students and scientists working there.  The                        
              proposedbuilding renovaton will expand the Center's capacity, and              
              theboat and diving facilities will increase access to                          
              marinehabitats.
