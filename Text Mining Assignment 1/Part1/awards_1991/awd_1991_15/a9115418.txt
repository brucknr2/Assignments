Abstract    :
                   The shape of small metal clusters is determined by forces                 
              intermediate between those of the isolated molecule and the                    
              extended solid.  Particle shape plays an important role in                     
              surface interactions and catalytic behavior.  This project will                
              apply microwave-optical double resonance spectroscopy to                       
              determine the nature and extent of Jahn-Teller distortions in the              
              vibronic spectra of small metal clusters.  These experimental                  
              measurements will be a rigorous benchmark against which present                
              theoretical calculations will be evaluated.  This project is                   
              jointly supported by the Physics and Chemistry Divisions of NSF.
