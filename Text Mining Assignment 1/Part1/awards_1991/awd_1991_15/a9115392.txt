Abstract    :
              The Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory of Columbia                          
              University will continue shipboard technician activities                       
              associated with the research vessel MAURICE EWING, a 239-foot                  
              vessel that is owned and operated by the University.  A                        
              significant portion of Lamont's ship operating schedule in                     
              recent years and again in during 1991 is in support of NSF-                    
              sponsored research projects.  The Shipboard Technician                         
              Program has two components: an at-sea component and an ashore                  
              component.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              The at-sea component consists of instructing scientific                        
              personnel in the use of shared shipboard equipment;                            
              maintenance, repair, and calibration of scientific instru-                     
              mentation; instruction and supervision of deck operations;                     
              and providing logistics assistance to on-coming and off-going                  
              scientific parties.  On shore activities include maintenance,                  
              repair, and calibration of shared use seagoing equipment and                   
              assisting scientific personnel in preparing for field work on                  
              the vessel.  Shipboard technicians funded by this award have                   
              broad responsibilities for providing the coordination and                      
              assistance needed for the successful completion of research                    
              projects at sea.  The level of activity and amount of support                  
              are closely related to the size and capability of the vessel,                  
              and its scientific outfit and capability.
