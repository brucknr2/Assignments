Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
                                                                                            
              An analytical system and sampling procedures have been developed               
              for the determination of pore water DOC, using a modification of               
              the high temperature, platinum catalyzed oxidation method of                   
              Sugimura and Suzuki (1988).  This approach employs                             
              chromatographic CO2 separation, and allows quantification by                   
              flame ionization detection or alteratively, isolation of the DOC               
              derived CO2 for isotopic analysis.  These methods measure pore                 
              water profiles and benthic chamber DOC fluxes in continental                   
              margin sediments from the Western North Atlantic Ocean and are                 
              providing a set of &13C (DOC) determinations on pore water                     
              samples from the same cores.  Two benthic carbon cycle studies                 
              will be carried out, one at the Bermuda time-series site (with                 
              Dr. Fred Sayles) and the other on the Peru continental margin                  
              (with Dr. Richard Jahnke).  By carrying out the DOC investigation              
              within the context of broader pore water/benthic flux studies of               
              organic mater decomposition, the role of DOC in the carbon cycle               
              and carbon isotope budgets at the sea floor will be quantified.
