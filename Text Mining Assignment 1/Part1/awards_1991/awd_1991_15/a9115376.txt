Abstract    :
              This award supports a two year program that will use a technique               
              known as Doppler imaging to study the surface structure on certain             
              types of stars.  The investigators will derive images of large star            
              spots (analagous to sunspots on our Sun) on cool binary stars.                 
              These spots trace the emergent magnetic flux and the distribution              
              and evolution of these spots over time provides fundamental                    
              information on magnetic and convective processes in these stars.               
                                                                                             
              The research program will continue to improve the Doppler imaging              
              technique and provide long term monitoring of several different                
              stars and stellar systems.
