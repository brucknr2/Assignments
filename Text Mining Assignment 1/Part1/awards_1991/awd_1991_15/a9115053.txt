Abstract    :
              One of the oldest questions in modern astronomy is: what is the                
              percentage of stars accompanied by planetary systems?  The bridge              
              between low-mass stars and giant planets, such as Jupiter, is a                
              class of objects called "brown dwarfs."  Brown dwarfs shine at                 
              infrared (IR) wavelengths from energy released by slow gravi-                  
              tational contraction.  During the next three years the Principal               
              Investigator (PI) and his Co-Investigator will continue a long-term            
              and previously NSF-supported survey to search for brown dwarfs.                
              Because brown dwarfs are not too much fainter than white dwarfs,               
              they will obtain electronic images of several hundred white dwarfs             
              with an IR camera and estimate the number of brown dwarfs among                
              them.  They will also continue to monitor previously discovered                
              brown-dwarf/white-dwarf systems to determine their orbital charac-             
              teristics and ultimately the masses of these objects.  It is                   
              expected that this and related studies will contribute                         
              significantly to our understanding of the formation of stars                   
              and planets, and in particular whether all these objects are                   
              products of the same formation process.
