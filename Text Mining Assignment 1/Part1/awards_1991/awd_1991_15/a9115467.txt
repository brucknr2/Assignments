Abstract    :
                   The research issues to be addressed include:  study of mesh               
              design methodologies; recognition of geometric features of                     
              workpiece and tooling; decomposition of two-dimensional domains                
              into regions bounded by four curves; suitability of the                        
              hierarchical refinement model of design for mesh design tasks;                 
              research of geometric data structures for finite element systems;              
              and automated smoothing of evolving boundaries.                                
                   As the outcome of this investigation, a novel technology for              
              automated two-dimensional metal forming modeling should result.                
              This technology will contribute to the transformation of non-linear            
              Lagrangian finite element analysis from a research analysis method             
              to an engineering design tool.  Furthermore, the availability of               
              automated finite element analysis could enable the integration of              
              process design and analysis systems.  Design could be readily                  
              evaluated through modeling, and modeling results fed back to the               
              design system for redesign.  Finally, the study and understanding              
              of the way in which humans perceive and understand shape has                   
              important implications in the automation of those design activities            
              that, like mechanical design, are dominated by geometric reasoning.
