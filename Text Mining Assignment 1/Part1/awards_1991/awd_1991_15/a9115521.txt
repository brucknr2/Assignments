Abstract    :
              This award, which is jointly funded with NASA, supports the                    
              systematic measurement of the natural thermoluminescence levels                
              in suitable Antarctic meteorites.  Since natural                               
              thermoluminescence is a function of radiation and thermal                      
              history, its measurement enables partial assessment of questions               
              relating to the origin of the meteorites and how to choose                     
              significant meteorites for detailed study.  Some of the                        
              meteorites to be studied  have experienced minimal exposure to                 
              cosmic rays (those that are undersaturated with 26Al) and thus                 
              are extremely interesting.  This project is designed to help                   
              clarify natural thermoluminescence production systematics and to               
              improve interpretation of the results of geochemical analyses of               
              meteorites.
