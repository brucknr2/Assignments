Abstract    :
              Dr. Craig Wheeler will use this award to explore thermal                       
              instabilities in accretion disks in a variety of contexts in order             
              to gain a deeper understanding of transient phenomena in binary                
              stars and related systems.  An attempt will be made to incorporate             
              models of non-local angular momentum transport to supplant current             
              models for viscosity.  The sensitivity of unstable disks to key                
              parameters, such as transfer rate, inner and outer disk radii,                 
              central mass, and viscosity, will be explored.  Models of the                  
              magnetically truncated disk of the intermediate polar binary system            
              GK Per will be refined to make quantitative predictions of the X-              
              ray, ultraviolet, and optical behavior of the next outburst                    
              expected about mid 1992.  Models incorporating time dependent                  
              coronae and the attendant effects of disk irradiation from the                 
              inner disk, the compact object, and the corona will be used to                 
              explore the behavior of soft X-ray transients like Agl X-1 and Cen             
              X-4 which contain neutron stars and a number of transient black                
              hole candidates.
