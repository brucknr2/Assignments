Abstract    :
              This infrastructure award is for the development of an Imaging                 
              Laboratory that supports research in both dynamic imaging and in               
              the processing of imaging data.  Specific research projects                    
              supported by this laboratory include studies of human visual                   
              perception, video compression, three dimensional motion analysis,              
              image reconstruction, adaptive filtering, and stereo vision.  The              
              award provides four years support for both equipment and                       
              maintenence.
