Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Most invertebrate phyla contain species which include a larval                 
              phase in their life cycle. In certain instances, however, there                
              has been a tendancy to modify or eliminate the larval phase.                   
              Little is known about how modifications in development arise                   
              during evolutoin. In this proposal, a model system is developed                
              and exploited to study the mechanisms underlying evolutionary                  
              changes in development. This model system consists of two closely              
              related species of ascidians that exhibit different larval forms               
              and are capable of interspecific hybridizatrion. Molgula oculata               
              (the urodele species) develops a conventional tailed (or urodele)              
              larva, which contains brain pigment cells, a notochord, and tail               
              muscle cells. In contrast, Molgula occulta (the anural species)                
              develops a tailless (or anural) larva, which lacks brain pigment               
              cells, a notochord, and differentiated muscle cells. Hybrids                   
              produced by fertilizing eggs of the anural speies with sperm of                
              the urodele species develop a brain pigment cell and notochrod                 
              but do not form differentiated muscle cells, suggesting that both              
              maternal and zygotic changes have occured during the evolution of              
              anural development. This proposal combines embryological and                   
              molecular approaches 1) to characterize the maternal and zygotic               
              changes involved in the switch from urodele to anural larval                   
              development, 2) to examine the molecular mechanisms responsible                
              for lack of muscle cell differentiation in the anural species and              
              3) to determine the phylogenetic realtionship of anural and                    
              urodele ascidians. The results are expected to provide a more                  
              comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms underying                        
              evolutionary changes in development.
