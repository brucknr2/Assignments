Abstract    :
              The proposed research is aimed at eventually developing a                      
              "Mendelian" and molecular framework for quantitative genetics using            
              height in maize as a model system.  By correlating dwarf loci                  
              exhibiting extreme effects upon plant height (particularly those               
              involved in gibberellin biosynthesis) with loci demonstrated by                
              RFLP analysis to affect variation in height quantitatively, it                 
              should be possible to verify the hypothesis that major                         
              "Quantitative Trait Loci" and "single-gene mutant loci" in many                
              cases will simply represent alternative alleles at the same locus.             
              This effort will follow up on earlier RFLP analysis which                      
              demonstrated a casual positional correlation between the two types             
              of loci.  By measuring the effect of exogenously-added gibberellin             
              (GA) upon the actions of plant quantitative loci and determining               
              the positions of maize dwarf loci with respect to RFLP marker loci,            
              a stronger linkage could be obtained that will demonstrate that                
              plant loci controlling GA levels can affect phenotypic variation,              
              both quantitatively and qualitatively.                                         
                                                                                             
              The results of this work will directly facilitate cloning efforts              
              for these genes that could then be used to study how variation in              
              individual gene action contributes to variation in complex                     
              phenotypes and how that variation is modulated by environmental                
              influences.*** //
