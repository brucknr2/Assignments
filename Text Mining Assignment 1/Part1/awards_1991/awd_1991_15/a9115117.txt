Abstract    :
                   Dr. Michael Bowers is the Research Coordinator at the                     
              University of Virginia's Blandy Experimental Farm, and he                      
              requests support for an upgrade of the Farm's meteorological                   
              station and on-site microcomputers for data processing.  Research              
              at this field station includes old field succession studies,                   
              plant physiology, plant/animal interactions, and ground water                  
              hydrology.  Improved environmental data would benefit research in              
              all of these areas.                                                            
                   The new weather station would include automatic data logging              
              equipment that would increase the accuracy and reliability of the              
              data records.  A new microcomputer would increase access to and                
              analyses of the station's weather data and other environmental                 
              databases (digital maps, annual soil surveys, ground water                     
              levels) and records (maps, aerial photographs, plant specimens in              
              the Arboretum).
