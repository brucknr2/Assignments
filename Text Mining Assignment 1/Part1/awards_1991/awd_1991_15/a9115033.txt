Abstract    :
              The topic of interacting binary star systems has become a nexus                
              of stellar astrophysics, searching as a bridge between traditional             
              studies of the evolution of single stars and the newer areas that              
              include the evolution of accretion disks around companions to                  
              expanding stars as well as of episodic "mass losers," such as                  
              B-emission and cataclysmic variable stars. In this two-year                    
              proposal, the Principal Investigator and his collaborator, Dr. P.              
              Etzel of San Diego State University, will continue a program of                
              simultaneous monitoring of interacting binaries that include an                
              evolving hot star ("Algol systems"). They will carry out                       
              observations at the 1-meter telescope of Mt. Laguna Observatory                
              outside of San Diego. They will use this facility in a dual mode,              
              monitoring light and spectral variations nearly simultaneously as              
              these stars orbit around one another every few days.  They will                
              compare these data obtained throughout the orbital period for each             
              star with models of accretion disks the PI has computed in which               
              "non-LTE" effects are included.
