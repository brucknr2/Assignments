Abstract    :
              The purpose of this award is to support the development of a                   
              strategic plan for the College of Engineering at Southern                      
              University.  Southern University is a historically black                       
              institution (HBCU) challenged with educating minority engineers.               
              Presently, Black Americans are underrepresented in the engineering             
              population and it has been projected that the future supply of                 
              engineers will be less than the anticipated demand.  Standard                  
              methodology similar to that certified by the American Association              
              of School Administrators/National Academy of School Executives will            
              be used for the development of the strategic plan.  This strategic             
              plan is necessary to guide Southern University and its College of              
              Engineering toward increasing the supply of minority engineers                 
              throughout this decade and into the next century.
