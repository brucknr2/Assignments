Abstract    :
                   This award supports the cross-disciplinary efforts and the                
              development of research collaboration involving quantitative                   
              modelling in the geosciences.  In particular the collaborators'                
              research will focus on measurement and statistical methodology                 
              for physical aspects of mountain system instabilities arising                  
              both from natural environmental factors and from changing levels               
              of human activity.
