Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research is a study of the vertical magnetic structure of                 
              ocean crust rocks collected by Ocean Drilling Program.                         
              Modified conventional magnetic survey and inversion analysis                   
              techniques will be applied to vertical sections in fracture                    
              zones.  A high resolution magnetic survey will be carried out                  
              with a submersible on the Blanco Scarp face to augment existing                
              deep-tow magnetic data from the area.  Funds are provided to                   
              develop, test and apply the magnetic analysis and inversion                    
              techniques to these data sets.
