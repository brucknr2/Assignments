Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Using cores collected in the Cariaco Basin (Venezuela) in                 
              1990, proposed analyses will focus on interannual and millennial-              
              scale variability in upwelling, regional wind strength, and the                
              hydrological balance in northern South America over the last 20-30             
              thousand years.  Of particular interest will be decadal records                
              over the Little Ice Age and the Younger Dryas Event.  Comparison of            
              varve and 14-C chronologies will provide the much-needed                       
              independent record of secular 14-C variations through the last                 
              deglaciation.
