Abstract    :
              This project will conduct spatial, thermal, and compositional                  
              analyses of fluid inclusions in plutonic samples from Ocean                    
              Drilling Project core 735B and a suite of metaplutonic and diabase             
              samples recovered from the Atlantis II fracture zone.                          
              Microthermometric results of fracture-bound fluids in these                    
              ductily-deformed and hydrothermally altered rocks will be used to              
              develop a model for fracture-fluid evolution in the high-                      
              temperature root zones of submarine hydrothermal systems associated            
              with slow spreading environments.
