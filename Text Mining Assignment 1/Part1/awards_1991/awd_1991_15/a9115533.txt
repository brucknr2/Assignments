Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program and             
              the Instrumentation and Instrument Development Program will help               
              the Department of Chemistry at California Institute of Technology              
              acquire a 400 MHz NMR spectrometer which will be used in research              
              investigations in the following areas of chemistry:

                  Oxidations                                                                 
                                                                                             
              2.  Polymerization Reactions                                                   
                                                                                             
              3.  DNA and RNA Recognition                                                    
                                                                                             
              4.  Development of High-Spin Hydrocarbons                                      
                                                                                             
              5.  Small Designer Peptides                                                    
                                                                                             
              6.  Synthesis of Natural Products                                              
                                                                                             
              Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy is the most                      
              powerful tool available to the chemist for the elucidation of the              
              structure of molecules.  It is used to identify unknown                        
              substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within                 
              molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between                   
              molecules in solution.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR                         
              spectroscopy is essential to chemists who are carrying out                     
              frontier research.  The results from these NMR studies are useful              
              in areas such as polymers and catalysis, and in biology.
