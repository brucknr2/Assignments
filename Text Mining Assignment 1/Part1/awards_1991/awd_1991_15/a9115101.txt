Abstract    :
              Dr. Harriet Dinerstein will use several observational techniques               
              to address the question of how stars undergo the transformation                
              from late stage red giants into planetary nebulae and ultimately               
              white dwarfs.  This transitory evolutionary episode is a crucial               
              turning point in stellar life histories, yet it is still not well              
              understood.  Dr. Dinerstein will investigate and define the                    
              properties of the massive residual neutral envelopes around the                
              ionized cores of planetary nebulae.  Recent work has demonstrated              
              the presence of these envelopes and illustrated the use of optical             
              and infrared spectroscopy to determine their parameters.  Data on              
              the amount and distribution of neutral material are essential to               
              any comprehensive picture of the mass loss and planetary nebula                
              formation process.  Dr. Dinerstein will also study evolved bipolar             
              nebulae, which represent the phase immediately preceding the                   
              appearance of a recognizable planetary nebula.  By combining                   
              results of observations at several wavelengths, Dr. Dinerstein will            
              be able to determine the general geometry of these structures and              
              locate the main mass and emission components.  The comparison of               
              objects at different stages of development should clarify the                  
              evolutionary progression through this transient and transforming               
              stage of stellar evolution.
