Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A study of C-isotopic composition and Cd and Ba concentration in               
              pore waters from Atlantic and Pacific box cores together with C-13             
              and Cd/Ca and Ba/Ca ratios of benthic forminiferal tests in same               
              samples.  The objective is to document the any relationship between            
              these chemical traces in pore waters and forminiferal tests that               
              can the be used as a paleoenvironmental tool in microhabitat                   
              studies of the past.
