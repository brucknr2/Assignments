Abstract    :
                   Accurate calculations for a number of heavy elements in                   
              various stages of ionization considering collisional excitation,               
              radiative transitions, photoionization and recombination will be               
              performed using the R-matrix method.  The focus will be primarily              
              on the Iron period elements in order to resolve the apparent                   
              overabundance of Ni relative to Iron in astronomical objects.                  
              Relativistic effects heretofore not considered will be                         
              incorporated into the calculations, an atomic database                         
              constructed and some astrophysical modelling performed.  Close                 
              collaboration with the Opacity project is intended.  The                       
              calculations will be performed on the Cray YMP at Ohio State at                
              no cost to the NSF.
