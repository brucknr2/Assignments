Abstract    :
                   This is a proposal to develop a curriculum and the necessary              
              support materials to introduce parallelism into the mainstream of              
              undergraduate computer science education.  The material will first be          
              organized into four modules:                                                   
                                                                                             
                          o  Parallel Computation: architecture, organization and            
                             hardware                                                        
                          o  Parallel Computation: theory, algorithms and data               
                             structures                                                      
                          o  Parallel Computation: languages and tools                       
                          o  Parallel Computation: applications                              
                                                                                             
              These modules will then be used to provide topics to be covered in six         
              new courses on parallel computing.  The University will offer                  
              workshops for educators and industrial partners.
