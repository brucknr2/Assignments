Abstract    :
              We are requesting funds for a multi-investigator chromatography                
              system which consists of a high performance liquid chromatography              
              (HPLC) instrument with photodiode array (PDA) capability.  The                 
              instrumentation will provide faculty and students with use of                  
              state-of-the-art equipment that is needed at this time for a                   
              growing research program.  Specifically, this instrument is to be              
              used by multiple investigators on the following research problems:             
              (1) biogeochemcial cycling of organic matter in the Sabine-Neches              
              estuary; (2) isolation of the neuroendocrine factors regulating                
              water balance in the earthworm; (3) chemical fate studies of                   
              organic molecules in the environment; (4) studies on molluscan                 
              immunobioloby.  The separation and purification of macromolecules              
              is of prime importance to all of these projects, and HPLC would                
              provide this capability.  The photodiode array detector will allow             
              for identification of molecules in complex mixtures, particularly              
              when working in natural systems.
