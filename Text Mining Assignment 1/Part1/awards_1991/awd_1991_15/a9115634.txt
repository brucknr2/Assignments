Abstract    :
              The objective of this research is to develop a                                 
              comprehensive constitutive theory for granular material                        
              based on concepts of statistical micromechanics, taking                        
              into account the contact properties and interaction between                    
              particles. The focus will be on probabilistic nature of the                    
              material structure, and mechanism of particle deformation.                     
              Computer simulation will be conducted to aid the                               
              development of the theory. Experimental results for sands                      
              obtained from the literature will be used to validate the                      
              theory.
