Abstract    :
                   Single-cell techniques for measuring species-specific growth              
              rates and quantum yield in situ have been developed and tested.                
              The growth rates of individual species of marine phytoplankton                 
              can be determined from data on a species' diel cycle of DNA                    
              replication.  The species-specific quantum yield is determined                 
              from single-cell absorption spectra and the spectral                           
              distribution of daily integrated light intensity.  These                       
              techniques have been tested in field conditions, and the results               
              agree with related lab studies.                                                
                   In this research, Dr. Carpenter and collaborators will                    
              develop a simpler and more widely applicable method of measuring               
              growth rates by using cell cycle markers.  This new approach will              
              be less time consuming, eliminate the requirement for                          
              sophisticated equipment, and allow the production of permanent                 
              slides for record keeping.  A technique for separating                         
              phytoplankton cells from zooplankton and detrital particles will               
              be developed to make these measurements possible.  In addition,                
              these techniques will be applied to study the causes of                        
              phytoplankton succession in Long Island Sound and to test the                  
              hypothesis that the change from a diatom dominated community to a              
              dinoflagellate dominated one is caused by the alteration of                    
              intrinsic growth rates in corresponding populations.
