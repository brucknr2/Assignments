Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The objective of this work is to study diffusion and transport in              
              polymer solutions.  The primary physical method will be light                  
              scattering spectroscopy, which is a non-invasive probe of Brownian             
              motion and diffusion in equilibrium complex fluids.  Measurements              
              of the diffusion of polymer chains through solutions containing a              
              second type of polymer chain will be made and compared with extant             
              models of polymer dynamics.  Observations will be made on the                  
              diffusion of mesoscopic (200A-micrometer) probe particles through              
              polymer solutions.  Of particular interest are the behavior of                 
              probe particles in polymer solutions at very large concentrations              
              and molecular weight, the temperature dependence of the probe                  
              diffusion coefficient, and the behavior of probe particles in                  
              polymer solutions in which the polymer has an unusually wide                   
              molecular weight distribution.  A effort will be made to involve               
              undergraduate students in real, publishable research, thereby                  
              potentially enhancing the country's scientific and engineering                 
              manpower pool.  Theoretical models relevant to these experiments               
              will be improved.
