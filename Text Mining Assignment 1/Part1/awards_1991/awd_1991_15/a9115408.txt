Abstract    :
                   The late Jurassic to early Cretaceous history of the                      
              Peninsular Ranges, California is thought to involve collision of               
              an oceanic arc with cratonic North America, collapsing a                       
              sedimentary basin between.  However, a prominent shear zone thought            
              to record this collision has been shown to involve rocks of too                
              young an age and has extensional, not contractional kinematics.                
              This project will involve detailed mapping of the Cuyamaca-                    
              Laguna Mountains shear zone, study of oriented samples and                     
              radiometric age dating.  Results should provide a test of the                  
              collisional model for the late Jurassic to early Cretaceous of the             
              Peninsular Ranges.
