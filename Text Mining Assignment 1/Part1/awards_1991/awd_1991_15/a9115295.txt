Abstract    :
                   Field and laboratory studies will be conducted to better                  
              understand the role of particulate phase organic compounds in                  
              atmospheric biogeochemical cycles.  One principal objective of                 
              the research is the completion of the chemical analysis of                     
              aerosol samples that have already been collected as part of a                  
              study on rural oxidants and to perform multi-variate statistical               
              analysis of the data.  By way of further field studies, another                
              objective is the further elucidation of the different factors                  
              that relate to the chemistry of vapor and particle phase organic               
              compounds that have already been measured at an urban location in              
              Boulder, Colorado, and a pristine site at Niwot Ridge, Colorado.               
              A final objective is the characterization of nitrogen- and                     
              sulfur- containing organic constituents of tropospheric                        
              particulate and of the relationships of such compounds to                      
              atmospheric photolytic oxidation cycles.  In these studies,                    
              hourly variations in the particulate phase organic composition                 
              will be determined using a low-volume sampling technique followed              
              by chromatographic separation and sensitive detection.  Proposed               
              studies of nitrogen- and sulfur-containting organic constituents               
              of particles will require the development of new analytical                    
              methods involving supercritical fluid extractions and selective                
              detection by chemiluminescene techniques and atomic emission.
