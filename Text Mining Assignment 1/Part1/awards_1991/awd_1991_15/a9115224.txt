Abstract    :
                   Dr. Philip Helfrich is the Director of the Hawaii Institute               
              of Marine Biology, which is a research organization within the                 
              University of Hawaii system.  The Institute operates a marine                  
              laboratory on Coconut Island in Kaneohe Bay, Oahu, approximately               
              40 miles from the main campus of the University.  The Lab is                   
              actively used by resident and visiting investigators for a variety             
              of research projects, many of which focus on the nearby coral reef             
              tracts.  Dr. Helfrich has initiated a program of laboratory                    
              renovation that will repair building decay resulting from harsh                
              conditions near shoreline.                                                     
                   The planned renovations will produce weather-tight lab space              
              suitable for scientific instruments and biochemical procedures.                
              Ongoing research projects will become more effective, and many new             
              projects will be initiated because of the availability of suitable             
              lab facilities.  The tropical reefs adjacent to the Coconut Island             
              Lab have been the subject of important research on reef ecology,               
              physiology of marine organisms, photobiology, and many other                   
              topics.  Important future research on these reefs will depend on               
              easy access to state-of-the-art lab facilities.
