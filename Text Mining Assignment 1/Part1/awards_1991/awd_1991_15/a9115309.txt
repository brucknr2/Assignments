Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The objective of this US-Poland research project between                       
              Dr. Jurg X. Saladin of the University of Pittsburgh and                        
              Drs. W. Nazarewicz, S. Cwick, and Z. Szymanski of the                          
              University of Warsaw is to study nuclei under conditions                       
              of extreme rotational velocities.  In the mass 70 to 80                        
              region, the studies will focus on properties of rotational                     
              bands which are characterized by rapid changes as a                            
              function of the number of protons and neutrons and as a                        
              function of angular frequency.  The researchers will                           
              determine quantities of the moments of inertia,                                
              electromagnetic transition rates, spin alignment,                              
              signature splitting and signature inversion.  They will                        
              interpret the results of these measurements by means of                        
              cranked shell model calculations, which include Strutinsky                     
              averaging and take into account the effects of the pairing                     
              interaction.  They will search for electric molecule                           
              transitions in the mass 80 region using an array of mini-                      
              orange electron spectrometers.  Monopole transitions                           
              depend on the mixing of bands with different shapes and on                     
              the changes in the rms radius.  The researchers will study                     
              the decay of superdeformed bands in the rare earth region                      
              into bands of normal deformation using the same                                
              measurements.  They will also study the octupole effects                       
              in the actinide region.                                                        
                                                                                             
              This project in theoretical nuclear physics fulfills the                       
              program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by                         
              enabling leading experts in the United States and Eastern                      
              Europe to combine complementary talents and pool resources                     
              in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
