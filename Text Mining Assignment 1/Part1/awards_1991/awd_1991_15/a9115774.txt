Abstract    :
                   Recent evidence shows that epidermal browning of tall-                    
              stemmed, long-lived cacti is related to total time of sun                      
              exposure.  Epidermal browning is much greater on the southern                  
              exposures of such cacti in the Northern Hemisphere and on                      
              northern exposures of similar species in the Southern Hemisphere.              
              This surface browning leads to death of individual cacti.  An                  
              evaluation of authentic photographs of saguaro cacti an Arizona                
              for the past 90 years shows that epidermal browning has                        
              increased by about 4% per decade, the same percentage increase in              
              ultraviolet (UV) radiation exposure in the United States over the              
              past three decades.  The increase in ultraviolet light exposure                
              has been shown to be related to the depletion of the ozone layer               
              in the stratosphere.  The data base (473 cacti) of saguaros has                
              been able to show the sequence of steps during epidermal                       
              browning.   The purpose of the proposed research is to make the                
              same series of phenological and physiological measurements on                  
              several species of cacti in Chile and Argentina, to determine if               
              the sequence of steps of epidermal browning is similar to those                
              of saguaros.  If the sequence of steps is similar among all these              
              cacti (both Northern and Southern hemispheres), the basis for                  
              further investigation of a possible mechanism for UV-indeed                    
              injury would be strengthened.
