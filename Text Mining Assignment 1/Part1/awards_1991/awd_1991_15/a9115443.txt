Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This program examines the role of grain boundaries in affecting                
              superplasticity.  Two aluminum-based alloys are selected for the               
              studies.  These alloys are produced by two methods, mechanical                 
              alloying and powder metallurgy.  The deformation characteristics               
              and grain boundary properties are determined and correlated with               
              the measured superplastic behavior.  Transmission electron                     
              microscopy is used to examine grain misorientations.  Scanning                 
              electron microscopy is employed to determine the extent of grain               
              boundary sliding.  An improved model of superplastic forming should            
              result.                                                                        
              %%%                                                                            
              A fundamental understanding of grain boundary properties in fine-              
              grained alloys is needed for future development of enhanced                    
              superplasticity in metal alloys.  This type of processing can                  
              result in low cost, near-net shape forming of structural metal                 
              components.
