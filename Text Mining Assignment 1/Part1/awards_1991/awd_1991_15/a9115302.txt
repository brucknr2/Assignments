Abstract    :
              This proposed dissertation study will analyze the articulation                 
              between Yupiaq and Western ways of knowing. It will focus on the               
              setting of a fish camp, which reflects traditional Yupiaq ways of              
              knowing, and examine how these Native people use their own                     
              principles of science, and how they adapt to western science and               
              technology. The project will further assess science curriculums in             
              Yupiaq schools in Alaska to determine to what extent local                     
              resources, cultural knowledge and practices can be used to develop             
              culturally relevant science education for the Yupiaq and other                 
              Native peoples.
