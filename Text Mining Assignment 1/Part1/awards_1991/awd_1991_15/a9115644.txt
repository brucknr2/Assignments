Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A charge-coupled-device (CCD) mosaic will be constructed for use               
              on the new WIYN telescope.  This array of four custom 2048x2048                
              pixel CCDs will be the primary imaging detector for the WIYN                   
              Observatory.  The construction of the detector/controller/software             
              system will be shared between the National Optical Astronomy                   
              Observatories (NOAO) and Indiana University.  The mosaic will cover            
              an area 9.6 arc minutes on a side with only 2.8 arc seconds                    
              separating the four CCDs.  A versatile filter/shutter assembly will            
              be constructed equipped with three interchangeable filter wheels.              
              The controller will have a wide range of operating modes which,                
              coupled with a broad filter complement, will accommodate a large               
              variety of scientific programs.  Special hardware and software will            
              be used to enhance the capabilities of the system for time-resolved            
              stellar photometry.
