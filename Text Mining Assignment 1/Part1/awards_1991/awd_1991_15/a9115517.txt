Abstract    :
              On every list of outstanding astrophysical problems of the late                
              twentieth century is the "solar neutrino problem," or the deficit              
              of detected neutrinos compared to those expected from interior                 
              models of the Sun. Solar neutrinos are measured using perchloro-               
              ethylne (cleaning fluid) in Homestake Mine in South Dakota. The                
              chlorine atoms in this solution are converted to an argon-37                   
              isotope by solar neutrinos and are then extracted to measure the               
              rate of neutrino emission. The deficit in detected neutrinos                   
              was first discovered at Homestake over twenty years ago. It                    
              has led since to the construction of several other neutrino                    
              detection facilities in Russia, Japan, and Italy. This award will              
              support the operations of the Homestake Experiment for an                      
              additional two years.
