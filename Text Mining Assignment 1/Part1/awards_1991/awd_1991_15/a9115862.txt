Abstract    :
              A new console for a 500 MHz GE GN500 NMR spectrometer is                       
              requested.  The spectrometer will be used for two-and three-                   
              dimensional NMR studies of macromolecular structure.  The                      
              structural studies to be carried out include investigations of                 
              the solution conformation of (1) DNA triplexes, (2) DNA                        
              quadruplexes, (3) other unusual DNA structures, including                      
              oligonucleotides containing B-Z junctions, (4) drug-DNA                        
              complexes, (5) protein-DNA complexes, (6) designed peptides-                   
              protein complexes.  The new console is essential for these                     
              studies in order to be able to implement new three-dimensional                 
              NMR experiments and experiments which require shaped pulses and                
              to obtain higher quality two-dimensional NMR spectra.  The new                 
              console will replace a 6 year old Nicolet 1280-based GN500                     
              console with a console that contains a computer that can handle                
              more sophisticated pulse sequences and modern electronics.
