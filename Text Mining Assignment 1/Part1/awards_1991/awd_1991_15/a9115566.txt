Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This three-year award supports cooperative research in plant                   
              physiology between Raymond Chollet of the University of                        
              Nebraska and Jean Vidal of the Laboratory for Plant Molecular                  
              Physiology, University of Paris (South).  The investigators will               
              examine the photoregulatory mechanism that controls the functional             
              properties and biosynthesis of C4-leaf PEPC. PEPC is                           
              a key enzyme in photosynthesis.  Using mutagenesis techniques on               
              maize and sorghum specimens, they will substitute specific amino               
              acids on the phosphorylation sites and assess their effects on the             
              enzyme's regulatory and catalytic properties.                                  
                                                                                             
              The French will add a molecular genetic dimension to the project.              
              They are experienced in mapping and cloning of PEPC while the                  
              U.S. investigators have the instrumentation and extensive                      
              biochemical expertise for large-scale PEPC isolation and protein               
              sequencing.  The project will benefit from this interactive,                   
              molecular-genetic and biochemical approach.  PEPC studies will                 
              extend our knowledge of light regulation C4 photosynthesis and                 
              enhance our understanding of protein phosphorylation.
