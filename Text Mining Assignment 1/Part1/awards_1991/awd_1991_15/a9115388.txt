Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              This proposal requests support for workshop on parallel computer               
              performance, emphasizing software tools.  The workshop, the third in           
              the series, will be held in Santa Fe, New Mexico, in early October,            
              1991.  The workshop organizers recognize a pressing need for a                 
              continuing and productive exchange of ideas between scientists                 
              engaged in research on performance measurement of high performance,            
              parallel computing systems.  Research areas especially concerned with          
              performance related empirical and analytical knowledge the design of           
              hardware and software for parallel systems and research explore the            
              usefulness of such systems for scientific computing.  The workshop,            
              sponsored by Los Alamos and the University of Illinois at Urbana-              
              Champaign is designed to bring together experts from academia,                 
              industry, national laboratories and government agencies to explore             
              these issues.  The goals of the workshop are to ascertain the current          
              availability of tools for parallel computer performance evaluation,            
              to report experiences with existing tools, and to determine future             
              needs in the areas of performance measurement, analysis, and                   
              visualization.                                                                 
                                                                                             
              Thel expertise of the planned attendees, success of the past                   
              workshops, and the intrinsic merit and relevance of the topic area             
              ensures that this workshop will result in valuable interaction and             
              products.
