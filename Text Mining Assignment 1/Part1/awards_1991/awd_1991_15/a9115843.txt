Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Study of trace element abundance and isotopic ratios in a suite of             
              gabbros and basalts from Cayman Rise spreading center which have               
              been the subject of several previous geochemical and petrological              
              studies.  The objectives of this study are to determine the                    
              processes of formation of gabbros and the extent of heterogeneities            
              at deep levels in the mid Cayman Rise crust.
