Abstract    :
              This proposal is aimed at the preparation of new classes of porous             
              materials based on the pillaring of layered compounds.  High                   
              temperature solid-state reaction chemistry, or the use of organic              
              molecules containing hydrophillic functional groups to exfoliate               
              the layers, are two techniques to be developed to control the                  
              lateral spacing of the pillars.  Electron and x-ray diffraction,               
              electron microscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance, and surface area              
              and pore size measurements will be used to characterize these                  
              compounds for possible use as catalysts, sensors, ion exchangers               
              and non-linear optical materials.
