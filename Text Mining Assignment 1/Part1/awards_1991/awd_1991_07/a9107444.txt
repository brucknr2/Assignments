Abstract    :
              This award is made in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and                          
              Organometallic Chemistry Program in support of the research of                 
              Dr. Kenton Whitmire at Rice University. The research deals with                
              the synthesis, structure, and reactivity of main                               
              group/transition metal clusters.  Work will focus on the heavy                 
              main group elements (thallium, indium, lead, tin, bismuth and                  
              antimony) clustered with Group VIII transition metals (iron,                   
              cobalt, ruthenium and osmium). The goals of the research are to                
              synthesize new metal cluster compounds which will probe the                    
              limitations of current bonding theories, to study the                          
              reactivity of these complexes with a view to establishing                      
              stability and structure/function relationships, and to                         
              determine how structure, bonding and reactivity patterns vary                  
              as a function of transition metal and main group element.

              The fundamental interactions of main group elements and                        
              transition metals is a topic of considerable importance to                     
              chemistry, materials science and catalysis.  Main                              
              group/transition metal alloys have interesting electronic and                  
              magnetic properties while main group element compounds are                     
              often used as promoters in commercial catalytic processes.
