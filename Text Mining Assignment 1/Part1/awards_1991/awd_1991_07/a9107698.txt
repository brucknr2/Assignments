Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Phenomena associated with valence fluctuations, heavy                     
              fermions, superconductivity and magnetism in narrow-band materials             
              will be investigated as part of a joint research program between               
              U.C.S.D. and the University of Michigan.  We shall concern                     
              ourselves with sample preparation and character-ization; and bulk              
              transport, thermal and magnetic measurements.
