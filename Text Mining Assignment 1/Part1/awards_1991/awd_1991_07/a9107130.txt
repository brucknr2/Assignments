Abstract    :
              This work will study the evolution of communication in                         
              populations of agents, situated in simple, artificial                          
              environments.  The primary research methodology is experimental                
              and task-oriented in nature, involving the simulation of                       
              populations of male/female ANNs, using genetic operators (i.e.                 
              recombination, mutation and selection) that are applied to                     
              initially random populations of genotypes (which specify ANN                   
              connection weights and biases).  Current simulations are being                 
              done both on computer workstations and a 16K Connection Machine                
              (CM-2), whose massive SIMD parallelism is particularly suited to               
              such simulations.  These initial simulation studies will be                    
              headed in several direction -- ones that will support the                      
              evolution of more complex forms of communication.  These                       
              directions include: (a) evolving more complex ANN architectures,               
              (b) introducing multiple, distinct species in the environment,                 
              (c) adding simple forms of learning, metabolism and morphology,                
              (d) augmenting our instrumentation for analysis and                            
              interpretation of the "meaning" of the dialects that evolve, and               
              (e) increasing the complexity of the terrain and physics of the                
              environment.
