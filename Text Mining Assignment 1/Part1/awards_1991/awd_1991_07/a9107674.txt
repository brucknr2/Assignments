Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The proposed research is to develop an advanced computational                  
              fluid dynamics (CFD) software package for high-performance-                    
              distributed memory parallel processors.  The suite of codes will               
              be based on the spectral element method for the incompressible                 
              Navier-Stokes equations, and the target class of problems will be              
              flow in general two- and three-dimensional domains at                          
              transitional Reynolds numbers.  The choice of distributed memory               
              parallel architectures is motivated by their high performance and              
              economy which derive from their intrinsic ability to exploit data              
              locality.  The work will be an extension of the principal                      
              investigator's past work in parallel spectral element methods,                 
              with emphasis on increasing the geometric flexibility and                      
              functionality of existing software, through incorporation of                   
              nonconforming discretizations and addition of run-time                         
              visualization capabilities.
