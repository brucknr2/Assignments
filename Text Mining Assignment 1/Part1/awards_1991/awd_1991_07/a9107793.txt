Abstract    :
              Arabidopsis thaliana is a plant that is emerging as a model for                
              understanding plant genetics, development and physiology at the                
              molecular level.  It has many characteristics that make it more                
              amenable to molecular inquiry than are other flowering plants and              
              yet because it is a flowering plant, has many homologous DNA                   
              sequences and genes which can be used to both isolate and                      
              understand gene action in plants with less accessible genomes.  The            
              laboratory headed by Dr. Gerald Fink has been in the forefront of              
              those using Arabidopsis to ask questions which have been                       
              unanswerable in previous work with plants.  The biosynthetic                   
              pathway for aromatic amino acids is under study and that study has             
              already provided information suggesting that differences exist                 
              between the pathway in animals and plants.  Continuation of this               
              work requires more appropriate facilities for growing plants under             
              controlled conditions.                                                         
                                                                                             
              The greenhouse, which will be built on the roof of the Whitehead               
              Biomedical Institute, will allow the continuation and expansion of             
              research using plants as experimental organisms by scientists in               
              Dr. Fink's laboratory as well as others at the Institute.***//
