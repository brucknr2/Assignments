Abstract    :
                   This award supports a U.S.-U.S.S.R. Cooperation project                   
              between S. Shlomo at Texas A&M and G. Vagradov and S. Akulinichev              
              at the Institute for Nuclear Research in Moscow.  The                          
              collaboration focuses on theoretical studies of quarks in nuclei               
              as probed by deep inelastic lepton-nucleus scattering.
