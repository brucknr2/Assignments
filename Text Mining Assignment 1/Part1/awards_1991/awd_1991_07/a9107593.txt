Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program                 
              will help the Department of Chemistry at Colorado State                        
              University acquire an upgrade of their computing facilities and                
              the x-ray diffraction laboratory.  Among the areas of chemical                 
              research that will be enhanced by the acquisition are the                      
              following: 1) New Models for the Active Site of Cytochrome c                   
              Oxidase, 2) Total Synthesis of Natural Products and Development                
              of Synthetic Methodology, 3) Asymmetric Bond-Forming Reactions,                
              4) The Synthesis and Study of Biomedically Important                           
              Compounds,and 5) The Synthesis and Characterization of Reactive                
              Metal Complexes.                                                               
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
              Single crystal x-ray crystallography is the most powerful                      
              analytical method for structure determination of solids.  In                   
              synthetic inorganic, organic, bioinorganic and organometallic                  
              chemistry, single crystal x-ray diffraction is an invaluable                   
              tool to characterize molecular structure.  The information                     
              gained from the knowledge of the molecular composition and                     
              structure helps to develop new reactions of potentially general                
              interest in catalysis or synthesis.
