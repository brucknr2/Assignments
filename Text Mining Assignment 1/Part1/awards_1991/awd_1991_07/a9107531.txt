Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator, together with his collaborator                
              Marc Yor, will continue his present lines of research into                     
              stochastic processes, particularly Brownian motion and related                 
              processes.  Attention will be focussed on problems amenable to                 
              treatment using the tools of martingale calculus, local time and               
              excursion theory.  Particular subjects for study are the                       
              following:  interval partitions associated with a subordinator,                
              multiple points of Brownian motion in dimensions 2 and 3,                      
              Tsirelson's equations in discrete time, non-canonical                          
              decompositions of Brownian motion, the Ciesielski-Taylor                       
              identities in law, multivariate Cauchy variables and affine                    
              decompositions of a stable variable of index (1/2), intertwinings              
              of Markov processes, and characterization of the Brownian                      
              filtration.                                                                    
                   The principal investigator, together with his collaborator                
              Marc Yor, will continue his present lines of research into                     
              stochastic processes, particularly Brownian motion and related                 
              processes.  Attention will be focussed on problems amenable to                 
              treatment using the tools of martingale calculus, local time and               
              excursion theory.  Stochastic processes represent an important                 
              area of research in probability theory.
