Abstract    :
              This renewal award, made to the University of Utah in support                  
              of the research of Professor John Gladysz, deals with the                      
              structure, bonding, dynamic behavior and reactivity of                         
              transition metal/main group element complexes.  Specifically,                  
              complexes of a chiral rhenium nitrosyl fragment with alkyl                     
              halides, amides, sulfides and sulfoxides will be prepared,                     
              characterized and their chemistry investigated. The chiral                     
              metal center will facilitate mechanistic studies and the                       
              development of applications in asymmetric organic synthesis.                   
              Alkyl halide complexes will be tested as asymmetric alkylation                 
              reagents, amide base complexes will be screened for asymmetric                 
              deprotonation  and sulfide complexes will be screened for                      
              asymmetric oxidation to sulfoxides.

              A comprehensive study of transition metal/main group element                   
              complexes will provide insights into their structure and                       
              reactivity patterns and possibly lead to a variety of                          
              applications such as precursors to solid-state materials and as                
              catalysts or reagents for asymmetric organic synthesis.
