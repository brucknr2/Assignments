Abstract    :
              The research planned is related to the fast and accurate                       
              computation of non-homogeneous/nonlinear Cauchy-Riemann equations              
              in the complex plane; the modular code development on serial and               
              parallel computers, and its applications to solving nonlinear                  
              problems, in particular problems in compressible fluid flows.                  
              The theory of non-homogeneous Cauchy-Riemann equations developed               
              here provides a unified framework for extending the complex                    
              variable theory to solving large classes of problems involving                 
              non-analytic functions.  The effect of non-homogeneous terms is                
              shown to alter the analytic solution by an additive non-analytic               
              term which is a double integral.  The fast and accurate method of              
              evaluating this integral provides a firm ground to successful                  
              application of the theory to computing the solution at a superior              
              computational complexity.  The robust code to be developed on                  
              these ideas will be used to solve large classes of applied                     
              problems including (i) rising bubbles in a compressible fluid;                 
              and (ii) cavitating compressible flows past curved obstacles.                  
                                                                                             
              Computational Fluid Dynamics is an area of research with                       
              implication for a wide variety of scientific and engineering                   
              applications in atmospheric, physical and engineering sciences.
