Abstract    :
                   An integral component of the multi-agency U.S. Global Change              
              Research Program (Our Changing Planet," Committee on Earth                     
              Sciences, 1991) is understanding and modeling the geospace                     
              environment.  As part of its contribution to the U.S. Global                   
              Change  Research Program, the National Science Foundation's                    
              Division of Atmospheric Sciences has established a new research                
              initiative,  Geospace Environment Modeling (GEM), with the goal                
              of supporting basic research into the dynamical and structural                 
              properties of geospace, leading to the construction of a global                
              geospace model with predictive capability.                                     
                   The subjects of the first GEM campaign are the                            
              magnetospheric boundary, the magnetosheath beyond it, and the                  
              connection from the boundary through the magnetosphere to the                  
              ionosphere.  This grant is to use low-altitude spacecraft data to              
              test and refine the open-magnetosphere model of Toffoletto and                 
              Hill ?1989! with respect to the mapping of the cusp to low                     
              altitude.  The model provides quantitative predictions of the                  
              local time extent and locations of the equatorward boundary of                 
              the cusp as a function of the cross-polar-cap potential.
