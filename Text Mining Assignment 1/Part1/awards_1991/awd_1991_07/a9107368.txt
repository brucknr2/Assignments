Abstract    :
                   The topology of simply-connected algebraic surfaces and                   
              other smooth 4-manifolds will be studied.  Questions such as the               
              following will be addressed:  How do algebraic surfaces behave                 
              under connected sum?  Which 4-manifolds are sums of algebraic                  
              surfaces?  How can Donaldson's invariants be defined                           
              topologically?                                                                 
                   These are all questions at the forefront of research in                   
              four-dimensional manifold theory.  A manifold is a very natural                
              geometric object, being locally like Euclidean space, although                 
              globally more highly connected.  Since the space of general                    
              reativity theory is a four-dimensional manifold, questions such                
              as these may even have cosmological significance.
