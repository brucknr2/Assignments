Abstract    :
                   In this project the principal investigator will continue his              
              work on various problems in nonlinear continuum mechanics.  In                 
              particular, he will look at the dynamics of elastic rods in three              
              dimensions, the formation and evolution of "necks" in                          
              viscoelastic fibers, the equilibrium thermodynamics of periodic                
              phases, and the minimum energy states of nematic liquid crystals.              
              This work has enormous theoretical and technological                           
              implications.                                                                  
                   More and more one finds that technological advances are                   
              driven by improvements in the theory of nonlinear materials and                
              the successful applications of that theory.  In this project the               
              principal investigator will continue his important studies of the              
              mathematics and the physics that underlie various types of                     
              elastic, viscoelastic and crystalline materials.  This work has                
              applications to state-of-the-art problems in the production of                 
              high-strength polymers and liquid crystals of different shapes.
