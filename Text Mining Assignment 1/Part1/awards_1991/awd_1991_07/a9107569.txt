Abstract    :
                   Worldwide, many lakes undergo large changes in fish                       
              populations and nutrient loading.  The impact of each of these                 
              common changes is well-known for pelagic communities, but poorly               
              known for benthic communities.  Furthermore, nothing is known                  
              about the interaction of fish and nutrients in structuring                     
              benthic communities, or about the impact of this interaction on                
              benthic-pelagic coupling.  This project will test the responses                
              of benthic algae, macrophytes, and invertebrates to the three                  
              levels of fish predation and two levels of nutrients created by                
              the Madison team.  Benthic response variables will include                     
              abundance, species composition, size structure, biomass, and                   
              production of algae, macrophytes, and invertebrates.                           
                   A central focus is the degree to which benthic responses to               
              fish and nutrients will compensate for pelagic responses.  A                   
              central hypothesis is that progressive fertilization will prompt               
              a rapid, threshold shift from benthic to pelagic primary                       
              production.  Without the simultaneous measurements of pelagic and              
              benthic responses, our understanding of the response of lake                   
              dynamics to management efforts would suffer.  Lakes serve as                   
              major landscape features on most continents, so the results of                 
              the research should be important for a broad array of habitats.
