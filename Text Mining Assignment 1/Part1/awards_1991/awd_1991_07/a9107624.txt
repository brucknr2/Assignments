Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The primary objective of this US-Hungary research project                      
              under between Dr. Attila Vertes, Eotvos University, and                        
              Dr. Amar Nath, Drexel University, is to acquire basic                          
              understanding of the high-temperature superconductor, Y-                       
              Ba-CU-O.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              The bulk properties of this material are determined by                         
              what is happening on the microscopic level.  The                               
              technique, Mossbauer spectroscopy, is ideally suited for                       
              probing the micro-environment of copper-oxygen chains and                      
              sheets.  Both of these copper sites are believed to play                       
              an important role in the superconductivity phenomenon.                         
              The Drexel lab specializes in emission Mossbauer                               
              technique, where a minute fraction of the copper in the                        
              superconductor is substituted by cobalt-57. Investigations                     
              using absorption Mossbauer spectroscopy using iron-57,                         
              tin-119 and europium-151 will be done at Eotvos.                               
                                                                                             
              This project in high-temperature superconductivity                             
              fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific                         
              knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United States                     
              and Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and                        
              pool resources in areas of strong mutual interest and                          
              competence.
