Abstract    :
                   The unifying principal of this research is the linkage                    
              between ecosystem-level processes and the community ecology of                 
              streams.  Geothermal activity associated with volcanism is                     
              significant in determining regional landscape patterns in surface              
              water chemistry and biota along the volcanic spine of Central                  
              America.  Geothermal processes introduce natural chemical                      
              discontinuities into streams e.g. high levels of soluble reactive              
              phosphorus (SRP) that interrupt the stream continuum and                       
              influence basic ecological processes.                                          
                   The main objective of this work is to test how geothermally-              
              introduced chemical discontinuities structure lowland tropical                 
              stream communities.  The investigators (1) determine if                        
              geothermal nputs affect algal primary production and community                 
              composition in different light environments (in light gaps and                 
              shaded sections of an interior forest stream and in an open                    
              pasture stream); (2) evaluate community- and ecosystem-level                   
              response to simulated geothermal inputs of SRP using flow-                     
              through bioassays and whole-system manipulations, respectively;                
              and (3) determine how fish influence net primary production and                
              algal community structure above and below sites of geothermal                  
              discontinuities and examine interacting effects of fish and                    
              phosphorus amendments on primary production.    //
