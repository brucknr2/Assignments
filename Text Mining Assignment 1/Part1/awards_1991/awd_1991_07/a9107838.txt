Abstract    :
                   The fish family Cichlidae, is a model system for the study of             
              many biological phenomena.  Systematists, geneticists, ethologists,            
              comparative and functional morphologists have studied this family              
              probably more than any other teleostean group.  The extraordinary              
              adaptive radiation of cichlids in the East African Rift Lakes make             
              them an important subject for the study of morphology, speciation,             
              and sexual selection.  Members of this family of fishes also live              
              in Africa, Central and South America, Madagascar and India.  The               
              general aim of this study is to determine the systematic                       
              relationships among the major lineages of cichlid fishes.                      
                   Current phylogenetic hypotheses about this family and its                 
              sistergroup relationships are exclusively based on morphological               
              characters, but evidence of morphological convergence suggests that            
              it will be important to have independent evidence of phylogeny.                
                   Recent advances in DNA technology have made it possible to                
              address phylogenetic questions of the scope proposed here with                 
              molecular characters.  Mitochondrial genes will be sequenced and               
              the phylogenetic information used to construct phylogenetic                    
              relationships among the major lineages of cichlids.
