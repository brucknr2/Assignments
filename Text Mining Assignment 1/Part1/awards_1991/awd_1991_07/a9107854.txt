Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project explores the behavior of interfaces between overlayers            
              and certain semiconductor surfaces; emphasis will be on the (100)              
              orientation of gallium arsenide, and gallium antimonide. A                     
              microscopic understanding of morphology, atomic structure,                     
              chemistry(bonding), and electronic states at the interface is                  
              sought.   The model systems to be studied are chosen on the basis              
              of the formation of abrupt, ordered layers.  Materials will be                 
              prepared by molecular beam epitaxy, and analyzed by sophisticated              
              electron and photon surface analysis techniques. This work, by                 
              providing information on fundamental materials properties and                  
              behavior of interfaces is expected to increase basic scientific                
              knowledge of electronic and photonic materials, and to contribute              
              to the advancement of compound semiconductor materials for                     
              technological applications such as computing and                               
              telecommunications.
