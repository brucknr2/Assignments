Abstract    :
              Resource dilemmas are created when group members shared limited                
              resources to which all have free access(e.g., groundwater, energy,             
              minerals, endangered species.)  When group members request their               
              share from the resource pool independently, with no communication              
              among them, there is experimental evidence showing that as the                 
              uncertainty about the size of the resource increases, people                   
              increase their requests thereby lowering the probability that their            
              request will be granted.  Six experiments are proposed to study the            
              effects of several variables (e.g., amount of uncertainty about the            
              resource, group size, real-time updating of information about total            
              group request) about the resolution of resource dilemmas under two             
              protocols of play.  Under one protocol, requests are made                      
              simultaneously, and under the other, sequentially with full                    
              information about previous requests.  The proposed experiments are             
              driven by a game theoretical model prescribing an equilibrium                  
              solution and by a decision theoretical model.  The findings should             
              be useful in understanding the effects of alternative mechanisms               
              on decision behavior in resource dilemmas, which are among the most            
              serious problems facing modern society.
