Abstract    :
                   Professors Larson and Smith will conduct research in several              
              areas of operator algebras.  Professor Larson will work on                     
              problems related to similarity theory for nests,                               
              quasitriangularity considerations within von Neumann algebras,                 
              reflexivity properties of operator algebras, and to mappings                   
              between algebras of operators.  Professor Smith will focus on the              
              theory of tensor products of operator algebras, complete                       
              boundedness for C*-algebras, cohomology theory, and the structure              
              of derivations and automorphisms of non-selfadjoint algebras.                  
              Aspects of each of the investigator's work will contribute to a                
              joint study of nuclearity in triangular operator algebras.                     
                   This research project concerns families of Hilbert space                  
              operators called algebras.  A Hilbert space operator can be                    
              thought of as an infinite matrix of complex numbers.  Such                     
              objects are important in almost every branch of pure and applied               
              mathematics.  Putting together aggregates of these operators with              
              common qualities to form an algebra is a major theme in                        
              mathematics.
