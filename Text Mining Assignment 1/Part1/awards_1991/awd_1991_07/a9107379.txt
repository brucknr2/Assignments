Abstract    :
                   Emergent, floating, and submersed aquatic plants show a                   
              characteristic but unexplained zonation by depth in lakes                      
              throughout the world.  The PI proposes to test a new hypothesis                
              to account for this pattern in terms of competition, as                        
              influenced by differences between growth forms in leaf height,                 
              allocation to relatively unproductive support tissue, and                      
              ability to maintain a positive whole-plant carbon balance at                   
              different depths.  This hypothesis accounts for several trends                 
              (including some recently documented) in zonation as a function                 
              of environmental conditions and plant characteristics.  Field                  
              manipulations are proposed to determine:                                       
                   Whether emergents competitively exclude floating species                  
              from shallow water (based on removal experiments);                             
                   Whether emergent and floating species are near net annual                 
              growth at their maximum depths (based on measurements on cutting               
              transplanted to a variety of depths);                                          
                   Whether the observed pattern of decline in net growth  with               
              depth is attributed to increased allocation to support tissue                  
              (based on studies of leaf demography, the allometry of support                 
              tissue, and tissue construction costs as a function of                         
              depth);                                                                        
                   Whether dense beds of submersed plants limit the maximum                  
              depth of water in mesotrophic and eutrophic lakes (based on                    
              removal experiments); and                                                      
                   Whether large-leaved waterlilies (e.g., Nymphaea)                         
              competitively exclude smaller-leaved floating species (e.g.,                   
              Brasenia, Potamogeton) from shallow water via aggressive                       
              competition ( mechanical abrasion) or leaf overriding (based on                
              removal experiments and analysis of leaf overlap and leaf                      
              demography where the two groups co-occur).  These experiments                  
              would be conducted in a representative subset (Helen Lake, Wind                
              Pudding Lake, Wildcat Lake, Beautiful Lake) of a 10-lake                       
              fertility gradient that is currently the subject of comparative                
              studies.
