Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project supports two anthropologists studying how                         
              pastoralists in Botswana think about and manage their "life                    
              course", meaning their family size, demographic composition, and               
              wealth.  The focus is on men's reproductive decisions in a                     
              society where cattle is the main form of wealth and the kinship                
              system reckons descent primarily in the female line.  Using a                  
              combination of methods including in-depth interviews,                          
              participant-observation, time-allocation studies and small-scale               
              surveys, the researchers will learn how people manage their                    
              income, wealth, and family ties in order to attain their desired               
              level of security and well being.  Specific hypotheses to be                   
              tested are drawn from evolutionary theory.                                     
                                                                                             
              This research is important because we must understand men's                    
              reproductive goals and strategies in order to manage the growth                
              of population.  Studies like this one provide case material for                
              theory development to allow scholars to predict the impact of                  
              policies designed to limit population growth.
