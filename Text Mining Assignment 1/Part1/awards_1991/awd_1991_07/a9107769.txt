Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The University of Rochester will build a third generation near                 
              infrared camera.  The new 256x256 InSb camera will be sensitive                
              from 1 - 5 micron, and will be capable of spatial resolutions of               
              0.1 arcsec/pixel on large telescopes.  Filters will include                    
              standard broadband filters, and a circular variable filter wheel,              
              providing approximately 1% spectral resolution.  The photometer                
              will be built on an optical bench, which will later accommodate a              
              Fabry-Perot interferometer.  A flexible, computer programmable                 
              array controller for this array and other arrays that will become              
              available in the future has been designed and tested.  As well, the            
              dewar that houses the array can easily accommodate different format            
              and/or material detector arrays.  Infrared arrays are available for            
              NASA sponsored experiments.  This camera will efficiently obtain               
              large scale images at large telescopes with excellent sensitivity,             
              spatial resolution and spectral resolution.  As with previous                  
              generation cameras, other astronomers will collaborate with                    
              Rochester group and they are willing to provide others with                    
              technical information on the camera components.  Astronomical                  
              observations of star formation regions, regions associated with                
              late stellar evolution, active and starburst galazies,                         
              gravitational lens galaxies, brown dwarfs and the galatic center               
              are planned.
