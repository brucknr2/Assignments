Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Methane oxidation affects carbon and energy cycling in wetlands                
              by consuming the major reduced end product of anaerobic                        
              metabolism.  In so doing, methane oxidation couples oxic and                   
              anoxic processes within the ecosystem.  To the extent that this                
              coupling is inefficient or "leaky", methane can escape into the                
              atmosphere.  The magnitude of this flux serves to link specific                
              ecosystems, e.g., wetlands, with global-scale processes since                  
              methane plays a key role in atmospheric chemistry and the                      
              planetary heat budget.  However, in spite of the importance of                 
              methane oxidation and the significance of wetlands as methane                  
              sources, relatively little is known about spatial and temporal                 
              variability or controls of the process.  Initial studies in                    
              several diverse wetlands have identified light regimes, benthic                
              photosynthesis, water table dynamics and plant-bacterial                       
              associations as some of the most important factors controlling                 
              the rates and extent of methane oxidation.  A more complete                    
              analysis of these and other parameters will provide information                
              necessary for predicting the importance and magnitude of methane               
              fluxes from various wetlands as well as provide the necessary                  
              insights for predicting the response of methane oxidation and                  
              emission to changing climatic regimes.
