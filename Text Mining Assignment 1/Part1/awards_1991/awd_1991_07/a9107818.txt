Abstract    :
              This proposal addresses one of the most pressing questions in                  
              molecular biology today - how to predict the folding of                        
              globular proteins from their amino acid sequence. In                           
              collaboration with Y.H. Wang of Jilin University in China,                     
              Dr. Crippen will verify, analyze and extend preliminary                        
              observations that native protein conformations can be                          
              described very compactly in terms of Fourier and other such                    
              transforms, and that these transforms correlate strongly with                  
              the protein's amino acid sequence.  The subsequent goal is to                  
              develop an algorithm for searching for low energy conformations                
              of a protein using Fourier coefficients as the primary                         
              variables.  Whether the search method amounts to molecular                     
              dynamics, some kind of local or global energy minimization,                    
              or Monte Carlo procedure, the method would first manipulate                    
              the large scale features of conformation and then later                        
              adjust the small scale details.  The relation between this                     
              procedure and theories of protein folding mechanisms would be                  
              explored.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              This project brings together two scientists, one from China,                   
              and one from the US, who share a common interest and a novel                   
              approach to an important problem in molecular biology.
