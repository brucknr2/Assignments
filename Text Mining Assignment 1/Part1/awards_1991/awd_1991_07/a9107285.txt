Abstract    :
                   Professor Zimmer will study a variety of questions within the             
              general program of understanding the actions of semisimple Lie                 
              groups and their discrete subgroups on manifolds.  This includes an            
              investigation of the topological, geometric, and analytic                      
              properties of manifolds admitting such an action, and the measure              
              theoretic, topological, and geometric structure of the actions                 
              themselves.  The techniques of ergodic theory and algebraic groups,            
              combined with the geometric structure inherent in the situation,               
              will be essential throughout the work.  This award will also                   
              support three junior investigators who will conduct research in the            
              same general area.                                                             
                   Groups usually arise as transformations which preserve the                
              symmetry of some system much as the group of rotations preserves               
              the symmetry of a sphere.  Given an abstract group there are often             
              many ways it can be realized or represented as a group of                      
              transformations.  There has been much research done on the                     
              representation of groups as linear transformations on a vector                 
              space.  It is in the still unchartered realm of nonlinear actions              
              of groups on curved surfaces or manifolds where Professor Zimmer's             
              research will take place.
