Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The research to be carried out by Csaba G. Horvath, Yale                       
              University and Robert Ohmacht, School of Medicine, Pecz,                       
              Hungary under the US-Hungary Joint Fund is planned in the                      
              field of characterization and evaluation of liquid                             
              chromatographic packings.  Yale University has unique                          
              column packing facilities and substantial knowledge of                         
              biotechnology, biochemical separation.  The Institute of                       
              Chemistry is well equipped for preparative chemical work                       
              but needs urgent support in obtaining chemicals, parts and                     
              some supplements to their equipment.                                           
                                                                                             
              This project in chromatography fulfills the program                            
              objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling                        
              leading experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to                     
              combine complementary talents and pool research resources                      
              in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
