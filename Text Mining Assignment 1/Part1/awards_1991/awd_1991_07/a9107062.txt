Abstract    :
                   In drawing statistical inferences when there are several                  
              variables present, often only some of these are of direct                      
              interest.  However these are not always independent of the                     
              remainder.  Therefore, inferences are usually drawn conditional                
              upon the estimated values for the parameters which govern this                 
              remainder.  Depending upon the nature of the dependencies and the              
              particular estimates used, the primary statistical inferences may              
              or may not be very stable.  This research considers methods for                
              constructing approximate ancillary statistics or close-to-ideal                
              estimates for conditional inference in the presence of a                       
              multidimensional nuisance parameter.
