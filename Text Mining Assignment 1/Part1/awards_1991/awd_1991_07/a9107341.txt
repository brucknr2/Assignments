Abstract    :
                   The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that                  
              plant species diversity in young agricultural old-fields is                    
              maximal at moderately low levels of available soil nitrogen, a                 
              growth-limiting resource, under conditions of moderate and                     
              fine-grained disturbance to the plants in the field.  This                     
              hypothesis will be tested by creating a nitrogen availability                  
              gradient in the old-field by enhancing availability with nitrogen              
              fertilizer and by reducing availability by adding sugar to                     
              microbially immobilize nitrogen.  This approach represents the                 
              first experimental reduction of nitrogen availability to look for              
              a peak plant species diversity response.                                       
                   Many studies have shown that nitrogen fertilization of                    
              natural ecosystems leads to reductions in biological diversity.                
              The research should be of interest because it tries to examine                 
              the lower levels of nitrogen availability which may allow for                  
              maximal biological diversity.  These results should be of                      
              interest to land managers trying to conserve existing biological               
              diversity and restorationists trying to create new species-                    
              diverse ecosystems.
