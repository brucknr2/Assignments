Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Description:  Under this project, support will be provided                     
              for a scientist from Sri Lanka, Dr. Srianthie A.                               
              Deraniyagala, of the Department of Chemistry, University of                    
              Colombo, Sri Lanka, to work in the laboratory of Dr. Rex                       
              Pratt of Wesleyan University in Middletown, CT.  The                           
              research, to be carried out jointly, will seek to study the                    
              interaction of bacterial enzymes with antibiotics that may                     
              decrease the latters' effectiveness.  Specifically, a                          
              combination of secondary and solvent kinetic deuterium                         
              isotope effects will be employed to determine the structure                    
              of Beta-lactamase transition states and the extent of their                    
              stabilization through proton motion.  Extension of the                         
              experiments to the bacterial DD-peptidase enzymes, the                         
              targets of Beta-lactam antibiotics, are also planned, to                       
              further delineate the differences between the                                  
              Beta-lactamase and DD-peptidase active sites.  A close                         
              comparison of the results with previously obtained results                     
              of the serine proteinases will be made, to clarify the                         
              mechanisms of catalysis employed by these enzymes.                             
                                                                                             
              Scope:  The project brings a young, bright researcher from                     
              Sri Lanka to participate in research with, and learn new                       
              experimental techniques, from a well established and                           
              experienced U.S. researcher who has extensive knowledge in                     
              the field.  This is likely to benefit both scientists, and                     
              to encourage the expansion of similar work in Sri Lanka in                     
              the future.
