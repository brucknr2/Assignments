Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              New nonlinear spectroscopic techniques (interferometric and multi-             
              color degenerate four wave mixing), together with femto and pico               
              second conventional nonlinear and electro-optic modulation                     
              measurements, with be used to define mechanisms of optical                     
              nonlinearity in newly synthesized metal free and metallated ladder             
              copolymers, metallated macrocyclic polymers, thienylpolyene                    
              copolymers, mixed valence molecules (in solution) and polymers, the            
              photosynthetic reaction center and related model compounds, and in             
              fullerenes.  Copolymer synthesis techniques are used to overcome               
              intrinsically poor solubility of ladder, macrocyclic, and                      
              thienylpolyene materials, to retard photochemical degradation of               
              mixed valence and thienylpolyene materials, to control                         
              intermolecular interactions and to permit measurement of materials             
              under comparable local field conditions.  Treatment of electronic              
              and nuclear dynamics as well as the details of the applied                     
              electromagnetic fields by density matrix methods permits                       
              characterization of multiple mechanisms of optical nonlinearity in             
              a single material.  Preliminary realization of large optical                   
              nonlinearities suggest that, with further optimization of material             
              properties device application of organic, inorganic and mixed                  
              valence polymers, may be practical.                                            
                                                                                             
              This research on nonlinear optical materials combines synthesis,               
              state-of-the-art characterization and measurements, and study of               
              the mechanisms of optical nonlinearity.  The grant is supported                
              jointly by the Polymers and the Solid State Chemistry components of            
              the Solid State Chemistry and Polymers Program.
