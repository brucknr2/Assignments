Abstract    :
                   This grant supports the research of Professor H. Montgomery as            
              principal investigator, Professor David Masser as a research                   
              associate and Dr. Jeffrey Thunder as a post-doctoral associate.                
              Professor Montgomery will work on problems in analytic and additive            
              number theory.  In particular, he will concentrate on sieve methods            
              and the geometric properties of the zeta function. Professor Masser            
              will work on Diophantine approximation particularly as it relates              
              to arithmetic geometry.  He will also study large period matrices              
              and endomorphism rings of Abelian varieties.  Dr. Thunder will try             
              to give explicit asymptotic estimates for the number of points of              
              bounded height on certain varieties.  He also intends to study the             
              Thue equation.                                                                 
                   This is research in the field of number theory.  Number                   
              theory starts with the whole numbers and questions such as the                 
              divisibility of one whole number by another.  It is among the                  
              oldest fields of mathematics and it was originally pursued for                 
              purely aesthetic reasons.  However, within the last half century,              
              it has become an essential tool in developing new algorithms for               
              computer science and new error correcting codes for electronics.
