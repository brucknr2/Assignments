Abstract    :
              The PI request funds to operate the new Imaging Vector                         
              Magnetograph at Mees Solar Observatory during the period of high               
              solar activity, in support of both Max '91 campaigns and                       
              individual research projects.  The goals of his individual                     
              research projects include:                                                     
              (1)  to determine from photospheric vector magnetograms whether                
                   coronal magnetic fields in flare-productive active regions                
                   are demonstrably not only non-potential, but also non-force-              
                   free, and to understand the origin of such departures;                    
              (2)  to understand the morphological relationship of photospheric              
                   magnetic fields and current systems to bulk energization and              
                   nonthermal electron acceleration and precipitation in                     
                   flares;                                                                   
              (3)  to determine the temporal dependence of Ho polarization                   
                   during flares, and to understand its relationship to                      
                   energetic protons in the ill-understood sub-Mev range.
