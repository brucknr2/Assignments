Abstract    :
                   This project will initiate studies on the evolution of                    
              maternal effects.  Mathematical models will be used to determine               
              how the strengths of maternal effects (for example, lactation in               
              mammals) evolve.  We will study how these characters respond to                
              selection and develop methods to measure their selection and                   
              inheritance in natural populations.  Specific approaches that                  
              will be used to meet these two objectives will be the extention                
              of a quantitative-genetic model recently introduced by the                     
              principal investigator and his collaborators, and the development              
              of new statistical methods for estimating the parameters that                  
              appear in the models.  Results form this work will specify the                 
              conditions under which maternal care will originate and be                     
              maintained, and empirical methods for  testing the hypotheses                  
              generated by the theory.
