Abstract    :
              The objective of the proposed cooperative project is to test                   
              the morphological relationships between the prehistoric and                    
              modern populations in the various parts of China.  The intent                  
              is to see whether the craniofacial morphology of regionally                    
              identified modern Chinese populations differs to the same --                   
              or to a greater or lesser -- degree as modern Chinese in a                     
              given area differ from their Neolithic antecedents in the                      
              same as well as in other parts of China.  Coordinated with                     
              the historical and archaeological record of population                         
              movements from one part of China to another, compared with                     
              previously collected data from past and present European                       
              populations, and considered in the perspective of data to be                   
              gathered on Amerindian samples, this should give a scale for                   
              measuring the rate of non-adaptive morphological change                        
              through time.  Ultimately this will allow the investigators                    
              to say just how long it has taken for the various differences                  
              between the major regional populations of Homo sapiens to have                 
              developed.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              This project involves collaboration with the Chinese Institute                 
              of Archaeology where the collections are housed.  This                         
              collaboration is critical to the success of the project and                    
              could yield a longer term collaborative approach to studying                   
              other Chinese collections which have been largely unavailable                  
              to US scientists.
