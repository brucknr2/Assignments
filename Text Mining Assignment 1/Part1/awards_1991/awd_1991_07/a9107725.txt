Abstract    :
              The goal is to continue the                                                    
              development of advanced numerical                                              
              methods for solving particle                                                   
              transport problems.  The new                                                   
              methods will be more accurate and                                              
              more computationally efficient than                                            
              current methods.  These advances                                               
              will be accomplished by employing                                              
              new mathematical algorithms for the                                            
              discretization and iterative

              reduction strategies for Monte                                                 
              Carlo problems, for both scalar and

              computers. For deterministic                                                   
              transport problems, asymptotic                                                 
              expansions will be used to predict                                             
              the accuracy of transport                                                      
              differencing schemes for problems                                              
              with optically thick spatial cells                                             
              and to use these asymptotic results                                            
              explicitly in a diffusion synthetic                                            
              acceleration algorithm so that                                                 
              iterative transport solutions can                                              
              be obtained very rapidly.  For                                                 
              Monte Carlo problems, a                                                        
              generalization of the exponential                                              
              transform method will be developed.                                            
              This will significantly reduce the                                             
              computational cost of Monte Carlo                                              
              calculations, making these                                                     
              calculations more accurate and less                                            
              expensive.
