Abstract    :
              An online problem is one in which an algorithm must handle a sequence          
              of requests, processing each request without knowledge of the future           
              requests.  Online problems are encountered frequently in computer              
              science.  They are especially common in computer systems and data              
              structures.  The standard method for evaluating an online algorithm is         
              called competitive analysis.                                                   
              This project has three parts.  The first is to investigate specific            
              online problems, principally from the competitive viewpoint.  These            
              problems include some well studied problems that have remained open            
              and some new problems identified in this proposal.  The second is to           
              understand the role of randomness, especially in finding simpler or            
              more efficient algorithms.  Finally, it has been observed that in              
              several applications, algorithms designed to be competitive are out-           
              performed by other, equally competitive, and sometimes non-                    
              competitive, algorithms.  To explain this behavior, the third part of          
              this project is to find a new metric for the evaluation of online              
              algorithms.  Such a metric is likely to be a refinement of competitive         
              analysis.
