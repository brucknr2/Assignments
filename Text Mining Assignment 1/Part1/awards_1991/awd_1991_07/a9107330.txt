Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Although great progress in understanding the variation in plant                
              mating systems has been made in the past century, most studies have            
              focused on the role of the negative effects of inbreeding.                     
              Recently, a different approach has been developed, one that is                 
              based on a general analysis of plant reproduction and pollination              
              biology.  It assumes that rates of self-fertilization are                      
              determined, at least in part, by the relative amount of self and               
              outcross pollen on stigmas--an assumption called the mass-action               
              assumption.  Preliminary work suggests that models incorporating               
              the mass-action assumption may be able to explain the full range               
              of observed plant mating systems, even without considering the                 
              effects of inbreeding.  This preliminary work will be extended in              
              two ways.  First, the mathematical models will be extended to                  
              include (1) a more realistic representation of the spatial                     
              structure of plant populations and (2) inbreeding depression.                  
              Second, experimental tests of the model predictions will be made               
              by taking advantage of a well studied mating system polymorphism               
              in Senecio vulgaris (1) to make direct estimates of the key                    
              features of the model in natural and experimental populations and              
              (2) to investigate the role of frequency-dependent pollen export               
              in maintenance of the variations in mating system.
