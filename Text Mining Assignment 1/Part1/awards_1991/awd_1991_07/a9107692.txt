Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Various environmental conditions including both abiotic (wind,                 
              temperature, water, soil, light, etc.) and biotic (micro-organisms,            
              viruses, insects, plants and animals) exert their influences on                
              plants.  Here, four environmental factors have been selected for               
              dicussion.  They include abiotic (water and temperature) and biotic            
              (insects and plant diseases).  Despite the evolution of natural                
              defense mechanisms, many especially food and fiber crops, still                
              experience serious losses every year due to environmental stress.              
              Recently, scientists have learned to manipulate plants to overcome             
              some of these conditions through newly discovered techniques such              
              as molecular genetics and biotechnology.  An important goal of this            
              workshop is to bring together specialists in these fields to share             
              their expertise with the plants scientists at the major                        
              Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU's).
