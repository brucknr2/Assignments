Abstract    :
              The molluscs are one of the most diverse and abundant groups of                
              animals in the world today.  An understanding of the manner in                 
              which this group has diversified in form and habitat is hampered               
              by the lack of information concerning the precise relationships and            
              ancestry among the molluscan classes.  The positions of the thirty-            
              seven genes around the circular mitochondrial DNA molecule will be             
              determined from representatives of the classes of molluscs and                 
              other animals believed to be related to molluscs on the basis of               
              anatomical characters.  These positions will be determined by DNA              
              sequencing of selected regions of the mitochondrial molecule for               
              each of the animals in the study.  This data will be combined with             
              DNA nucleotide sequencing of selected regions of the mitochondrial             
              molecule for each of the animals in the study.  This data will be              
              combined with DNA nucleotide sequence data from several of the                 
              conserved protein-coding mitochondrial genes in order to understand            
              precisely how these animals are related.  This approach, using data            
              from two different molecular levels, is appropriate when studying              
              truly ancient radiations of animals.  The results of this study                
              will form the basis for the first clear analysis of trends in the              
              form, diversity, and ecology of the molluscs.
