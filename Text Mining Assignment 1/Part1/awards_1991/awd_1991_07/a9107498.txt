Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award will support collaborative research in statistics                   
              and probability between Dr. James Marron, University of North                  
              Carolina at Chapel Hill, and Professor Wolfgang Hardle,                        
              Catholic University of Louvain, Belgium.  The objective of                     
              the research is to study bandwidth selection and construction                  
              of confidence bands/error bars for additive multivariate                       
              regression models                                                              
                                                                                             
              The proposed research concerns nonparametric regression,                       
              especially in the multivariate case.  The two main problems                    
              to be addressed are smoothing parameters (i.e. bandwidth                       
              selection) and data based assessment of the accuracy of                        
              estimators (in the spirit of confidence intervals).  Non-                      
              parametric regression provides a powerful tool for providing                   
              insights in situations where no widely accepted model is                       
              available, or where there is some doubt concerning the                         
              appropriateness of a given model.  For practical applications,                 
              the two improvements most needed are a really reliable                         
              method of bandwidth selection, and a means of assessing the                    
              variability of the estimator. Both Drs. Marron and Hardle                      
              have a strong record of past joint research, which will be of                  
              benefit to this proposed collaboration.
