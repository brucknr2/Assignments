Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A one-half day Symposium, entitled "Signaling Systems, Venoms and              
              Adhesives:  Recurring Themes and Variations", is proposed for the              
              Second International Marine Biotechnology Conference (IMBC' 91),               
              October 13-16, 1991.                                                           
                                                                                             
              The proposed Symposium assembles scientists whose studies with                 
              marine organisms make major contributions to our understanding of:             
              (1) receptor systems for exogenous chemostimulants,                            
              neurotransmitters and hormones, (2) substances inhibiting specific             
              receptors, and (3) the biosynthesis of waterproof adhesives.  These            
              seemingaly disparate subjects are integrated by recurring themes               
              apparent in receptor structure, mechanisms of transduction, and the            
              synthesis and employment of similar molecules for diverse                      
              functions.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              The following topics will be discussed:  receptor-mediated larval              
              settlement, the recurrence of a defined receptor type on echinoderm            
              spermatozoa and mammalian cells, the evolution of families of                  
              venoms blocking specific receptors and ion channels, the role of               
              peptides, steroids and prostaglandins as both endogenous hormones              
              and exogenous pheromones and the incorporation of the catechol                 
              moiety into both neurotransmitters and adhesives.  The Symposium               
              contents will be summarized and integrated by the organizers for               
              publication in the Biological Bulletin.//
