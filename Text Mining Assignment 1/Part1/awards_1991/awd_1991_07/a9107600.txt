Abstract    :
                   Professor Uribe will continue his research on problems in                 
              global analysis. In particular he will study the spectral                      
              asymptotics of elliptic operators and their relationships with                 
              symplectic geometry. One main problem is to relate the asymptotic              
              properties of the Schrodinger operator to the classical mechanics              
              of the system represented by the operator. A second problem is to              
              develop the theory of the Fourier integral operator in the                     
              setting of quantized Kahler manifolds.                                         
                   The motivation for this research comes from mathematical                  
              physics and inverse spectral problems. Inverse spectral theory                 
              tries to understand an operator by studying how the operator                   
              separates input into discrete parts. The Schrodinger operator in               
              particular plays a central role in the modeling of many physical               
              systems and a better understanding of the spectral properties of               
              this operator would have broad application.
