Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to understand the molecular mechanisms             
              that control the life cycle of Neurospora crassa.  This goal                   
              will be approached by testing the  hypothesis that regulated                   
              expression of genes at the mating type locus controls target genes             
              that effect mating type functions.  N. crassa is a haploid                     
              eukaryote, the most intensively studied filamentous Ascomycete.                
              The mating type locus of Neurospora controls heterokaryosis during             
              vegetative growth, and mating and morphological development during             
              sexual development.  During vegetative growth, the two alleles of              
              mating type, a and A, prevent formation of mixed mating type                   
              heterokaryons.  However, only opposite mating types mate and                   
              undergo sexual reproduction, a multistep process in which the                  
              mating type genes play multiple roles.  Each allele of mating type             
              contains multiple functional regions required for distinct steps.              
              One region of a encodes a polypeptide (mt a-1) critical to                     
              vegetative incompatibility and mating.  The sequence of mt a-1                 
              suggests that it is a DNA binding protein.  The role of a-2 and the            
              functions of mt a-1  and the identities of genes that interact with            
              it to control the Neurospora life cycle will be investigated by a              
              combined genetic, biochemical, and molecular genetic approach.
