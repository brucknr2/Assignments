Abstract    :
              A series of porphyrazines bearing eight ligating ring                          
              substituents (SH, OH, RNR, RPR) will be synthesized.  These                    
              ligand systems will be converted into diverse multimetal                       
              species by complexation of one metal ion within the macrocyclic                
              cavity and four metal ions to the peripheral heteroatoms.  The                 
              resultant complexes, star porphyrazines, may exhibit unusual                   
              spectroscopic and magnetic properties due to electron                          
              delocalization and metal-metal interactions via the macrocycle                 
              pi-system.

              In this project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organo-                    
              metallic Program of the Chemistry Division, Dr. Brian M.                       
              Hoffman of Northwestern University and Dr. Anthony G.M. Barrett                
              of Colorado State University will synthesize a series of macro-                
              cyclic ligands that can complex five metal ions in a star-                     
              shaped arrangement.  These metal-encapsulated complexes may                    
              have important properties such as catalytic activity, unusual                  
              magnetic behavior, and selectivity for metal ions.
