Abstract    :
                   The goal of this proposal is to address a central but poorly              
              understood topic in the evolution of life-history patterns in                  
              organisms:  whether trade-offs of one ability relative to another              
              result from trade-offs of nutritional resources at the                         
              physiological level.  Specifically, the trade-off between flight               
              capability and reproductive output of the crickets Gryllus                     
              rubens, will be considered.  Individuals of this species occur as              
              one of two genetically determined forms.  One form exhibits                    
              elevated egg production but cannot fly while the other is less                 
              fecund but is capable of flight.  The nutritional intake of the                
              two forms and the internal partitioning of nutrients among                     
              flight, reproductive and other non-flight and non-reproductive                 
              tissues in these crickets will be measured.  This study will                   
              break new ground in its effort to investigate whether there is a               
              trade-off of resources between the anatomical structures and                   
              physiological processes underlying a genetically determined                    
              trade-off seen at the level of whole organism life-history.  In                
              addition, by obtaining data on the physiological bases of                      
              dispersal and reproduction, this study will provide important                  
              background information for applied studies that attempt to                     
              control insect populations.
