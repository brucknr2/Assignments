Abstract    :
                   Research in theoretical elementary particle physics will                  
              include efforts to make contact between superstring theory and                 
              experimental physics, and to predict the experimental signals                  
              that would be expected in the presence in nature of                            
              supersymmetry.  Superstring theory is a promising candidate                    
              for a theory that describes all the forces of nature,                          
              including gravity, but determining the experimentally testable                 
              consequences of this theory is a very difficult and important                  
              problem Supersymmetry relates the behavior of particles (such                  
              as the electron) which are the constituents of matter to that                  
              of particles (such as the photon) which serve as the carriers                  
              of the various forces.  If superstring theory is right, then                   
              supersymmetry is indeed present in nature, so the consequences                 
              of this presence are important to elucidate.
