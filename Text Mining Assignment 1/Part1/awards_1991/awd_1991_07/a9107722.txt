Abstract    :
              This collaborative award, made under the Materials Chemistry                   
              and Chemical Processing Initiative is supported by the                         
              Divisions of Chemistry, Materials Research, and Chemical and                   
              Thermal Systems. New precursors will be prepared that will                     
              participate in the chemical vapor deposition of                                
              high-performance semiconductors and ceramic materials under                    
              kinetic control. Intermediates in chemical vapor deposition and                
              vapor phase epitaxy will be identified and their reactivity                    
              will be correlated with film growth. Mechanisms of film growth                 
              will also be studied. A novel reactor system will be employed                  
              permitting new approaches to the identification, and spatial                   
              and temporal monitoring of species formed upon thermal                         
              decomposition of gaseous precursor molecules at solid surfaces.

              Reactive intermediates formed from precursors used in                          
              established vapor deposition and vapor-phase epitaxy processes                 
              are largely unknown. Identifying them and monitoring their                     
              reaction rates will contribute to more effective process                       
              control and also extend to the deposition of entirely new                      
              materials.
