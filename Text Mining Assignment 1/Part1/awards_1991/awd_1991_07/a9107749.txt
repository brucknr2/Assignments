Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This grant supports about 30 graduate students in the earth               
              sciences to participate in a Symposium on Global Change Studies                
              at the American Meteorological Society's 1991 annual meeting.                  
              The Symposium includes panels on environmental science and public              
              policy and on environmental sciences and education.  Students                  
              have been selected by the Symposium Program Committee.  A                      
              written report will be required of each applicant supported.                   
                   The students will benefit additionally from participating in              
              other parts of the AMS annual meeting which has global change as               
              one of its major foci.  The stipend would allow for the full week              
              of activities.
