Abstract    :
              The funds sought in this proposal are for the acquisition of a                 
              modified one-dimensional consolidometer which has the                          
              capability of freezing and thawing the soil sample, and                        
              using an automatic loading and data acquisition system, make                   
              measurements of the hydraulic conductivity by direct and                       
              indirect means. The ultimate aim of the research is to seek                    
              methodology for minimizing changes in the hydraulic                            
              conductivity of soils when subjected to variations in                          
              environmental conditions.
