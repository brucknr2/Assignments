Abstract    :
                   This workshop will be convened to examine and discuss                     
              current theoretical understanding of the interaction of very                   
              high-intensity short-pulse laser light with electrons and                      
              atoms, and to assess the possibilities for experimental                        
              studies of new theoretical predictions.  The focus of the                      
              workshop will be on new aspects of single-electron phenomena                   
              in strong and super-strong laser fields.
