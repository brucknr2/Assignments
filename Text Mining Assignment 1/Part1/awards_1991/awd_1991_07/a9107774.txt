Abstract    :
              The proposed research program consists of two                                  
              main parts, i.e., solitary waves (ultrafast pulses)                            
              generation and switching operation in four-wave                                
              mixing.  For solitary wave generation, the medium                              
              parameters such as loss and the nonlinear factor in                            
              MQWs will be measured and their effects on the                                 
              results will be taken into account in the                                      
              experiments.  This part of the research is expected                            
              to produce effective pulse compressors for ultrafast                           
              laser spectroscopy and diagnoses, and for high-rate                            
              optical communications.  The proposed study of                                 
              switching devices will include experimental                                    
              implementations of switching in four-wave mixing                               
              with different pump formats (forward, counter-                                 
              propagation with one or two pumps).  The                                       
              dependence of the outputs of the switching                                     
              processes on the material parameters and the                                   
              control signal will be studied using samples with                              
              different parameters.  The input power                                         
              requirements, and response time of MQW devices                                 
              will be measured experimentally using different                                
              input power levels and delays between the input                                
              and output pulses.  The use of the switching devices                           
              in cascade and array formats will be demonstrated                              
              using several pieces of MQWs in the experiments.
