Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Nitrate assimilation in the fungus Neurospora, particularly the                
              steps connected with nitrite assimilation and reduction to ammonium            
              ion, is the object(s) of the proposed research.  An analysis of the            
              sequence organization and regulated expression of the nitrite                  
              reductase structural gene, "nit-6", and a comparison of its                    
              properties with those of "nit-3", its coordinately regulated                   
              partner, is an immediate goal of the research.  The information                
              obtained will be exploited in experiments designed to probe                    
              structure:activity relationships in nitrite reductase.
