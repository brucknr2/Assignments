Abstract    :
              This proposal is for an equipment grant to replace and upgrade                 
              the computer hardware of UCLA's multi-user Center for Computer-                
              based Behavioral Studies (CCBS).  The software capabilities of                 
              the CCBS facility are currently limited by the operating system                
              associated with the PDP 11/84 minicomputer that services the                   
              facility.  Purchase of new computer hardware is needed to convert              
              to a UNIX-based system that will increase the capacity and                     
              flexibility of CCBS as a multi-purpose facility.  Basic social                 
              science research projects to be supported by the new system                    
              include a program of research on small-group communication                     
              networks and information exchange; a computer-controlled                       
              factorial survey assessing perceptions of climate change and                   
              environmental policies; and a computer-assisted telephone survey               
              of mutual perceptions of ethnic minorities.
