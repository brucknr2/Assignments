Abstract    :
                   This research concerns the role of sex, parasites, and                    
              clonal diversity in observed competitive displacements among                   
              geckos in the tropical Pacific.  A wide-scale biogeographic                    
              pattern has been documented which a sexual house gecko,                        
              Hermidactylus frenatus, (Hf) upon introduction to islands in the               
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
              Pacific, replaces at least three other species as the common                   
              urban gecko.  Two of the three species (H. garnotti (g) and                    
              Lepidodactylus lugubris (L1) reproduce parthenogenetically.  In                
                                                                                             
              addition, the coral atoll of Takapoto (in the Tuomotus) is an                  
              ideal study site for a competitive displacement of  undescribed
