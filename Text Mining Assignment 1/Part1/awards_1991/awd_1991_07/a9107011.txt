Abstract    :
                   This research project examines the invariant subspace                     
              structure of multiplication operators on Hilbert spaces of analytic            
              functions.  Research will involve multiple pathologies that arise              
              on a space of the mean-square closure of the polynomials with                  
              respect to measures on the unit disk; invariant subspaces in                   
              Bergman spaces which arise from multiple boundary points; the                  
              discovery of metric criterion for the space of polynomial                      
              approximants; and the generalization of asymptotic kernel function             
              estimates of T. Trent to general Bergman spaces.                               
                   This research is in the general mathematical area called                  
              'modern analysis'.  Much of modern analysis concerns the study of              
              the spaces of functions or the analytic operators on a specified               
              space.  Modern analysis has many applications for physics and                  
              geometry.
