Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              We propose to continue our low-temperature research program on                 
              disordered mesoscopic systems and specially designed                           
              nanostructures.  The first part, which concerns quantum                        
              interference effects in transport processes, will comprise studies             
              of narrow-bandgap mesoscopic conductors and superlattice effects.              
              In addition, we envisage work on single-electron charging in a                 
              vertical tunneling structure, probing the question of "coulomb                 
              blockade" vs quantized-flux conductance effects, and developing a              
              split-gate, electrostatic AB device.                                           
                                                                                             
              Unique advances in materials fabrication and processing have given             
              accessibility to entirely new experimental systems.  This work aims            
              at a comprehensive understanding of how quantum phase interference             
              and correlated transport effects evolve in complex disordered                  
              systems.  It bears directly upon current and near-future efforts to            
              develop powerful new devices for measurement and control in science            
              and industry.
