Abstract    :
              An international symposium, entitled "The Future of the Research               
              Enterprise within the Industrialized Nations," sponsored by the                
              Government-University-Industry Research Roundtable, is being held

              in Washington, D.C.  The purposes of the symposium are (a) to                  
              assess current challenges to the research systems of the major                 
              industrialized nations, (b) to compare national strategies for                 
              meeting these challenges, and (c) to explore options for the                   
              research systems of the 21st century.  Symposium speakers are                  
              senior government science policy officials and leading scientists

              and the Soviet Union.  The symposium is a component of the                     
              comprehensive Roundtable program of activities focused on the                  
              current status of and future options for the academic research                 
              enterprise.  The proceedings of this symposium are being published
