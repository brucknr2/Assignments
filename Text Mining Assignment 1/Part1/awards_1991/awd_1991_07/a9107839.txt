Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program                 
              to the Department of Chemistry at Rutgers University will help                 
              them acquire a gas chromatograph and mass spectrometer system                  
              (GC/MS) system.  The acquisition will enhance the ability of                   
              the Department to educate students and will enhance chemical                   
              research in the following areas:  Synthetic Organic Chemistry,                 
              Research in Carbene Chemistry, Transition Metal-Catalyzed                      
              Functionalization of C-H Bonds and Structures, and Reactivities                
              of Organic Radical Cations.                                                    
                                                                                             
              The Gas Chromatograph and Mass Spectrometer (GC/MS) system                     
              separates mixtures of volatile compounds and identifies the                    
              masses of each separated component.  The GC/MS is essential                    
              when there is a need to quantify soluble compounds found in                    
              dilute solutions.  The GC/MS is useful in areas such as                        
              chemical synthesis, kinetics and structural analysis.
