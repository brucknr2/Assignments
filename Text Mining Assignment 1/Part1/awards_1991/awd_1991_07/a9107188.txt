Abstract    :
                   The focus of statistical graphics is to display dominant                  
              relationships among several variables by taking a few variables at             
              a time and plotting them or otherwise creating images.  This                   
              research will develop methods based on "caricatures" of large                  
              samples of high-dimensional data.  A perceptual study will evaluate            
              a variety of these new and other older methods of data                         
              visualization.
