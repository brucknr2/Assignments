Abstract    :
              The objectives of this research are to develop a better                        
              understanding of reinforced soil at failure; and to develop                    
              a new modeling technique of reinforced soil mass and design                    
              techniques of reinforced soil structures. Homogenization                       
              techniques will be applied to reinforced soil to produce an                    
              "equivalent anisotropic continuum." An alternative approach                    
              where reinforced soil is considered as a two-component system                  
              (applicable to sparsely reinforced soils) will also be                         
              considered. Experimental verification on reinforced soil                       
              samples in a standard triaxial test apparatus are planned.                     
              Anisotropy of failure criteria, dilatancy characteristics,                     
              and failure modes will be investigated.
