Abstract    :
                   In recent years, the field of algebraic topology has become               
              increasingly applied to problems in geometry and physics.                      
              Homotopy-theoretic techniques have yielded new insight into                    
              problems derived from gauge theory; there has been important                   
              progress in applying topological techniques to problems in modular             
              representation theory; and geometric information can now be                    
              extracted from group cohomology, which serves as a fertile common              
              ground for an exchange of ideas from representation theory, group              
              actions and stable homotopy.                                                   
                   This grant will support a conference in algebraic topology at             
              the University of Wisconsin in the fall of 1991.  The invited                  
              speakers are the top researchers in the field and the conference is            
              likely to result in fundamental advances, both in topology and in              
              the applications of topology, and in fruitful interactions between             
              the disparate fields of mathematics and mathematical physics.
