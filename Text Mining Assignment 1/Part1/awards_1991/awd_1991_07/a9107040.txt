Abstract    :
              This award funds the author's well known work on time,                         
              interaction and performance in groups and on the flow of work in               
              technologically enhanced groups.  The researcher conducts a set                
              of experiments that deal with the consequences for group                       
              interaction and task performance, of variations in communication               
              channels and modalities within work groups.  The research                      
              compares face to face groups with groups doing comparable tasks                
              in which communication is computer-mediated.  The theory guiding               
              this work contains the assumption that various forms of                        
              technological enhancement in such groups simultaneously reduce                 
              some barriers to effective group performance and impose others,                
              and that they do so by altering the informational, temporal, and               
              interactional processes by which the group does its work.  The                 
              empirical basis underlying this theoretical rationale, however,                
              consists of findings from only a very thin base of research                    
              studies, some of which have serious methodological flaws.  This                
              research conducts a series of experiments that are robust and                  
              replicable.
