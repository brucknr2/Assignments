Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The primary objective at this U.S.-Czechoslovakia research                     
              project between Dr. Timothy Keiderling of the University                       
              of Illinois and Dr. Petr Pancoska of Charles University is                     
              to determine reliable empirical interpretations of                             
              protein spectroscopic data for secondary structure.  The                       
              researchers will employ various vibrational spectroscopies,                    
              including circular dichroism.  The combination of                              
              techniques is intended to draw upon strengths of each to                       
              produce uniform systematic analysis for spectral data.                         
              The reference proteins used to calibrate the analytical                        
              methods will be those for which good crystal structure                         
              data are available.  Cluster analysis and neural network                       
              analysis will be employed to clarify inter-relationships                       
              in initial structural parameters.  Results would be                            
              linked for an optimized single computational model.  The                       
              hope is that the use of such a standard model for                              
              spectral data treatment will simplify understanding the                        
              wealth of new literature being produced on protein                             
              characterization.                                                              
                                                                                             
              This project in experimental physical chemistry fulfills                       
              the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge                        
              by enabling leading researchers in the United States and                       
              Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and pool                       
              research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and                      
              competence.
