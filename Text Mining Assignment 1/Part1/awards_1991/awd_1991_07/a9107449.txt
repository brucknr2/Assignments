Abstract    :
              Solids velocity distribution will be measured in an                            
              oscillating or continuously shearing cell, with a specially                    
              built ultrasonic Doppler velocimeter.  Liquid pore pressure                    
              will also be determined.  The objective is to obtain shear-                    
              strain relationships, and data on the effect of gravity on                     
              resettling.  The research is focused on the flow measurements                  
              in concentrated slurries, and the improvement of the                           
              ultrasonic technique for particulate flows.                                    
                                                                                             
              The ultrasonic method will for non-intrusive measurements in                   
              dense slurry flow, which may lead to fundamental findings on                   
              the two-phase flow structure.
