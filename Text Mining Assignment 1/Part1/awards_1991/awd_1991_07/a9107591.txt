Abstract    :
                   This project addresses the problem of scheduling large job                
              shops characterized by dynamic job arrivals, machine failures, due-            
              date related performance measures and different types of                       
              workcenters.  In spite of their practical importance, the                      
              difficulty of these problems has caused them to remain largely                 
              unstudied to date.  However, with the exploitation of special                  
              problem structures present in industrial contexts provides a                   
              promising approach.                                                            
                   An event classification approach to the dynamic aspects of the            
              problem is used.  It is combined with an approximation methodology             
              that can obtain near-optimal schedules for a static problem.                   
              Events affecting system state are monitored and those needing                  
              immediate attention (exceptions) are identified.  In the absence               
              of exceptions, schedules are generated periodically and implemented            
              on a rolling horizon basis.  If an exception occurs, the system is             
              rescheduled immediately.  An approximation methodology is proposed             
              to generate the schedules at the various rescheduling points.  This            
              requires the development of efficient scheduling procedures for                
              different types of workcenters, leading to the formulation of a                
              number of scheduling problems not extensively examined to date.                
              The use of a specific industrial setting, that of semiconductor                
              testing operations, as a research vehicle will enable the                      
              evaluation of the proposed research from a practical standpoint.
