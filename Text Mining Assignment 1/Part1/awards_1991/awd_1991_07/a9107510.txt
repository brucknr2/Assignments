Abstract    :
                   Prior work has documented a change in host-plant preference               
              over the last ten years in a population of an herbivorous                      
              butterfly.  This population has incorporated a European weed into              
              its diet.  Comparing the preference of insects for plants                      
              maintained in laboratory culture for ten years will test whether               
              the change is due to adaptation by the insect or to a change in                
              the plant that has increased its acceptability.  Similarly, the                
              fact that different populations of this insect exhibit different               
              preferences could be due to genetic variation in the insect                    
              (already shown) or variation in the plants, or both.  The                      
              potential contribution of variation in plant acceptability to                  
              this geographic variation will be quantified.  The results of                  
              this research will show how the complexity of insect diet in time              
              and space arises from past and present insect-plant interactions.              
              The information has implications for biological pest control as                
              a model for insect invasions of agricultural habitats.
