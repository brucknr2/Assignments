Abstract    :
                   This research addresses a wide variety of interrelated                    
              problems concerning extremes, sums of dependent variables and                  
              stable processes. Many of these mathematical problems have                     
              important practical applications.  The research focusses on the                
              estimation of the distributions of extremes and uses as its                    
              principal tool the weak convergence of a point process which                   
              records the  extremes.  The research in statistical inference for              
              extreme values includes investigation of properties of the                     
              extremal index and estimation of marginal tail distributions for               
              weakly dependent variables; the research on asymptotic theory for              
              sums of dependent variables seeks to define large classes of                   
              processes for which convergence can be established; and problems               
              in inference for stable processes considers harmonizable stable                
              processes and the moving average stable process.
