Abstract    :
              As the most primitive living lineages of embryophytes, bryophytes              
              are critical to an understanding of the phylogeny of the land                  
              flora.  A relatively robust cladogram already exists for the plants            
              based on morphology and chemistry.  However, several aspects of                
              their phylogenetic relationships appear unclear.  The aim of this              
              project is to obtain nuclei acid sequences from a large sample of              
              bryophyte chloroplasts and to use these in developing and testing              
              hypotheses about their phylogeny.  Two rRNA and rbcL genes will be             
              sequenced for a broad array of species representing most                       
              phylogenetic lineages.  The PIs also intend to use these data sets             
              and analyses to explore various attributes of the interactions of              
              cladistic methods and types of data.  Thus, a better understanding             
              of both the bryophytes and the methods and applications of                     
              cladistics should be derived from this study.
