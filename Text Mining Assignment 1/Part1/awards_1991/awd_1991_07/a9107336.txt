Abstract    :
                   This project is concerned with several problems in complex                
              variables that are of interest in their own right and in                       
              connection with problems in the geometry of planar sets.                       
                   The first set of problems deals with the iteration theory of              
              meromorphic functions in the plane.  The main question proposed                
              for study here asks if the Julia set of any rational function and              
              of a suitable entire or meromorphic function is uniformly                      
              perfect.  This is tantamount to asking if the Julia set has a                  
              uniform lower bound for the local density of its logarithmic                   
              capacity.                                                                      
                   The second set of problems deals with the question of under               
              what circumstances a convergence group in the plane is                         
              topologically conjugate to a Moebius group.                                    
                   The third set of problems involves the study of analytic                  
              inequalities that arise in the theory of Markov processes.
