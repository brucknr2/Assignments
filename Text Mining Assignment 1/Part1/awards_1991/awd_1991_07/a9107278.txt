Abstract    :
              A single celled alga, (the diatom Stephanodiscus yellowstonensis)              
              originated in Yellowstone Lake, Wyoming from about 12,000 to 8,000             
              years ago, apparently from its nearest relative, S. niagarae which             
              lives in nearby lakes.  The significance of the research goes far              
              beyond a detailed description of diatom speciation.  The proposed              
              research speaks to a broad range of questions from factors                     
              controlling origin of new species to global climate change.  The               
              project integrates 3 lines of evidence: paleontological,                       
              morphological, and genetic.  Sediment records from some of the                 
              largest high altitude lakes in the world (Yellowstone Lake and                 
              Jackson Lake in northwestern Wyoming and a series of lakes between             
              them) will be collected.  From these sediment records a detailed               
              record of regional climatic change (using pollen, diatoms, oxygen              
              isotope, grain size and other features as available) will be                   
              obtained.  The information will be compared to an extraordinarily              
              well detailed and CONTINUOUS record of this new species within a               
              4,000 year period (the early Holocene, a time of significant global            
              warming).  Among other results, we expect to obtain a detailed                 
              record of change in species as a response to entire ecosystem                  
              change in response to global warming.  This study will help serve              
              as a basis for predicting changes in the earth's biota in response             
              to possible future global change, anthropogenic and/or natural.
