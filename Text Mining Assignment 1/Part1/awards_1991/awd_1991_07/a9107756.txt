Abstract    :
                   This proposed project addresses a very important educational              
              issue and a major NSF concern (minorities in the science and                   
              mathematics pipeline).  The topic of non-traditional paths to                  
              science and mathematics doctorates needs to be studied                         
              systematically, and the proposed project represents a good first               
              step in that direction.  The national data base analysis and                   
              interviews with minority doctorate recipients should be                        
              illuminating.  Ideally, they will spawn hypotheses that will serve             
              as the foundation for more non-doctoral minority personnel who work            
              in science/mathematics areas in corporations or the military also              
              have potential to yield some important findings.//
