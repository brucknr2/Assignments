Abstract    :
              This project is the second part of a comprehensive revision of the             
              tiphiid  wasp subfamily Thynninae.  Thynninae includes more than               
              50 genera and 750 described species.  Probably 30% of the genera               
              and species remain undescribed.  These wasps occur in South America            
              and Australasia, apparently having reached both regions via land               
              bridge connections with Antarctica some 75 million years ago.  They            
              are parasites of ground-dwelling scarab beetles, including those               
              related to the Japanese Beetle.  The transantarctic distribution,              
              and distinctive relationship between morphology, taxonomy and                  
              behavior makes this group of wasps ideal for analyses of their                 
              evolution and distribution.  Taxonomic and evolutionary analyses               
              have been completed for the South American groups.  The proposed               
              research in this project on thynnines includes evolutionary                    
              analysis of the Australasian genera, and then overall evolutionary             
              and biogeographic analyses of the entire subfamily worldwide.
