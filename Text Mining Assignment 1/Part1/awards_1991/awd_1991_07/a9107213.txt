Abstract    :
                   Research is proposed to develop the methods needed to use a               
              portable infra-red gas analyzer (IRGA), presently used by plant                
              physiologists to measure photosynthetic rates in the field, as a               
              means of obtaining rapid and reliable measurements of metabolic                
              rates (MR) of avian eggs under field conditions.  If this new use              
              of an old method is successful it will allow biologists to obtain              
              reliable measurements of MR without making a significant impact                
              on the populations being studied; eggs (or other organisms for                 
              the matter) will not have to be taken back to a lab to obtain the              
              desired data.  This capability will have a significant effect on               
              design and execution of a wide range of field ecological                       
              experiments.//
