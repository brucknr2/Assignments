Abstract    :
                   An electron impact double ionization experiment with                      
              complete determination of the electron kinematics of all three                 
              outgoing electrons measured in coincidence, will be developed and              
              applied to investigations of collisions of electrons with                      
              alkaline earth atoms.  The experiments will be carried out in an               
              energy regime in which the plane wave impulse approximation can                
              be used as the basis for comparison with experimental                          
              predictions.  The experimental results will provide new                        
              understanding of electron-electron interactions (correlations)                 
              and their effects on orbital motion of electrons.
