Abstract    :
              It is the objective of this proposal to demonstrate the                        
              successful growth of a heteroepitaxial thin diamond                            
              film on a silicon substrate, using a combination of                            
              reactive, biased, laser ablation and microwave CVD                             
              techniques.  It is proposed that this will be                                  
              accomplished through the use of two interfacial                                
              layers.  The first interfacial layer will be an epitaxial                      
              cubic boron nitride layer, formed on the silicon                               
              surface, to act as a lattice matching layer between                            
              diamond and silicon.  The second interface layer,                              
              applied to the surface of the cubic boron nitride                              
              layer, applied to the surface of the cubic boron                               
              nitride layer, will be an ultra-thin, reactive laser                           
              ablated carbon layer to achieve passivation of the                             
              cubic boron nitride surface and act as a nucleation                            
              layer for diamond growth.  Once the silicon substrate                          
              is properly prepared with the laser ablated films, a                           
              thin heteroepitaxial diamond film will be grown by                             
              microwave CVD.
