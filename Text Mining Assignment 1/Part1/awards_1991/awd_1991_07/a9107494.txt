Abstract    :
                   Three detection systems which have been developed in part at              
              the University of Denver will be further developed and                         
              investigated in terms of their ability to determine the flux of                
              species to and from the atmosphere.  Long-path UV (LPUV)                       
              spectroscopy will be coupled with long-path IR (LPIR)                          
              spectroscopy and used to determine the fluxes of various species.              
              A fast response in-situ total sulfur monitor will also be                      
              optimized for response speed and sensitivity.  It will be used                 
              for flux studies by means of the eddy-correlation technique.                   
              Some of the flux studies will be carried out in collaboration                  
              with the NCAR ASTER facility and Argonne National Laboratory.                  
                   An atmospheric pressure flow system, free radical detector                
              has been developed which is shown to respond to concentrations of              
              HO2 and RO2 radicals.  This apparatus, named PERCA (PEroxy                     
              Radical detector using Chemical Amplification) has been shown to               
              respond to a number of hydrocarbon and oxygenated hydrocarbon                  
              peroxy radicals up to C8.  Using the PERCA, further studies will               
              be conducted to overcome the inability to obtain stable                        
              calibrations.
