Abstract    :
                   Previous work on photoeffect calculations will be                         
              extended to provide information concerning open shell atoms                    
              and large Z atoms and ions.  Attention will also be given to                   
              ionization plus excitation phenomena and to the study of                       
              electron spectra obtained in ion-atom collisions.  The overall                 
              aim is to provide a basic understanding of the physical                        
              phenomena involved in a particular process using the simplest                  
              calculational procedure possible.
