Abstract    :
                   Dr. Donald Pfister is the Director of the Harvard University              
              Herbaria, which together comprise the largest university-based                 
              plant collection in the U.S.  The Herbaria contain approximately               
              5 million plant specimens, and the collections are actively used               
              by visiting investigators and through specimen loan and exchange               
              traffic.  Dr. Pfister proposes to continue the current service to              
              the research community (loan and exchange program, handling                    
              visitors and data queries), to create an integrated computer                   
              database for the Gray Card Index of plant names (320,000 records)              
              and the Harvard vascular type specimens (80,000 records), and to               
              install compactor storage units for a portion of the collection.               
                   The proposed collection improvement projects will                         
              significantly enhance the research impact of this internationally              
              important collection.  The new specimen storage systems will                   
              alleviate crowding and accommodate future growth, and the                      
              computerization efforts will greatly increase the community's                  
              access to the specimens and their associated data.  Reference                  
              collections such as these are the primary research tool for many               
              biological disciplines, and the continued growth and improvement               
              of these collections is vital for future generations of research.
