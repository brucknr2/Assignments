Abstract    :
              The limited host range (LHR) biovar strains of Agrobacterium                   
              tumefaciens form tumors on grapevine but on virtually no other                 
              plants.  Wide host range strains (WHR) fail to induce tumors on                
              grapevine, but often induce necrosis at the site of inoculation.               
              We hope to understand the molecular basis of these several                     
              different interactions of LHR and WHR Agrobacterium strains with               
              grapevines as a model system for plant microbe interactions.  These            
              studies build on the physical and functional divergence of the VirA            
              protein in each strain and the critical role this protein plays in             
              plant signal transduction and plant cell transformation.  To                   
              distinguish transformation from tumor formation, the biological                
              assays for plant cell transformation will be performed using a                 
              binary vector system carrying a B-glucuronidase gene behind a 35A              
              CaMV promoter.  To demonstrate the significance of the four domains            
              of VirA with host range, we will exchange domains between WHR and              
              LHR strains and observe the biological consequences.  We will                  
              isolate and identify compounds in grapevines that induce vir genes             
              in LHR and WHR strains and determine their sites of interaction                
              with the VirA protein.  The locus responsible for inducing the                 
              necrotic response in grapevines will be identified by mutant                   
              analysis of T-DNA.
