Abstract    :
                   A classical focus of statistics is estimation of the accuracy             
              or error of statistical procedures; currently, attention to this               
              problem is directed at measuring accuracy after data have been                 
              obtained.  By developing the underlying mathematical theory this               
              research examines post-data inference and derives the properties of            
              data dependent measures of accuracy.  In addition, ancillarity                 
              paradoxes will be examined in which conditioning upon observed                 
              sample size within subgroup leads to inadmissibility of the usual              
              estimators.  The possibility of constructing and verifying                     
              dominating estimators will be investigated.
