Abstract    :
              This research is developing languages and mechanisms for                       
              restructuring and merging information from disparate databases,                
              and is studying the theoretical foundations of such languages.The              
              research uses the PI's formally defined ILOG languages, which                  
              permit the declarative specification of database restructuring.                
              Certain technical properties of these languagesprovide a strong                
              connection to logic programming.  The research is also developing              
              extensions to ILOG for data merging; a central problem here                    
              involves determining when object identifiers (OIDs) in two or                  
              more distinct databases refer to the same object "in the world",               
              and developing appropriate mechanisms for "merging" the OIDs in                
              this case.  Specific theoretical questions under study include:                
              attempting to characterize when two (restructuring or merging)                 
              programs are equivalent; exploring algebraic properties of                     
              programs (e.g., associativity, distributivity);developing                      
              algorithms for the translation of queries against restructured,                
              merged databases; and for incrementally updating such databases                
              if they are materialized.  Experimental work will be performed to              
              test the algorithms and view update methodologiesunder realistic               
              conditions.  The results obtained by the researchwill provide a                
              crucial component for all database applications which involve                  
              data sharing.
