Abstract    :
                   Larix, a deciduous conifer, is abundant in high montane,                  
              subalpine, and boreal forests throughout the Northern                          
              Hemisphere.  The widespread importance of larch in cold-temperate              
              montane and boreal forests and its similar canopy architecture                 
              needle morphology and water conducting system to evergreen                     
              conifers makes larch an ideal species to elucidate the influence               
              of leaf habit (e.g., evergreen vs. deciduous) on carbon balance                
              and nutrient use.  The principal investigators propose to                      
              contrast the carbon and nutrient use of Larix occidentals and                  
              Pinus contorta in high montane forests in Montana and Larix                    
              laricina and Picea mariana in boreal forests in Wisconsin.  The                
              major hypotheses are: (1) aboveground net primary production is                
              equal or greater for larch than sympatric evergreen conifers,                  
              (2) total (above-and belowground) net primary production is                    
              similar for larch and sympatric evergreen conifers because (3)                 
              belowground net primary production in larch is less than in                    
              evergreen conifers.  Lastly, they speculate (4) larch uses                     
              nitrogen more efficiently (leaf, canopy, and stand-level) than                 
              evergreen conifers.  These hypotheses lead to several corollary                
              hypotheses predicting the role of physiological and architectural              
              traits that enable larch to successfully complete with evergreen               
              conifers.
