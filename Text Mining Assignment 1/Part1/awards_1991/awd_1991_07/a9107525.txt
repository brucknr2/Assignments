Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              Chemical Oceanography is increasingly becoming a global                        
              science.  In order to foster communication and interaction with                
              scientists throughout the globe, this action provides support                  
              for travel of fifteen foreign scientists to the 1991 Gordon                    
              Research Conference.  Over the years the Gordon Research                       
              Conference in Chemical Oceanography has become one of the major                
              forums for discussion and the exchange of ideas and information                
              in the field of marine chemistry.  Approximately 100 scientists                
              from all over the United States attend this meeting.  In                       
              addition, in recent years, students nearing completion of their                
              graduate work have also been invited.  This year the theme of                  
              the conference will be "Chemistry at Oceanic Interfaces - An                   
              Interdisciplinary Approach."
