Abstract    :
                   The work will carry out research on exactly solvable                      
              models for quantum and classical systems.  Emphasis is put on                  
              studying correlation functions for the 1-d Hubbard model and                   
              the Sine-Gordon model.  Connections to conformal field theory                  
              and quantum groups will be explored.
