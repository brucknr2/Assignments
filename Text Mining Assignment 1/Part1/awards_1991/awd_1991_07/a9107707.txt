Abstract    :
                      This project is concerned with research on Witt rings and              
              quadratic forms.  The principal investigator will focus on the                 
              computation of Witt kernels for algebraic and transcendental field             
              extensions.  He will also continue his work on the theory of                   
              semidefinite polynomials and sums of even powers in rational                   
              function fields over a real-closed field, with particular attention            
              to quantitative questions on the higher pythagoras numbers of such             
              fields.  In another direction, he will carry out further                       
              investigations on Ore extensions over division rings, in the hope              
              that this will shed some light on the structure of division rings              
              themselves.                                                                    
                      The research supported involves the theory of quadratic                
              forms. This, in its simplest form, is the study of polynomial forms            
              of degree two.  Equivalently, it is an analysis of the types of                
              inner products that can define the metric geometry of an                       
              n-dimensional vector space.
