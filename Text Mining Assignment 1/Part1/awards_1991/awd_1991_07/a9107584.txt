Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This project is a collaborative research effort in Poland                 
              and the Ukraine, testing the generality of a theory already well               
              documented with data from the U.S. and Japan.  The theory descri-              
              bes relations between social structure and intellectual function-              
              ing.   In particular, the theory explains why individuals working              
              in more bureaucratic organizations display greater creativity and              
              intellectual flexibility than those in less bureaucratic environ-              
              ments.  This project explores the generality of the theory,                    
              cross-culturally and across time.  Because the theory has been                 
              tested in advanced industrial societies, an important question is              
              whether it also will be confirmed in the more agricultural and                 
              pre-industrial Ukraine and Poland.   Second, because data were                 
              collected in Poland in 1970, replication of the earlier study                  
              permits a before-and-after design to study effects of the recent               
              social and economic changes in Poland.  Results of this project                
              include expanding the scope of one of the most influential                     
              theories in sociological thought, and increased understanding of               
              the consequences of the capitalist revolutions of 1989 and 1990.
