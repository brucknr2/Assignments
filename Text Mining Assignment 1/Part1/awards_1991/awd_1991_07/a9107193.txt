Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a study of the relaxation mechanisms in highly non-                    
              equilibrium glass structures. X-ray diffraction, Raman and Infrared            
              spectroscopy, and Differential Scanning Calorimetry will be used to            
              follow structural changes during annealing of rapidly quenched                 
              germania, boria, and silica glass fibers. The experimental results             
              will be analyzed using a new phenomenological model which will be              
              derived to address the inadequacies of current equilibrium models              
              for highly non-equilibrium systems. The improved model together                
              with data on structural changes and the corresponding enthalpy                 
              relaxation will lead to a better understanding of the microscopic              
              mechanisms in structural relaxation phenomenon in oxide glasses.               
              Understanding relaxation is essential for the development of new               
              important glasses for the communication technology.
