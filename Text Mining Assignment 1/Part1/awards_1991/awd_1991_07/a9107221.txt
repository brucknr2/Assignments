Abstract    :
                   A user mode research program will be carried out in                       
              fundamental radiative capture reactions.  The experimental                     
              studies will be conducted at TRIUMF in Canada, involving                       
              radiative capture of pions on polarized protons, and at KEK,                   
              involving radiative neutron-proton capture at high energies.                   
              The pion work will improve our understanding of the photopion                  
              production cross section and shed light on the underlying                      
              quark sub-structure and interactions in nucleons.  The                         
              neutron-proton capture work will provide new data addressing                   
              alternative descriptions of the np system in terms of quarks                   
              or meson-nucleon degrees of freedom.  Simulations, data                        
              analysis, interpretation, and other related activities will be                 
              carried out at the University of Kentucky.
