Abstract    :
              The Johns Hopkins University and University of Rhode Island                    
              will undertake a collaborative, multidisciplinary instru-                      
              mentation development project to develop and implement a                       
              means of increasing capabilities to resolve interactions                       
              between particles and small scale physical processes in the                    
              ocean by simultaneously measuring particle properties and                      
              small scale motions of the fluid surrounding it.                               
                                                                                             
              The project involves laser optic holography and fluid                          
              mechanics methods to derive information about plankton                         
              dynamics and particle characterization.  A pulsed ruby laser                   
              holocamera will be modified for use in the ocean and will                      
              use recent advances in holography and digital image                            
              processing. Design criteria call for in situ measurement of                    
              particle number, size, distribution, type, and orientation                     
              and inter-particle distances over a size range of 10 microns                   
              to 5 cm. Instantaneous velocity of all particles within a                      
              sample volume would also be measured by adapting triple-                       
              pulse techniques used for motion sensing within laser                          
              sheets.  The proposed instrument will be usable in the                         
              laboratory or in the field, when attached to a submersible.                    
                                                                                             
              The development of a motion sensing holocamera is driven by                    
              a growing recognition that a new class of instruments is                       
              required to address a series of critical questions in ocean                    
              science and marine fluid mechanics.  Presently available                       
              instrumentation is inadequate to address and test hypotheses                   
              concerning complex physical-particle interactions of                           
              plankton dynamics and boundary layer fluid dynamics.
