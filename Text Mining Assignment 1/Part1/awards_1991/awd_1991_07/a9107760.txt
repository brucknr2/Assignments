Abstract    :
              This research is developing techniques for reducing the occurrence             
              of run-time errors in circuits and systems.  Emphasis is on                    
              preventing the introduction of faults into the system through                  
              verification and synthesis techniques, and on improving the                    
              detection and diagnosis of faults causing run-time errors so that              
              the faults can be removed from the system.  Topics being pursued               
              are: 1. Developing synthesis methods that automatically synthesize             
              a synchronous, register-transfer level (RTL) hardware specification            
              from a behavioral VHDL language specification; 2. determining what             
              coverage of multiple stuck-at faults or bridging faults can be                 
              expected or guaranteed by a test for delay faults in an arbitrary              
              circuits; 3. investigating methods for utilizing the use of output             
              waveform characteristics in delay testing; and 4. finding fault                
              models for intermittent failures, and methods to detect their                  
              presence.
