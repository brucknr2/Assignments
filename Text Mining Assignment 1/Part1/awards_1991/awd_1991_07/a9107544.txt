Abstract    :
                 Professor Zilm is supported by a grant for exploratory                      
              research from the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to                   
              develop the NMR methods which would take advantage of the newly                
              discovered optical polarization techniques for producing nearly                
              perfectly spin-polarized Xe-129 nuclei in xenon gas.  In                       
              principle, the transfer of this polarization to nuclei in a                    
              molecule in a solid xenon matrix can be achieved for                           
              enhancement of the NMR signals by up to four orders of                         
              magnitude.  These novel experiments are expected to have high                  
              impact on the detection of orders of magnitude smaller                         
              concentrations of molecules in xenon matrix isolation.  This                   
              would mean that reactive species which are created in very                     
              small steady state quantities in a chemical reaction could be                  
              detected with NMR, providing detailed structural information.                  
              This would also mean that low sensitivity nuclei, such as                      
              naturally abundant carbon-13 and silicon-29 could be observed                  
              even at these low concentrations.                                              
              %%%                                                                            
              This exploratory research project will make use of the just                    
              discovered method of completely polarizing the nuclear spins in                
              xenon by using the xenon to transfer polarization to other                     
              nuclei, thus enhancing their nuclear magnetic resonance spectra                
              by ten thousand fold.  The preliminary experiments will                        
              determine the conditions that are necessary for the efficient                  
              polarization transfer. The xenon could be used as a solid                      
              matrix for the detection of very small amounts of reactive                     
              molecules and molecule fragments.  The xenon can also be laid                  
              down on a surface to allow the detection of only surface atoms.
