Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              It is proposed to study the low-temperature magnetic properties of             
              several highly symmetric structures containing rare-earth and/or               
              transition-metal ions.  They aim to:  a) provide stringent tests of            
              theoretical predictions for the ordered state of purely dipolar                
              magnets with high symmetry, particularly cubic lattices, b) explore            
              magnetic order in some new cubic materials containing two competing            
              sublattices of ions, one with primarily dipolar interactions, the              
              other with "exchange"; and c) test recent predictions of "order                
              induced by disorder" in frustrated exchange-coupled systems,                   
              focusing on f.c.c. Heisenberg antiferromagnets.
