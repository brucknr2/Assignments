Abstract    :
              The Seventh Conversation in Biomolecular Stereodynamics will be                
              held in June at SUNY/Albany.  Started in 1979, then repeated every             
              two years, the conference has become a main event to discuss and               
              debate the developing ideas and discoveries in the broad context               
              of biological structure, dynamics, interactions and expression.                
              Over 500 scientists from 15 countries participated in the last                 
              meeting.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              The following areas will be covered:  1) RNA structure and                     
              activity; 2) DNA protein modular structural motifs; 3) protein-                
              nucleic acid interactions; 4) protein structure; 5) DNA structure              
              & dynamics; 6) unusual DNA-drug interactions; 7) DNA damage and                
              repair; and 8) DNA footprinting.  Every effort will be made to                 
              devote a significant part of the time to talks by graduate                     
              students, postdoctorals and young faculty.  The main lectures will             
              be published within a year of the meeting as the Proceeding of the             
              Seventh Conversation.
