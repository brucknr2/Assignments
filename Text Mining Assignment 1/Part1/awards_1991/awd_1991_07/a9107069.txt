Abstract    :
              A number of Chlorophyte algae have lost the ability to                         
              photosynthesize, and live as obligate heterotrophs identified by               
              their lack of chlorophyll.  Among these are the species called                 
              Polytoma which are very similar to the genus Chlamydomonas except              
              for the lack of chlorophyll.  Nonphotosynthetic mutants of                     
              facultative heterotrophic Chlamydomonadaceae are easily obtained,              
              and Polytoma species presumably descended from one or more such                
              mutants. Polytoma retains a plastid with DNA and functional                    
              ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes.  We have undertaken a long-range study             
              to determine the molecular phylogenetic relationships of Polytoma              
              species to green algae, determine how frequently obligate                      
              heterotroph species arise, and estimate how long heterotrophic                 
              clades survive and how often they produce new clades.  Our nuclear             
              and a plastid rRNA gene sequences from P. uvella show that this                
              species lies within one branch of Chlamydomonas, closely related               
              to C. humicola.  Now we propose to sequence the small nuclear and              
              large plastid rRNA genes from the strains of Polytoma now in                   
              culture, determine the phylogenetic relationships of these stocks              
              to the species of Chlamydomonadaceae for which rRNA genes are being            
              sequenced in other laboratories, and begin collecting new stocks               
              of Polytoma from nature for future studies.
