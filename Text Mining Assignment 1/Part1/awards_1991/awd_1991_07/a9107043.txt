Abstract    :
              This four year study is designed to accumulate and examine external            
              morphological, cytological, and developmental data from                        
              representatives of different dinoflagellate groups.  The                       
              dinoflagellate algae are very peculiar organisms that possess                  
              several more variations in their cells than do the majority of                 
              eukaryotic algae and protozoa.  Specifically, we propose to test               
              traditional systematic concepts of the dinoflagellates with these              
              data via cladistic analyses of the data we have at hand, those from            
              collaborative laboratories, and those we propose to obtain.  These             
              data will also allow us to test current and previous opinion                   
              concerning the natural relationships of the dinoflagellates and the            
              other protistan groups.  This proposal represents one of the first             
              integrative approaches toward deciphering the affinities of the                
              dinoflagellates.  Another important aspect of the proposed studies             
              is to investigate the nature of peculiar dinoflagellates found only            
              from remote marine and freshwater locations in North America and               
              to compare these taxa with those from culture collections.
