Abstract    :
              The origins of continental biotas are much less well-known than                
              are those of islands.  This results in large part from the                     
              complexity of continental faunas.  The PI intends to develop                   
              rigorous phylogenies for three widespread and diverse genera of                
              rodents (Perognathus, Chaetodipus and Onychomys), and to infer                 
              patterns of migration, speciation, and extinction based on those               
              phylogenies.  The primary tools for development of the phylogenies             
              are parsimony analysis based on mtDNA sequences.  This will also               
              permit the PI to explore processes of speciation.
