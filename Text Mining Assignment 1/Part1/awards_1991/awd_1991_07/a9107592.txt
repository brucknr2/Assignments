Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will conduct research on several               
              problems about the asymptotics of the Lyapunov spectrum and                    
              stabilization by noise.  Lyapunov exponents of random                          
              differential equations characterize the exponential divergence of              
              solutions to such equations.  The research involves several                    
              fields of mathematics: probability, differential equations,                    
              control theory and ergodic theory, and is relevant to applied                  
              engineering problems.  The specific problems are noise dependence              
              of the p'th moment Lyapunov exponent, invariant probability                    
              measures and the Lyapunov exponents in non-Markovian situations,               
              stabilizing effects of noise in linear and nonlinear systems, and              
              by computer simulations numerics for estimating rotation numbers,              
              as well as pathwise and moment, Lyapunov exponents.
