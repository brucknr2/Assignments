Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              X-ray standing waves and surface diffraction, along with                       
              electrochemical techniques, will be used to study solid-liquid                 
              interfaces of deliberate architecture.  The study will include an              
              emphasis on the potential dependent structural changes and ionic               
              permeation of phospholipid membrances on electrodes, and on redox              
              active self assembling and Langmuir-Blodgett monolayers on                     
              electrodes.
