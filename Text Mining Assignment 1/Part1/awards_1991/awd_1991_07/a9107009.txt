Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Technical Narrative:                                                           
                                                                                             
              This U.S.-Egypt collaborative research project involving                       
              Washington State University and Cairo University is in the                     
              general area of water resources engineering.  Project funding                  
              will allow a highly qualified researcher from Egypt to spend one               
              year in the laboratory of Dr. M. Hanif Chaudhry at Washington                  
              State University.  The collaborative research will investigate                 
              experimentally and theoretically the modelling of unsteady flows.              
              Computer models are expected to analyze these flows accurately                 
              for the design and operation of various flow-conveyance                        
              structures.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              This project in water resources engineering fulfills the program               
              objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading                
              experts in the United States and Egypt to combine complementary                
              talents and pool research resources in areas of strong mutual                  
              interest and competence.
