Abstract    :
                   Matic will study a theory of moduli spaces of anti-self-dual              
              connections for pairs, and a Yang-Mills theory for parabolic                   
              stable bundles in dimensions four and two.  She will also work on              
              Floer homology for rational homology spheres.                                  
                   This project also includes partial support for the annual                 
              Georgia Topology Conference.                                                   
                   Matic's research combines theoretical physics with topology               
              and differential geometry in the following way.  The physics                   
              concerns topological quantum field theories.  These lead to                    
              invariants of the underlying spaces on which they are defined.                 
              Although differential geometric constructions are involved as                  
              intermediaries, in the end quantities are derived which depend                 
              only on the topological and not the geometric character of the                 
              spaces.
