Abstract    :
              This project deals with molecularly complex liquid crystals,                   
              including nematic polymer liquid crystals such as poly-y-benzyl                
              glutamate (PBG), rigid rod viral liquid crystals (tobacco mosaic               
              virus (TMV)), and certain highly prolate filamentous bacteriophages            
              (fd and m13).  All of these materials display partially ordered                
              fluid phases, whose mechanical, magnetic, structural, optical and              
              statistical mechanical properties are of interest.  The research               
              concentrates on new phenomena and new systems, at both the                     
              microscopic and macroscopic levels.  The structural studies aid in             
              determining phase diagrams, and understanding these diagrams in                
              terms of molecular properties.  Macroscopic nonlinear phenomena are            
              being studied and these results have implications for the                      
              understanding of nonlinear processes in other systems.  Such                   
              investigations have historically led to important practical                    
              applications.  Novel experiments include combined use of magnetic              
              fields and rotational motion to induce new ordered phases, as well             
              as shear induced nematic ordering as an example of a dynamic phase             
              transition.
