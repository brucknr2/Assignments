Abstract    :
                   Recently Doedel and the investigator have developed an                    
              accurate, robust, and systematic method for computing branches of              
              heteroclinic orbits for a system of autonomous ordinary                        
              differential equations in the case that the solution approaches                
              the fixed points exponentially, and they implemented the method                
              in the software package AUTO.  In this project the investigator                
              extends the above results in several directions: 1) developing                 
              higher order approximation of the unstable and stable manifolds,               
              which is especially useful in the case when during the                         
              continuation process the exponential rate of decay is lost, i.e.               
              a center manifold appears; 2) considering several problems with                
              bifurcations of homoclinic and heteroclinic orbits, including the              
              case of center manifolds, 3) developing a posteriori error                     
              estimates and the adaptive procedure.  The goal is to lay the                  
              foundation for adaptive techniques that are essential in the                   
              development of robust and reliable software for the global                     
              analysis of homoclinic and heteroclinic orbits.                                
                   The existence of a trajectory connecting fixed points of an               
              ordinary differential equation, a homoclinic or heteroclinic                   
              orbit, is of special significance in a variety of applications.                
              These trajectories have been shown to underlie the phenomena of                
              intermittency in fluid mechanics and of "bursting" phenomena in                
              mathematical biology; they appear in the chaotic behavior of                   
              electrical circuits, of lasers as well as light pulses in                      
              fiberoptics applications; they arise in chaotic behavior in                    
              structural mechanics and in a variety of chemical reactions where              
              chaoticoscillations in the reactant concentrations are due to the              
              presence of a homoclinic orbit.
