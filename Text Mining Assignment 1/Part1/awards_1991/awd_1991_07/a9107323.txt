Abstract    :
                   Professors Kaplan and Cattani will investigate several                    
              questions concerning the properties of flat holomorphic bundles                
              carrying additional structures such as polarized variation of Hodge            
              structure or a Higgs field. They plan to study the local monodromy             
              of such bundles with applications to the fine structure of modular             
              varieties, the characterization of maximal variations of Hodge                 
              structure, and the construction of harmonic metrics.                           
                   This research lies at the interface of algebraic and                      
              differential geometry. The objects under study are algebraic                   
              varieties, essentially the zero sets of polynomials, but the                   
              methods used to study these objects are analytic. This mix of                  
              algebraic and differential geometry has been particularly                      
              successful in attacking problems which did not yield to purely                 
              algebraic methods.
