Abstract    :
              This award will support U.S.-Greece cooperative                                
              research between a group headed by Prof. Jerry Bona                            
              of Penn State University and a similar group headed                            
              by Prof. Vassilios A. Dougalis of the University of                            
              Crete, Greece.  The collaborators intend to conduct                            
              computational and theoretical research on numerical                            
              methods for solving two important nonlinear partial                            
              differential equations: the nonlinear Schroedinger                             
              equation and the Korteweg-de Vries equation.                                   
                                                                                             
              Over the past few years the collaborators have                                 
              produced several important papers on the numerical                             
              solution of the mentioned partial differential                                 
              equations.  These equations are valued because they                            
              help to model certain nonlinear wave phenomena that                            
              occur in areas of applications such as water waves,                            
              plasma physics and nonlinear optics.  By supporting                            
              the interaction of these experienced and productive                            
              collaborators, this award will help to advance our                             
              understanding of nonlinear phenomena.
