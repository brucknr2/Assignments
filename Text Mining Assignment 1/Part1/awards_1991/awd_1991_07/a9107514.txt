Abstract    :
                   Mathematical Physics is a vibrant area which deals with the               
              mathematical analysis of problems motivated by physics.  It has                
              enriched many disciplines in Mathematics, and has made lasting                 
              contributions to various areas of Physics.  The Congress of the                
              International Association of Mathematical Physics (IAMP) is a                  
              primary conference for Mathematical Physicists and is well attended            
              by participants from around the world.  It provides a unique                   
              opportunity for not only learning about the most recent advances in            
              the field, but also for engaging in detailed discussions about                 
              significant developments and open problems in related areas with               
              the world leaders in mathematical physics.                                     
                   This travel grant will enable young American researchers to               
              attend the forthcoming IAMP Congress this summer in Leipzig,                   
              Germany.  Without funding these young scientists and graduate                  
              students would not be able to participate in this important                    
              Congress.
