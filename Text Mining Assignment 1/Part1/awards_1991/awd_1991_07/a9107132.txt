Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The performance of a vapor compression heat pump with desorber-                
              absorber heat exchange (DAHX) is being studied experimentally.                 
              This cycle is the result of further development of the two-stage               
              concept currently under investigation with NSF support.  The DAHX-             
              cycle offers surprising features, such as extremely low pressure               
              ratios and a simple layout compared to its competitors.  It is                 
              especially advantageous that the proposed cycle requires less                  
              components and heat exchange area than the two-stage version                   
              currently investigated, achieving an even larger reduction in                  
              pressure ratio.  However, as a consequence of the simplification,              
              the operating characteristics show less flexibility.                           
                                                                                             
              This two-stage version is most likely to be used in high                       
              temperature lift industrial settings.  The DAHX-cycle is useful for            
              almost any heat pumping, refrigeration and air-conditioning                    
              situation, when large temperature glides and small lifts are                   
              encountered.  A variation of the DAHX-cycle within a vapor                     
              compression system, as it is proposed here, has never been built               
              before.  It is anticipated that the study of this cycle will reveal            
              interesting features and operational experience that will allow for            
              more creative and efficient vapor compression and combined                     
              absorption/vapor compression heat pumps in the future.  The DAHX-              
              cycle is expected to be easily tailored and optimized for a given              
              application.
