Abstract    :
                   This project seeks to answer several basic questions about                
              the natural history of wild mushrooms by using classical and                   
              modern methods of genetic analysis.  The population biology and                
              genetics of the oyster mushroom will be studied, in order to                   
              understand how natural populations are established and                         
              maintained.  The unique life history of mushrooms makes it                     
              possible to carry out a variety of genetic analyses aimed at                   
              identification of wild strains and their relatives.  A primary                 
              aim of the study will be to develop and test methods for                       
              identification of population pedigrees through the use of genetic              
              markers (such as DNA fingerprinting).  The high level of                       
              resolution offered by molecular methods makes it possible to                   
              identify single strains of oyster mushrooms, as well as their                  
              immediate parents and progeny.  Oyster mushrooms are also                      
              important as a commercial food crop and source of important                    
              enzymes for breaking down plant material; the genetic markers                  
              developed for this study should also be useful for crop                        
              development and biotechnology.
