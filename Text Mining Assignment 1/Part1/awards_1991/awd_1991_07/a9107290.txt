Abstract    :
              This Research Equipment Grant (REG) provides funding for a                     
              laser-Doppler Anemometer (LDA) which well be employed to                       
              investigate a variety of thermal and fluid flow problems of                    
              interest to three different faculty and a larger number of                     
              graduate students.  Among these projects is one whose                          
              objective is to examine a particular scheme for augmentation                   
              heat transfer coefficient associated with the active cooling                   
              of integrated circuits mounted on parallel circuit boards.                     
              Two unrelated investigations involve fundamental fluid                         
              mechanics of rotating and stratified fluids.  A fourth                         
              investigation is concerned with eliminating the influence of                   
              water droplets on airborne thermometry measurements through                    
              flow field manipulation in the neighborhood of the sensor.                     
              Another study focuses on the turbulent flow field and heat                     
              transfer behavior in counter-swirled, coaxial jet mixing that                  
              models the flow in "can" type gas turbine engine combustors.                   
              A final investigation seeks to extend recent progress in                       
              understanding the influence of high rates of free stream                       
              turbulence on convective heat transfer, by extension to                        
              internal flows.
