Abstract    :
                      The Principle Investigator will determine the importance of            
              the timing of water stress on changing the susceptibility of                   
              ponderosa pine Pinus ponderosa to an outbreak prone insect                 
              herbivore, Neodiprion gillettei.  This research will test the              
              hypothesis that environmental stress predisposes forests to                    
              insect outbreaks only when stress occurs at a time within the                  
              seasonal growth of the tree that creates a disequilibrium in the               
              ecological balance between root and shoot growth.  The specific                
              hypothesis to be tested is that stress applied during the shoot                
              growth phase will increase the root:shoot ratio and decrease                   
              susceptibility to insects; while stress applied during the root                
              growth phase will decrease the root:shoot ratio and increase                   
              susceptibility to insects.                                                     
                      The proposed research will test the widely held belief that            
              stress predisposes forests to insect outbreaks.  This research                 
              will also examine the fundamental process of seasonal allocation               
              of carbon between roots and shoots and the response of herbivores              
              to differences in this allocation pattern.  These processes are                
              strongly affected by variations in climate and likely are under                
              genetic control.  Better understanding of these processes will                 
              improve the predictability of the impact of insect herbivores on               
              ponderosa pine forests under future unknown global climate                     
              conditions.
