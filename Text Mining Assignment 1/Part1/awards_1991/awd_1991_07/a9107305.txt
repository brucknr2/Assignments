Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research involves the study of the surface                                
              characteristics of a  model non-stoichiometric transition                      
              metal oxide, tungsten bronze, as a function of composition                     
              using scanning tunneling microscopy and tunneling                              
              spectroscopy  techniques. There are two objectives for the                     
              research: one is to determine the geometric and electronic                     
              structure of the surface as a function of bulk composition                     
              near the semiconductor-to-metal transition; and the other is                   
              to study the nature of the hydrocarbon absorption sites on                     
              the surfaces of these materials. From these results it will                    
              be possible to develop atomistic models to explain observed                    
              macroscopic surface phenomena. A fundamental understanding                     
              of the surface characteristics on non-stoichiometric oxides                    
              is essential for developing interfaces with appropriate                        
              adhesion properties, sensors with increased sensitivities,                     
              and catalysts with increased selectivity and efficiency.
