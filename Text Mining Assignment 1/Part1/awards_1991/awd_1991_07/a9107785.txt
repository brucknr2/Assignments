Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Invertebrates represent the largest animal biomass on earth and                
              from an economic point of view their study is of great                         
              importance.  During the past three decades there has occurred a                
              serious national decline in the quality and extent of student                  
              training in invertebrate zoology.  This decline in training has                
              resulted in several generations of undergraduate and graduate                  
              students in the biological sciences with a drastically reduced                 
              awareness of the biological diversity in which their scientific                
              work is embedded.  In conjunction, the biological research                     
              community is losing the awareness of the diversity of organisms                
              which could be developed into models systems for the solution of               
              urgent research problems.  A task group of eminent biological                  
              scientists, under the direction of Dr. Willows, will convene to                
              discuss the deteriorating state of invertebrate teaching in                    
              American universities at the undergraduate level.  This committee              
              is charged with suggesting how institutions of higher learning,                
              state and federal governments, can cooperate with the private                  
              sector to reverse this serious trend in American education.  The               
              committee's recommendations and prioritized actions could                      
              significantly enhance training opportunities in invertebrate                   
              zoology.
