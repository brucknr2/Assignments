Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research supports an economic anthropologist studying share               
              contracts in an artisanal fishing industry in the Philippines.                 
              The theoretical issues involve comparing the analysis of share-                
              cropping in farming with share-contracting in fishing.  The                    
              project will collect data on the extent to which share contracts               
              influence the acquisition of fishing technology; the extent to                 
              which the egalitarian relations of fishing crews influence the                 
              shape of share contracts; the factors accounting for crew and                  
              boat-owner choice of working relationships; the extent to which                
              interlocking relationships in credit and marketing influence the               
              ability of fishermen to negotiate with fish buyers; and the                    
              discourse between boat owners and crew members over recent                     
              changes in fishing institutions.  The methods include structured               
              sample interviews with at least 200 fishermen, and participant                 
              observation of fishing activities.                                             
                                                                                             
              This research is important because artisanal fishing is a vital                
              industry in much of the world.  By comparing the socio-economic                
              options and strategies of maritime "peasants" with agrarian                    
              peasants, a broader understanding of the way in which work                     
              process is instituted will be obtained.
