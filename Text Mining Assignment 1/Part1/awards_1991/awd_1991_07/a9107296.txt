Abstract    :
                   The goal of the proposed research is to test the role of                  
              microorganisms in mediating interactions among phytophagous                    
              insects, their host plants and their natural enemies.                          
              Specifically, the proposed research will determine how endophytic              
              fungi (fungi that produce asymptomatic infections within plant                 
              tissues)  affect colonization, dispersion, and population                      
              dynamics of leafmining and leafchewing insects that feed on a                  
              common host plant, Emory oak.  Although endophytic fungi are                   
              thought to be plant mutualists by deterring other herbivores,                  
              accumulating evidence suggests that their effects on phytophagous              
              insects are highly variable.  The proposed research will test the              
              direction and magnitude of these effects through a series of                   
              field and laboratory experiments and observations.  Ecologists                 
              have recently recognized that the pervasive effects of                         
              microorganisms such as endophytic fungi may alter conventional                 
              theories of phytophagous insect - host plant - natural enemy                   
              interactions.  By rigorously examining the effects of endophytic               
              fungi, the proposed research will test and modify these                        
              conventional theories.
