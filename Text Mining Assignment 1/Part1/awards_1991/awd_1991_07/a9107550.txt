Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research is an experimental program employing quantitative                
              transmission electron microscopy and theoretical analyses to                   
              clarify the mechanisms of precipitate nucleation and growth in                 
              model alloy systems.  The role of ternary additions in affecting               
              growth is emphasized.  Defect density, solute segregation, ledge               
              growth, and precipitate morphology and spacing are analyzed to                 
              reveal effects of systematic changes in ternary alloying additions             
              and aging treatments.  In-situ high resolution electron microscopy             
              is employed to show atomic growth mechanisms based on dislocation              
              ledges and to quantify interphase boundary motion.
