Abstract    :
              This is an equipment request to upgrade an existing                            
              Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE) Facility.  The                                    
              existing system (Varian 360, 1980 vintage) lacks                               
              many of the features that considered necessities to                            
              sustain a state of the art crystal capability.  The                            
              proposed upgrade includes computer controlled                                  
              effusion cells, a rapid pumping system, residual gas                           
              analyzer, cracking effusion cell for arsenic and high                          
              temperature cell for dopants, and new electronics                              
              for a Hall Effect system.  These improvements are                              
              necessary to maintain our continued productivity                               
              and to be sure that the graduate students are                                  
              versed in state of the art crystal growth technology.
