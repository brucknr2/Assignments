Abstract    :
                   A conference entitled 'QCD in Nuclear Physics' will be                    
              held in Tilton, NH on July 22-26, 1991.  The subject matter is                 
              central to current directions in nuclear science which will be                 
              addressed at the new national user facilities, CEBAF and RHIC,                 
              now under construction in the US.  Phenomena will be discussed                 
              which are explicitly related to quark and gluon degrees of                     
              freedom in nuclear systems, which span the interface between                   
              nuclear and elementary particle physics, and include:  color                   
              transparency, quark-gluon plasma phase transitions, EMC                        
              effect, and spin structure functions.
