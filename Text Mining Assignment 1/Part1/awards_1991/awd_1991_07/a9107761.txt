Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a joint project with Brown University to detemine                      
              the feasibility of using embedded optical fibers to obtain                     
              quantitative data on the response of concrete structures to                    
              external loads.  The data will be useful to determine the                      
              performance of the structure, and to ascertain repair and                      
              retrofit methods, if required.
