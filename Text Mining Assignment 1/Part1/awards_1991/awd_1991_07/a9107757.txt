Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              In this project, Dr. R.R. Galazka of the Institute of Physics, Polish          
              Academy of Sciences, Warsaw, will cooperate with Dr. J.K.                      
              Furdyna of the University of Notre Dame under the U.S.-Poland                  
              Marie Sklodowska-Curie Joint Fund to research "Physics and                     
              Technology of Semimagnetic Semiconductors ?SMSC!," or                          
              semiconducting alloys whose lattice is composed in part of                     
              substitutional magnetic atoms.  The researchers will focus on: (1)             
              Fe-based SMSC (sp-d exchange interaction between band electrons                
              and Fe++ in a II-VI crystal host; the position of Fe++ level with              
              respect to the band structure of the material); (2) SMSC involving             
              IV-VI hosts (band structure of the allows; the exchange interaction            
              between magnetic ions; the influence of band structure and carrier             
              concentration on magnetic properties of the materials); and (3)                
              localization phenomena in SMSC (donor and acceptor levels; the                 
              shape of the acceptor wave functions; spin-related phenomena;                  
              magnetic-field-induced semiconductor-metal Mott transition).                   
                                                                                             
              This project in condensed matter physics fulfills the program                  
              objectives of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading               
              experts in the U.S. and Poland to combine complementary efforts                
              and capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest and competence             
              on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.
