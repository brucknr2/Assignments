Abstract    :
              The PI will examine algorithm design issues in the areas of parallel           
              computation, pattern matching, coordinated robot arm motion and                
              nonlinear electrical circuit theory.  In particular:  1) the                   
              parallelization of tree-structured computations and their                      
              applications; 2) an investigation of mesh architecture with a primary          
              focus on developing methods for translating PRAM algorithms to meshes;         
              3) developing efficient algorithms for various forms of convolutions,          
              for constructing suffix trees of trees, and for pattern matching in            
              trees; 4) the development of efficient algorithms for coordinated              
              motion of robot arms; and 5) the design of polynomial-time algorithms          
              for the steady-state and transient analysis of several classes of              
              nonlinear electrical circuits.
