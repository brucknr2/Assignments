Abstract    :
                   Bootstrap is a technique which provides answers to many                   
              complex statistical questions with a minimum number of                         
              assumptions.  The investigator will to study the performance of                
              the bootstrap in cases where the observations are not independent              
              of one another.                                                                
                   The corrections needed to make the bootstrap procedure more               
              efficient for dependent processes will be studied by Edgeworth                 
              expansions.
