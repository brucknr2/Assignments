Abstract    :
              There are many variables that affect the physical and mechanical               
              properties of crystalline polymers through the processing and                  
              fabrication stages of manufacture.  Four of the most important are             
              temperature, pressure, molecular weight, and chain microstructure.             
              The long-term objective of this research is to understand the way              
              in which all four of these variables interact in determining the               
              details of the crystallization process.  Building on past work, the            
              synergistic effects of these variables will be investigated for                
              several systems.  Several recent important developments in                     
              crystallization theory will be investigated for homopolymers and               
              copolymers based principally on polyethylene, polypropylene, and               
              some semi-rigid polymers.  The research will enable quantitative               
              analysis to be made of crystallization theories.  It will help                 
              unravel the complicated synergisms of the variables referred to                
              above.  In addition it will investigate the dependence on pressure-            
              temperature of the phase transformations in polypropylene, which               
              may be of significance to the development of new processing                    
              methods.  Much of the basic aspects of the research will involve               
              experimental and theoretical approaches to this essential, but                 
              relatively unexplored, feature of crystallization.
