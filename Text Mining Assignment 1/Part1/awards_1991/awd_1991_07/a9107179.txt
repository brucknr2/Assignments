Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The aim of this proposal is to demonstrate that the best                       
              opportunity for directing the crystallization process toward                   
              desired phases and morphology may be during the crystal growth                 
              process by controlling nucleation and directing the formation of               
              preferred mesoscopic prenucleation aggregates.  It will be shown               
              that the growth and morphology of molecular crystals on substrates             
              can be directed by (1) using surfaces with monolayers that provide             
              uniform wetting properties and controlled nucleation, and (2) by               
              promoting self-assembly interactions at surfaces derivatized with              
              carefully designed functionalized monolayers.                                  
                                                                                             
              This award is part of the "Materials Chemistry and Chemical                    
              Processing Initiative," and it is jointly funded by the Division of
