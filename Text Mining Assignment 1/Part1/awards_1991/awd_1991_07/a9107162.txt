Abstract    :
                   The quantum mechanics of spatially homogenous                             
              cosmological models is important both as a paradigm for                        
              quantum gravity and as an arena for the study of quantum                       
              effects in the Early Universe.  The wave function of the                       
              Universe may be obtained either as the solution to the                         
              Wheeler-DeWitt equation or from a path integral formulation.                   
              For more than two or three degrees of freedom, neither                         
              analytic nor numerical differencing methods can be used.  Dr.                  
              Berger will apply several numerical simulation methods which                   
              yield wave functions in many contexts (e.g. for multi-electron                 
              atoms, condensed matter, and dissolved electron in fluid                       
              systems with an arbitrary number of degrees of freedom) to                     
              quantized cosmological models.                                                 
                   The physical behavior of the simulations will be examined                 
              particularly with regard to the presence of inflation,                         
              fluctuations, and singularity avoidance.  Formal issues will                   
              be pursued with a lattice simulation of quantum gravity as the                 
              eventual goal.
