Abstract    :
                   Over the past ten years, mathematical models of infectious                
              disease have elucidated the impact of natural selection upon                   
              pathogen virulence.  Specifically, whether natural selection will              
              lead to higher or lower virulence is thought to depend upon the                
              effect of virulence upon disease transmissibility.  The                        
              investigators propose to test this hypothesis by using two clones              
              of the nuclear polythedrosis virus of gypsy moth, Lymantria                    
              dispar; these clones are of very different virulence and can be                
              identified from field samples on the basis of restriction                      
              endonuclease maps.  A combination of laboratory measurements and               
              small-scale field experiments will be used to estimate different               
              aspects of the transmissibility of the two clones.  These                      
              estimates will be used to predict which clone will predominate in              
              the field.  This prediction will be tested by seeding 1 hectare                
              plots with disinfected gypsy moth eggs, and simultaneously                     
              introducing both clones of the virus.  Competitive superiority                 
              will be indicated by which clone infects more larvae over the                  
              course of an epizootic.                                                        
                   Assumptions about the evolution of pathogen virulence have                
              influenced research on disease ecology for decades, but have been              
              largely untested.  The work that is proposed here will greatly                 
              reduce the gap between theory and reality in the study of the                  
              evolutionary ecology of disease.
