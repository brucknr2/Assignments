Abstract    :
                   This award will allow the PI to identify, conserve and                    
              curate the type specimens (604+) in the Mycological Herbarium of               
              Pennsylvania State University (67,500 specimens, including 565                 
              types).  The conservation procedure involves placing the                       
              specimens in air-tight plastic bags and storing in acid-free                   
              packets and genus-folders.  Curation will involve capturing all                
              of the relevant data attendant to the type material on a                       
              computerized database, so that it can be shared over networks                  
              with scientists at other institutions who are involved in                      
              mycological research.  This project will contribute to scientific              
              research and education (graduate students) on fungi.
