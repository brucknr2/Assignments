Abstract    :
              Biologists categorize life on the basis of characters that                     
              organisms share.  For most of the history of biology, morphology               
              has been the prime source of characters for biologists to                      
              accomplish this important task.  Often times, certain morphologies             
              of organisms can look alike because of convergence, and this                   
              convergence can confuse and mislead classification systems if not              
              properly treated.  This proposal will attempt to examine the                   
              developmental basis of some of these confusing convergent                      
              characters in flies.  In particular, this project will examine the             
              molecular events involved in the development of the head of some               
              very bizarre Drosophila species, in the hope that the basis of                 
              convergence can be discovered.  The research planned for this                  
              project will also be directly applicable to our understanding of               
              the developmental process in general.
