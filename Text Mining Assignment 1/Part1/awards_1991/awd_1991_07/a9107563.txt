Abstract    :
              Computational simulations and research will be conducted on                    
              strongly correlated electronic systems.  Examples of these systems             
              include high temperature superconductors, heavy Fermion materials              
              and magnetic materials.  Quantum Monte Carlo techniques will be                
              combined with methods of statistical inference to allow us to                  
              simulate the dynamical response of these systems.  In addition,                
              methods which combine quantum Monte Carlo and analytical techniques            
              will be employed.  One objective of the research is to calculate               
              experimentally and theoretically relevant properties of model                  
              systems more accurately than heretofore possible.  Another                     
              objective is to explore the non-perturbative regions of these                  
              models in order to predict new physical phenomena.

              Strongly correlated many-body systems such as high temperature                 
              superconductors and magnetic metals are not amenable to the usual              
              theoretical techniques such as perturbation theory.  Consequently,             
              because of the absence of analytical methods computational                     
              simulations become increasingly important to understand the physics            
              involved with these systems.  This grant will conduct simulations              
              using a variety of techniques in order to assess the techniques and            
              to gain insight into the underlying physics for sample strongly                
              correlated systems.
