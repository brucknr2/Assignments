Abstract    :
                   This project will investigate the chemical and sensory                    
              foundations of host specificity in herbivorous insects.                        
              Differences in the ability of closely related insect species to                
              use a plant host, and discrepancies between responses of adults                
              and larvae of the same species will be examined.  Two cabbage                  
              butterflies, Pieris rapae and P.napi oleracea (Lepidoptera) and                
              five differentially utilized crucifers will serve as a model                   
              system.  The major objectives are (1) to determine how behavioral              
              and sensory responses differ between life stages and between                   
              species, and (2) to determine the extent to which chemical                     
              differences between plants account for their susceptibility to                 
              pierid herbivory.  Different bioassays will guide the isolation                
              of plant compounds affecting oviposition, feeding and growth of                
              the insects.  Electrophysiological recordings  will be used to                 
              compare sensory and behavioral responses to the compounds.  The                
              results will provide an integrated view of the way that                        
              interactions between plant chemistry and insect responses at                   
              different life stages lead to insect-hostplant specificity.
