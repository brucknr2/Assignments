Abstract    :
                      The amount of variability which is expressed and available             
              for selection to act upon may depend on the environment.  This                 
              study will use a common annual plant, pals jewelweed (Impatiens              
              pallida), to test the effect of the environment on the expression            
              of genetic variance and the intensity of natural selection.                    
              Populations of jewelweed from hillside and  floodplain                         
              environments will be reciprocally transplanted, allowing                       
              quantification of effect of the environment on selection and                   
              genetic variability.  Populations exposed to 'alien' (vis.a.vis,               
              'home') environments may express larger amount of genetic                      
              variability as well as greater selection, thus allowing more                   
              rapid evolution.  On the other hand, if populations are unable to              
              adapt to a new environment, they are more likely to become                     
              extinct.  Being able to predict the evolutionary response of                   
              populations is particularly crucial now as species are facing                  
              rapid environmental changes at the global and regional level.
