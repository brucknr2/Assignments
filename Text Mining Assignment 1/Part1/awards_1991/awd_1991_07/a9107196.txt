Abstract    :
                   This project concerns the asymptotic solution of nonlinear                
              boundary value problems whose solutions involve boundary and                   
              interior layer regions of rapid change.  Extensive numerical                   
              computation must be carried out to solve these problems for                    
              specific values.  Also, involved in the solution is symbolic                   
              computation for both regular perturbation problems and for carrying            
              out Poincare-Lindstedt type procedures.  Symbolic computation                  
              promises new techniques and methods for these problems.                        
                   This project is in the general area of applied mathematics                
              and, more specifically, in the area of singular perturbations.  Of             
              special note in this project will be the use of symbolic                       
              computation for boundary layer and shock problems.  This research              
              has wide applications to engineering.
