Abstract    :
                   The objective of this research is to study the various                    
              energy exchange processes occurring between the magnetosphere and              
              low/mid latitude thermosphere during magnetic storms.  The study               
              entails the measurement and interpretation of optical  emissions               
              produced by the precipitation of ring current particles into the               
              low/mid latitude thermosphere.  It is proposed to continue                     
              ground-based optical observations at McDonald Observatory in                   
              southwest Texas using a set of existing photometers and                        
              spectrometers.  Physical processes to be studied from such                     
              observations include the precipitation of energetic neutrals,                  
              ions, and soft electron fluxes, the effects of ionospheric                     
              heating, ionization, and excitation from such fluxes, and the                  
              distribution of ring current particles and the ionospheric                     
              current systems associated with the precipitation.
