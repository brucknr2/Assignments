Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research project consists of four interrelated project areas              
              utilizing field manipulations and laboratory experiments designed              
              to elucidate several features of epipelic periphyton function in               
              lake ecosystems.  Specific objectives are 1) to determine how                  
              widespread are diel fluctuations in phosphorus efflux rates from               
              sediments among different lake types, 2) to further define the                 
              mechanism(s) controlling diel variation in phosphorus efflux 3)                
              to quantify the effects of hydrodynamics and epipelic algal                    
              photosynthesis on seasonal oxygen dynamics of lake hypolimnia,                 
              and 4) to quantify the relative contributions of epipelic                      
              periphyton production and seston sedimentation to annual sediment              
              accretion.  The mechanistic approach to examining these process-               
              level questions will rely on extensive use of oxygen and pH                    
              sensitive microelectrodes in both field and laboratory, and on                 
              radiotracers for laboratory studies of biogeochemical processes                
              affected by the metabolic activity of periphyton.  The research                
              will be based at The University of Notre Dame Environmental                    
              Research Center in northern Wisconsin.
