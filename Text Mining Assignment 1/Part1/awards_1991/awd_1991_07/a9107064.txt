Abstract    :
                   A user mode research program will be carried out in                       
              nuclear structure using charge exchange reactions, in                          
              electromagnetic structure of the nucleon, and in heavy ion                     
              reactions aimed at determination of the equation of state of                   
              nuclear matter.  These activities will be carried out at the                   
              Indiana University Cyclotron Facility, at the MIT/Bates and                    
              CEBAF electron accelerators, and at the Lawrence Berkeley                      
              Laboratory Bevalac.  A common theme of the Kent State group                    
              activities is application of neutron detection techniques to                   
              nucleon and nuclear structure studies of significant current                   
              interest.  New types of neutron detectors and polarimeters                     
              will be developed.
