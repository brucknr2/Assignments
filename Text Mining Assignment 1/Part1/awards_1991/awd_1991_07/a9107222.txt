Abstract    :
                   One part of the study investigates the aerodynamic                        
              characteristics of the separated feathers that form slots at the               
              wing tips of birds that soar over land.  Theoretically, these                  
              feathers could reduce air resistance (drag).  Similar structures               
              (winglets) on the wing tips of some modern aircraft have this                  
              effect.  The study will measure how much the tip feathers reduce               
              drag in living birds and model bird wings in a wind tunnel.  The               
              results will answer a long-standing question about the role of                 
              the tip feathers in birds and will provide data that can be                    
              compared with measurements on aircraft winglets.                               
                   A second part of the study investigates the drag of wingless              
              birds in a wind tunnel.  Body drag must be known in order to                   
              evaluate theories for both gliding and flapping flight.  These                 
              theories explain how birds fly, and they are used to calculate                 
              food requirements during both daily foraging and long migratory                
              flights.  The amount of food that an environment can supply is a               
              factor that must be considered in any plan to maintain or restore              
              bird populations.
