Abstract    :
              It is proposed to conduct the first detailed experimental study of             
              inhomogeneous superfluid turbulence.  Present theory gives an                  
              excellent description of experimental observations in circumstances            
              where the turbulence is known to be homogeneous.  Preliminary                  
              results indicate that the effects of non-uniformity can be large               
              and it is important that these be understood.
