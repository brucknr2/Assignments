Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The primary objective of this US-Hungary Joint Fund                            
              research project between Zsolt Bor, JAIF University, and                       
              Walter E. Bron, University of California, Irvine, is to                        
              investigate methods for increasing the wavelength coverage                     
              of a laser system.  Methods will include a modified                            
              version of a recently developed coupled-cavity mode                            
              locking, the use of the traveling wave excited amplified                       
              spontaneous emission as wide-spectrum probe light, and new                     
              frequency conversion schemes for ultrashort pulses.                            
                                                                                             
              This project in the field of laser physics fulfills the                        
              program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by                         
              enabling leading experts in the United States and Eastern                      
              Europe to combine complementary talents and pool research                      
              resources in areas of strong mutual interest and                               
              competence.
