Abstract    :
              The objective of this award is to test the feasibility of the use              
              of scintillant coupled to biotinylated antibodies, radioactive                 
              macromolecular precursors and conventional electron microscope                 
              autoradiography for the detection of newly-synthesized                         
              macromolecules.  The method, if developed, will allow researchers              
              to follow the dynamics of specific molecules from their site of                
              synthesis to their destination within the cell.  The feasibility               
              test will be carried out on: (1) localization of rubisco in                    
              chloroplasts of Lemna, (2) localization of catalase in                         
              peroxisomes, and (3) localization and tracking of vacuolar ATPase              
              in plant root tips.
