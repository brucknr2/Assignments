Abstract    :
                   This award supports the research of Professor M. Cordero-                 
              Vourtsanis to work in combinatorics.  She intends to study a class             
              of finite affine planes coordinatized by nonassociative algebras.              
              She intends to classify finite translation planes of rank 3 and odd            
              dimension over their kernel, those with specialized orbits in the              
              line at infinity, and a class that admits a p-primitive Baer                   
              collineation.                                                                  
                   This research is in the general area of combinatorics.                    
              Combinatorics attempts to find efficient methods to study how                  
              discrete collections of objects can be organized.  And, so it is               
              extremely important to modern communications, for example the                  
              design of large networks as in telephone systems and the design of             
              algorithms in computer science.
