Abstract    :
                   This action will provide continued support for an active                  
              group of two senior investigators and students for experiments                 
              on the scattering of high energy muons from nuclei.  The data                  
              is collected at Fermilab's Tevatron accelerator.  Fermilab                     
              experiment E665, "Deep Inelastic Muon Scattering with Hadron                   
              Detection" was first exposed to the muon beam in the summer of                 
              1985.  In March of 1990 the experiment was prepared to begin                   
              its final run.  To date, scattering studies have been                          
              completed with heavy nuclear targets.  By January 1992, the                    
              scattering data from hydrogen and deuterium should be complete                 
              and the final analysis begun.  These experiments probe the                     
              structure of nuclear matter and the formation processes for                    
              strongly interacting particles.  It is closely related to the                  
              scattering of neutrinos by nuclear matter and electron proton                  
              collisions, also supported by the National Science Foundation.                 
                   In the out years of the grant period, other activities                    
              will be started including instrumentation development for the                  
              Superconducting Super Collider.
