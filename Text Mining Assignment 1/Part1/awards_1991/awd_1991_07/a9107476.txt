Abstract    :
                   In this project the principal investigators will work                     
              separately and jointly on a number of interesting problems in                  
              Fourier Analysis.  Among the specific topics to be considered are              
              the following:  rearrangements of orthogonal systems of                        
              functions, the metrical properties of Besicovitch sets in higher               
              dimensions and their relationship to the Bochner-Riesz                         
              summability of Fourier series, and the distributional properties               
              of Dirichlet sums.  Each of these topics has a long and venerable              
              history in classical analysis, and the principal investigators                 
              are in the forefront of mathematicians working on improving our                
              understanding of Fourier series.                                               
                   Fourier series arise in a host of pure and applied contexts,              
              and it is not an exaggeration to say that their study has                      
              provided much of the motivation for twentieth-century analysis.                
              The principal investigators in this project are two of the                     
              greatest analysts in the world today, and they propose to study                
              some challenging questions regarding the properties of Fourier                 
              series and the functions defined by them.
