Abstract    :
              Cohoon         This research takes an integrated look across the physical 
              design activities of partitioning, floorplanning and routing.   The work has
              two components, routing and partitioning.  In  routing, algorithms for
              generalized multi-layer and multi-net  routing are being explored.  These
              algorithms are designed to  route on any number of layers, work on a
              rectilinear, gridless  surface with obstacles, account for technology
              constraints, and  permit horizontal, vertical and 45 degree wiring on a layer. 
              In  partitioning, a powerful geometric partitioning technique called  SHARP is
              being used to develop algorithms (including parallel  ones) which bridge
              between various physical design activities,  such as floor-planning, Steiner
              routing, and identification of  critical nets.  Algorithms are being integrated
              into a tool for  overall design, and a visualization tool is being developed.
