Abstract    :
              This is a request to purchase a                                                
              System 7000 video-based imaging                                                
              instrument.  This head mounted                                                 
              instrument is used to measure the                                              
              movement of both eyes                                                          
              noninvasively.  The instrument will                                            
              be used to characterize eye

              and to determine whether eye                                                   
              movements might be used as a

              individuals.  The project may                                                  
              provide a new technological tool                                               
              for interacting with severely
