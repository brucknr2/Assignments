Abstract    :
              Thermoluminescence dating (TL) is a technique that holds out                   
              great promise for archaeology in the age determination of                      
              inorganic materials, especially in the period beyond 50,000 years              
              ago.  Unfortunately, many complications in the use of the                      
              technique remain to be resolved before it can be used routinely                
              and with precision.                                                            
                                                                                             
              Drs. Hornyak and Franklin will continue their program of                       
              experimental work aimed at development and testing of a reliable               
              technique for dating quartz-bearing sediments without uncertainty              
              as to the level of zeroing of the TL signal.  Control samples of               
              relatively recent material, well dated by radiocarbon methods,                 
              will be dated by TL as a control.                                              
                                                                                             
              The further development of TL dating is of extreme importance and              
              the PI's are among the world leaders in this area of research.
