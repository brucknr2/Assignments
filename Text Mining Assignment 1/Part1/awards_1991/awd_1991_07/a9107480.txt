Abstract    :
              Leguminosae is the third largest family of flowering plants, and               
              includes many ecologically and economically important species.  To             
              understand this great divesity it is necessary to describe the                 
              patterns of relationship and phylogeny linking the many species and            
              genera to one another.  Much work of this type has been done, and              
              continues, using traditional characters such as morphology and                 
              chemistry.   This study will focus on variation patterns at the DNA            
              level, specifically emphasizing the chloroplast genome, which has              
              proven to be of great utility as a source of characters for                    
              constructing phylogenetic hypotheses.  Restriction site analysis               
              and DNA sequencing will be used to survey genera representing all              
              of the major tribes of the pivotal subfamilies Papilionoideae and              
              Caesalpinioideae, the groups considered to represent the main                  
              radiation of the family.  Results from these studies will be                   
              integrated with those of non-molecular studies progressing                     
              elsewhere in the community.  The resulting phylogenetic hypotheses             
              will be used to study the origins of nitrogen-fixing symbioses in              
              the family, with emphasis on the development of the nuclear                    
              multigene families involved in nodulation.
