Abstract    :
              The research objective is to isolate the factors that control the              
              self-assembly of amphiphilic polymers and surfactants.  In solution            
              these molecules aggregate into clusters that alter the macroscopic             
              rheological and phase behavior of the host fluid.  In order to                 
              relate microstructure to macroscopic properties, the factors that              
              control the structure of polymer-surfactant complexes must be                  
              determined.  Monte Carlo and analytic techniques will be used to               
              systematically vary the polymer and surfactant concentration,                  
              architecture and interaction energies and, thus, to determine the              
              size and shape of the resulting clusters.  Scaling laws will then              
              be developed to relate the size of these clusters to the length and            
              number of chains in the aggregate.  The scaling laws will be used              
              to relate the microstructure and growth of the cluster to the                  
              macroscopic viscosity.  Statistical models will be developed to                
              determine the phase behavior of the polymer/surfactant/solvent                 
              mixture.                                                                       
              %%%                                                                            
              The self-assembly of amphiphilic polymers and surfactants in                   
              solution is of intrinsic scientific interest and also has many                 
              applications.  These molecules form comb-like structures and are               
              difficult to model.  This work will be one of the first attempts to            
              fully describe these systems.  Understanding of these novel                    
              materials will assist in the design of macromolecular solutions                
              with prescribed properties.  The results of this study will assist             
              in the development of materials that are useful for applications in            
              controlled drug release, viscosity modification, enhanced oil                  
              recovery and separation processes.
