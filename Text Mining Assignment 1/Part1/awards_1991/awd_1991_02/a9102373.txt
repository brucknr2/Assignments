Abstract    :
                   This proposal is for continuation of thermospheric tidal                  
              studies being conducted with NCAR Thermosphere/Ionosphere General              
              Circular Model.  This work directly addresses two goals of the                 
              NSF CEDAR program; detailed understanding of the low thermosphere              
              global dynamics and mesosphere/thermosphere coupling.                          
                   There have been advances in tidal studies.  Key developments              
              are; 1) the parameterization of the waves excited in the lower                 
              atmosphere in the thermosphere models to better represent the                  
              coupling between the lower and upper atmosphere; 2) the inclusion              
              of both the upward propagating  diurnal and semidiurnal waves in               
              the thermospheric models; 3) the self-consistent                               
              ionosphere/thermosphere coupling in models; 4) the availability                
              of simulation of simultaneous observations of thermospheric winds              
              and temperatures for the first time from loe, mid and high                     
              latitude stations.  Such data sets are invaluable for testing                  
              theoretical tidal models.                                                      
                   The research proposed has two main emphasis: 1) the                       
              provision of model simulations in support of campaigns; and 2)                 
              the continuation of theoretical tidal studies.  The main topics                
              of interest for the latter are: monthly simulations of the                     
              thermospheric tides during the solar cycles minimum and maximum;               
              the effects of geomagnetic activity on the thermosphere,                       
              including the zonal mean/tide/gravity wave interaction; the                    
              effects of diurnal tides on the thermosphere/ionosphere; and the               
              latitude atmosphere/ionosphere.  Investigation may be extended to              
              the vertical velocities, the terdiurnal and quatradiurnal tides,               
              the midnight temperatures anomaly, and the possible derivation of              
              tidal information from the descent of sporadic E and F1 layer.
