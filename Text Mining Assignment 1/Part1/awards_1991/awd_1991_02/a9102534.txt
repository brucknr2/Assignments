Abstract    :
                   The research addresses two classes of problems for                        
              reconfiguring the interconnection architecture for a multiprocessor            
              computer system to insure its continued performance, possibly in a             
              degraded mode after the failures of some parts of the system.  Two             
              somewhat distinct aspects of this problem are studied:                         
                   1) Automatic identification of faulty units (processors) in               
              such systems have been extensively studied by this investigator and            
              others, including the design of a fully distributed algorithm for              
              this purpose.  The investigator will use distributed gossiping in              
              a faulty environment to design an algorithm for the identification             
              of faulty units.  The algorithm is fully distributed and far more              
              efficient than existing algorithms.                                            
                   2) There are multiprocessor systems which require a particular            
              interconnection architecture (network) for their continued                     
              performance.  The researcher intends to study further the ways in              
              which some redundancies in the network can be introduced so that a             
              desired interconnection architecture is preserved even if certain              
              numbers of units fail.
