Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Measurements of tritium and 3He will opportunely be taken on a                 
              previously funded cruise to study the formation and spreading of               
              Subarctic Intermediate Water (SAIW).  These tracers will allow                 
              the processes of formation and sinking of this water mass to be                
              examined on short time scales (weeks to months) and provide                    
              complementary data to that already proposed.
