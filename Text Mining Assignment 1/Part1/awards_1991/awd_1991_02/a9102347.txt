Abstract    :
              This project proposes to take immediate advantage of a                         
              unique opportunity to obtain valuable full-scale test                          
              data on the seismic performance of existing multi-story                        
              building frames with masonry infill walls in the City of                       
              Los Angeles.  Four older, existing buildings constructed                       
              between 1913 and 1917 are scheduled for demolition in                          
              downtown Los Angeles in late December.  This group of                          
              buildings consists of: one 12-story building, two 4-story                      
              buildings, and one 7-story building, all with infill                           
              masonry infill walls.  These building types are                                
              representative of the many hundreds, if not thousands, of                      
              similar buildings that exist in seismic regions in the                         
              U.S.                                                                           
                                                                                             
              The P.I. has been given permission by the building owners                      
              and local officials to test these buildings before they                        
              are demolished by using testing procedures on the                              
              building components and subassemblies that will provide                        
              invaluable information on their seismic load/deformation                       
              characteristics.  The City of Los Angeles is involved as                       
              a major coordinator in this project and is contributing                        
              donated time for participation by one of its officials.                        
              As the buildings will be demolished by late December,                          
              time is of the essence in obtaining this perishable data.                      
                                                                                             
              The research plan encompasses a testing program that                           
              includes:                                                                      
                                                                                             
                   1.   Out of plane testing of infill walls.                                
                   2.   In plane testing of infill walls and material                        
                        properties.                                                          
                   3.   Concrete and steel frame construction details.                       
                   4.   Concrete encased steel frame beam/colum                              
                        connections.                                                         
                   5.   Full scale building harmonic shaker vibration.                       
                                                                                             
              One major objective of this research is to document the                        
              steel rebar steel types/taps, etc., and the types of                           
              connections in the steel frames.  In addition, material                        
              strengths will be measured in order to develop specific                        
              numbers for the performance of similar existing building                       
              classes and construction types of the same age.  Another                       
              major objective will be placed on the use of                                   
              nondestructive testing instruments that is in current                          
              application by structural engineers in the Los Angeles                         
              region to determine the location of rebars.                                    
                                                                                             
              This project is expected to produce valuable results for                       
              the advancement of earthquake engineering research in the                      
              investigation of the older, existing building problem.
