Abstract    :
                   Data in diverse fields such as hydrology,geophysics and                   
              economics often display long range dependence.  Efficient                      
              adaptive estimators for the model parameters of such processes                 
              will be developed.                                                             
                   Bilinear time series models arise in economics, meteorology,              
              oceanography, and seismology along with several other areas.                   
              Optimal inferential procedures for these important classes of                  
              models will also be developed.
