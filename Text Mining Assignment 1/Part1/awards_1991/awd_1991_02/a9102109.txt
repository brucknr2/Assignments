Abstract    :
                   Professor Ruan will continue his work on operator spaces and              
              operator algebras.  This work will include investigations in (i)               
              the theory of operator spaces in connection with the theory of                 
              Banach spaces, (ii) the intrinsic relations between the coactions              
              of locally compact groups G and the completely contractive A(G)-               
              module actions on von Neumann algebras and C*-algebras, (iii)                  
              subdiagonal algebras of groupoid C*-algebras, (iv) the abstract                
              matrix norm characterization of dual operator algebras.                        
                    The notion of a C* algebra is an abstraction of the idea of              
              a family of linear transformations on a space.  These                          
              transformations can also be thought of as having values in the                 
              states of the space, and the property of this family which is                  
              responsible for the symbol * is that the algebra is generated by               
              transformations whose values in these states are real numbers.  The            
              fact that these objects appear naturally in many branches of                   
              mathematics and physics make them important to study.
