Abstract    :
              This project will conduct two ocean-bottom seismometer tomography              
              experiments in conjunction with an already funded two-ship mucti-              
              channel seismic experiment on the East Pacific Rise south of the               
              Garrett fracture zone.  The ocean-bottom seismometer deployment in             
              the first area will be used to constrain the cross-axis structure              
              including the axial low-velocity zone and the pattern of upper                 
              crustal velocity variation.  The second deployment will determine              
              the continuity of the axial low-velocity zone across the                       
              overlapping spreading center at 15.9 degrees south.
