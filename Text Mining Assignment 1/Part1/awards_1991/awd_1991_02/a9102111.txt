Abstract    :
                   This project will investigate Floquet exponents, Floquet                  
              expansions, and related properties of solutions to elliptic and                
              parabolic equations with periodic coefficients.  Emphasis will be              
              placed on the understanding of the geometry of the set of Floquet              
              exponents, expansion of solutions in terms of Floquet solutions,               
              and the connections between the geometry of the Floquet exponents              
              and the properties of the given equation.                                      
                   These studies have been motivated by problems arising in areas            
              of mathematical physics such as stability theory, quantum theory of            
              solids, hydrodynamics, and inverse scattering theory.
