Abstract    :
              Long- & Medium-Term Research: Detecting Mixing Effects in the                  
              Luminol Chemical Oscillator with CARS                                          
                                                                                             
              This award is made under the Program for Long- & Medium-Term                   
              Research at Foreign Centers of Excellence, which enables U.S.                  
              scientists and engineers to conduct three to twelve months                     
              abroad at research centers of proven excellence.  The                          
              program's awards provide opportunities for joint research,                     
              and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise                   
              and experimental conditions abroad.                                            
                                                                                             
              This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research                   
              visit by Christopher John Doona of Brandeis University with                    
              Dr. Friedeman W. Schneider of the Institut fur Physikalische                   
              Chemie der Universitat Wurzburg, Germany.  The researchers                     
              will examine the luminol oscillator for the effects of                         
              imperfect mixing with Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Spectroscopy                  
              (CARS).  The crossed laser system used in CARS enables small,                  
              discrete regions within a reactor to be examined independently.                
              A complete mapping of the mixing profile in the reactor thus                   
              can be determined.  Mapping mixing with CARS in a nonreactive                  
              system is done only at Wurzburg.  This proposal will extend                    
              this technique to the reactive luminol system, and will be                     
              helpful in understanding mixing effects in other systems and                   
              in the modelling of exotic dynamic behavior such as chaos.                     
                                                                                             
              The award recommendation provides funds to cover international                 
              travel and a flat administrative allowance of $250 for the                     
              U.S. home institution.
