Abstract    :
              Macaulay is a specialized computer algebra system for computing in             
              algebraic geometry and commutative algebra.  It is also useful in              
              other fields, such as combinatorics, knot theory, splines and                  
              differential equations.  Currently, Macaulay is used by a large number         
              of users, mostly researches in algebraic geometry and commutative              
              algebra.  In order to make Macaulay available to a larger community,           
              the mechanism for updating and distributing Macaulay will be improved.         
              The Macaulay documentation will be improved and a tutorial will be             
              added to aid users in learning simple as well as more advanced                 
              features of the system.
