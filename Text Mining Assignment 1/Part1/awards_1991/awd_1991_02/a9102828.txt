Abstract    :
              Continuous sections of uppermost ocean crust produced at the East              
              Pacific Rise, including the pillow-sheeted dike and dike-gabbro                
              transitions, have been exposed by rifting in the Hess Deep were                
              explored and sampled during 11 dives of ALVIN in 1990.  Over 200               
              rock samples recovered in 9 dredge hauls.  The preliminary studies             
              will be extended by obtaining a comprehensive suite of major-oxide,            
              trace-element, and mineral data using the new ICP-MS at Scripps
