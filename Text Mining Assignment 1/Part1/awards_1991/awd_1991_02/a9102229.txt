Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The historic explosive eruptions of Krakatau (1883) and                        
              tambora(1815) volcanoes in Indonesia discharged over 40 km 3 of                
              pyroclastic material into the sea, mostly as voluminous gravity                
              flows.  With previous funding samples have been obtained of the                
              submarine deposits areound Krakatau volcano by a diver.deployed                
              coring system.  The study focussed on the origin of two ephmeral               
              islands, Steers and Calmeyer, that formed to the nortwest of                   
              Krakatau as a result of the catastrophic 1883 eruption.                        
              Underwater geologic mapping and preliminary examination of                     
              sediment cores indicate that the two islands were formed by the                
              entrance of subaerially.generated pyroclastic flows into the sea.              
                                                                                             
              The findings have shed new light on the controversy surrounding                
              the origing of devstating tsunamis associated with the eruption                
              and the fate of Krakatau island during the paroxymal stage of the              
              event. New funds for as additional will be used to carry                       
              outstudies on the samples collected in 1990  and existing samples              
              of the tambora 1815 deposits.  Thermal demagnetization studies on              
              pumice and lithic clasts from the subaqueous pyroclastic flow                  
              deposits will be made to determine emplacement temperatures and                
              investigate the role of seawater as colling agent during                       
              subaqueous transport and deposition. Detailed grain size,                      
              component abundance, and image analysis will also be carried out               
              to evaluate the nature of hot, pyroclastic flow interactions with              
              seawater.  These result will be significant in terms of                        
              understanding the eruptive processes of these event sand                       
              providing modern analogues of volcaniclastic sedimentation that                
              can be applied to ancient convergent margin sequences in the                   
              geologic record.
