Abstract    :
                   This research involves the following principle: imposing large            
              loading on asymmetric systems results in highly oscillatory behavior.          
              The greater the asymmetry, the larger the number of oscillatory                
              solutions.  This research applies this principle in one form or another        
              to nonlinear boundary value problems of elliptic, hyperbolic, and              
              parabolic type as well as with ordinary differential equations and             
              Hamiltonian systems.  In the periodic case, there is a considerable body       
              of information which suggests that some of these solutions are                 
              asymptotically stable and commonly occurring.  This work has led to new        
              insights into nonlinear periodic oscillations in suspended masses, rods        
              and beams, and in floating beams.                                              
                   This research is in the general area of applied mathematics.  The         
              project involves a mixture of analytic theory, functional analysis,            
              numerical and computational analysis, and an extension of these results        
              to concrete engineering problems such as the structure of bridges and          
              ships.
