Abstract    :
                   This grant supports the research of Professor B. Smith to work            
              on general Tauberian theorems and their applications to number                 
              theory.  In particular, he wishes to develop a Tauberian theorem               
              that would be applicable to the estimation of integrals that arise             
              in the twin prime conjecture.                                                  
                   The field of analytic number theory applies to the discrete               
              realm of the whole numbers the techniques of analysis.  These                  
              techniques, dependent on the notions of continuity and limit,                  
              originated with the calculus.  The idea of using continuous methods            
              to investigate the discrete is two centuries old, but with the work            
              of the modern analytic number theorists, the field has had a new               
              rebirth.
