Abstract    :
                   This award supports the research of Professor J. Kollar to                
              work in algebraic geometry.  He will work on the geometric approach            
              to minimal models in dimension three.  The research is primarily               
              concerned with finding minimal models for singular threefolds in               
              all characteristics.                                                           
                   The research is in the field of algebraic geometry, one of the            
              oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which blossomed to the             
              point where it has, in the past 10 years, solved problems that have            
              stood for centuries.  Originally, it treated figures defined in the            
              plane by the simplest of equations, namely polynomials.  Today, the            
              field uses methods not only from algebra, but also from analysis               
              and topology, and conversely it is extensively used in those                   
              fields.  Moreover, it has proved itself useful in fields as diverse            
              as physics, theoretical computer science, cryptography, coding                 
              theory and robotics.
