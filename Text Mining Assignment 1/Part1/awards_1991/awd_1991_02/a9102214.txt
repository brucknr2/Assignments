Abstract    :
              This award from the U.S.-Brazil Cooperative Science                            
              Program supports research in chemistry to be conducted                         
              by Dr. Laurence S. Romsted of Rutgers University, Dr.                          
              Clifford A. Bunton of the University of California,                            
              Santa Barbara, Dr. Hernan Chaimovich of the University                         
              of Sao Paulo, Brazil, and Dr. Faruk Nome of the Federal                        
              University of Santa Catarina, Brazil.  The project will                        
              provide new information on the interactions of ions and                        
              molecules at association colloid surfaces.                                     
                                                                                             
              The project will enable the continuation of a successful                       
              collaborative effort between the four groups and will                          
              continue to test, refine and develop models for treating                       
              reactivity in association colloids such as micelles,                           
              microemulsions and vesicles.  New methods for estimating                       
              surface concentrations of species in micelles and                              
              vesicles; quantitative modeling of specific ion binding                        
              effects on micelles; and the modeling of ion binding on                        
              the interior of sonicated vesicles are among the                               
              immediate goals of the project.
