Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A combination of laboratory and numerical modeling will be used to             
              document how the ridge-trench collision disrupts the forearc at the            
              Chile triple junction and how a new forearc is built after the                 
              ridge has passed.  This will involve three major areas of                      
              investigation:  1) determine mechanical properties and downhole-               
              measurable conditions implied by mechanical models for deforming               
              forearcs; 2) use scale and numerical modeling to study the                     
              relationship between forearc basins and the overall mechanics of               
              the forearc; 3) model the passage of an obstruction such as a ridge            
              to explain such a feature can have a profound effect on a margin.
