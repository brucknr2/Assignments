Abstract    :
              The structure, function and evolutionary relationship of various               
              RNA and DNA plant and animal viruses are to be studied by use of               
              X-ray diffraction methods.  Recently, Dr. Rossmann solved the first            
              structure of a single-stranded DNA virus (canine parvovirus).  He              
              now wishes to exploit this structure to investigate such functions             
              as, for instance, the canyon-like depression on its surface (is it             
              the site of receptor attachment?), the spikes on the threefold axes            
              (is this the site where neutralizing antibodies attach?), the                  
              fivefold cylindrical structure (is this required for transport of              
              the virus to the cell nucleus) or the structure of part of the                 
              ssDNA bound to the capsid proteins (does the viral coat protein                
              recognize a specific DNA sequence?)                                            
                                                                                             
              Dr. Rossmann is also studying the ssDNA bacterial virus X174 and               
              other structure such as those of the cauliflower mosaic virus two              
              dsRNA viruses (reo- and rotaviruses) and the core of Sindbis virus.            
                                                                                             
              The primary techniques will depend on fast X-ray diffraction data              
              collection at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source,                      
              data processing on Purdue's Cyber 205 supercomputer, phasing                   
              primarily by use of the noncrystallographic symmetry and model                 
              building and analysis on interactive compute graphics systems.
