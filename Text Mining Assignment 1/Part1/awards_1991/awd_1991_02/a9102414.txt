Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This program focusses on enhancement in ductility in body-centered             
              cubic metals where limitations in dislocation mobility exists.                 
              Ordered intermetallic alloys and body-centered cubic metals are                
              investigated and compared.  Surface film/substrate interfaces and              
              internal precipitate/matrix interfaces are examined under applied              
              static and cyclic stresses.  Metal-to-metal, metal-to-                         
              intermetallic, and intermetallic-to-intermetallic interfaces are               
              included in the study.  Surface film softening phenomena are                   
              investigated with the idea to determine what materials respond to              
              this behavior, factors that control it, and effects of cyclic                  
              deformation.  High resolution transmission electron microscopy and             
              atomic modeling of interfaces will be employed.
