Abstract    :
                   A new method has been developed to search for an                          
              electric-dipole moment of the electron using atomic cesium,                    
              and a factor of twenty improvement has been realized.  With                    
              increased cesium density a further order of magnitude is                       
              anticipated, and another order of magnitude will be pursued by                 
              use of additional and improved cesium cells.  If successful                    
              the project should generate the most stringent experimental                    
              limits on theoretical models that attempt to understand                        
              violations of time-reversal invariance.
