Abstract    :
                   Many asymptotic problems in econometrics can be formulated                
              in terms of empirical processes; and some long-standing problems               
              have been successfully attacked using such techniques.  This                   
              research will explore the binary choice model and its                          
              generalizations by drawing on both empirical process theory and                
              theory for convergence of experiments.  Work on functional                     
              central limit theorems for dependent variables should also extend              
              the applicability of this approach to a wider class of                         
              semiparametric models of great interest in econometrics.  This                 
              research will produce advances in each of the fields of                        
              probability, statistics and econometrics.
