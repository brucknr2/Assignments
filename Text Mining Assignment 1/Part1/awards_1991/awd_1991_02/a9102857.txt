Abstract    :
                   In this project the principal investigator will pursue two                
              complementary areas in numerical analysis and approximation                    
              theory, namely, multivariate spline approximation and                          
              multivariate polynomial interpolation.  With regard to the first               
              area, the principal investigator will continue his study of                    
              multivariate splines on regular and irregular meshes.  He will                 
              also look into the connections between splines and radial basis                
              functions and wavelets.  With regard to the second area, the                   
              principal investigator will further expand his recent discovery                
              of a simple and general method of choosing, for a given finite                 
              set of points in s variables, a "good" polynomial space for                    
              interpolation at those points.                                                 
                   Many problems in differential equations and approximation                 
              theory require the use of numerical algorithms to construct                    
              accurate representations of functions.  Many of these algorithms               
              have developed out of theoretical work on the kinds of basis                   
              functions that can be used to represent functions at a set of                  
              discrete points.  Basis functions are in a very real sense the                 
              "building blocks" out of which continuous functions are created.               
              In this project the principal investigator will study basis                    
              functions called "splines" that are very useful for solving                    
              problems in a number of applied areas.
