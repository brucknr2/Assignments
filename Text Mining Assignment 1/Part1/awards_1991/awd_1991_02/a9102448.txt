Abstract    :
                   This award provides funds for the upgraded spectrometer to                
              be developed sufficiently to check if it is appropriate for                    
              future Class I Optical Sites.  The funding will complete the                   
              upgrading of the instrument (which will be a factor of 20 or so                
              more sensitive than the existing spectrometer) and allow                       
              determinations of its potential usefulness in twilight neutral                 
              composition studies.***//
