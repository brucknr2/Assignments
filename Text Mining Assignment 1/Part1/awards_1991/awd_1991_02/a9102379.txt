Abstract    :
              Research in a procedure for evaluation of structural condition from            
              passive monitoring of response to ambient loadings is proposed.                
              The condition monitoring procedure is fully automated, can                     
              interface directly with computer-based structural maintenance and              
              management systems, and can provide condition information of a                 
              quality and frequency adequate to support an aggressive, proactive             
              maintenance program for structures.  Aggressive maintenance can                
              minimize repair costs and interruptions of service in important                
              structures.  A database of dynamic strain records obtained in a                
              separate testing program conducted at the university of Colorado               
              involving thirty highway bridges of various spans and construction             
              is available as input to the condition monitoring procedure.  With             
              these records a quick and economical evaluation of the condition               
              monitoring method is possible.
