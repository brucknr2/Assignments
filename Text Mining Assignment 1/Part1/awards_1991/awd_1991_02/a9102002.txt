Abstract    :
                   The investigator works in the area of Recursion Theory, in                
              particular, Turing degrees of unsolvability.  Consider the                     
              natural partial ordering of the degrees of sets computable from                
              A.   The investigator will study this in the case where A is                   
              Cohen generic for n-quantifier arithmetic.  A property is not                  
              easily seen to be satisfied in this ordering for n-generic A if                
              it has more complexity than n.  One needs a priority argument as               
              well as a forcing argument.  The investigator is developing this               
              theory.  He has provided a complementation theorem and minimal                 
              cover theorem.  He plans now to study whether these results hold               
              for l-generic degrees.  He will also try to solve isomorphism and              
              automorphism questions which are related to the homogeneity                    
              conjecture for the whole structure of Turing degrees.  These                   
              questions have been open for more than twenty years.                           
                   The degree of computability of a set is measured by its                   
              Turing degree.  Higher degrees signify the need for more powerful              
              computational principles.  Although actual machines cannot embody              
              these higher powers, the mind-set engendered by recursion theory               
              has been fruitful for those studying machine computability.
