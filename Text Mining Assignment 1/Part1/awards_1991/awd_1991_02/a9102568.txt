Abstract    :
              The changes in glacial-interglacial benthic foraminferal                       
              distribution and abundance will be determined, as well as stable               
              isotopes (carbon and oxygen), percent organic carbon,                          
              infaunal/epifaunal ratios, carbonate preservation, and                         
              planktic/benthic ratios.  Benthic foraminifera will be used because            
              their abundance and distribution patterns reflect deep-ocean                   
              conditions.  Based on these patterns, the PI will attempt to                   
              reconstruct informationb (using principal component analysis) about            
              the productivity, dissolved oxygen content and deep circulation of             
              the glacial ocean during the past two complete glacial cycles.
