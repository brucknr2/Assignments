Abstract    :
                   This study is devoted to those coupling processes which                   
              determine the dynamical, thermal, and chemical structure of the                
              lower thermosphere (ca. 90-150 km): dynamical coupling with lower              
              atmosphere regions due to upward propagating gravity waves,                    
              tides, and planetary waves; and vertical and latitudinal                       
              transport of O, NO, Na, and other minor neutral and ionized                    
              species due to dynamical/electrodynamic interactions in the lower              
              thermosphere.  A range of dynamical models will be utilized to                 
              address such problems as self-consistent interaction between                   
              gravity waves, tides, and the mean flow; convective instability                
              arising as a result of such interactions; seasonal/latitudinal                 
              and local time variations in turbulent mixing and "tidal mixing"               
              on the transport of minor species; and the role of gravity waves               
              as a momentum source for the thermosphere.  In addition, a newly               
              developed method of assimilative data analysis will be applied to              
              global measurements of tidal winds and temperatures to provide                 
              (a)  self-consistent global predictions of tidal winds,                        
              temperatures, and densities; and (b)  realistic tidal boundary                 
              conditions for the NCAR Thermosphere-Ionosphere General                        
              Circulation model to study tidal effects on the dynamics and                   
              minor consituent chemistry of the atmospheric region above 100                 
              km.  ***
