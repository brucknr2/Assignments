Abstract    :
                   The concept of a bundle, be it a vector bundle, a principal               
              bundle, or an associated fiber bundle,has been and continues to be             
              a central tool in differential geometry.  Questions in geometry can            
              be analyzed via bundles using the theory of connections.  Moreover,            
              the geometry becomes even richer with the addition of holomorphic              
              ideas.  Various topics to be addressed in this conference are the              
              study of Einstein-Hermitian structures on holomorphic vector                   
              bundles, the concept of a harmonic metric on a complex bundle, and             
              the action of the gauge group of a principal G-bundle on the space             
              of connections.                                                                
                   This grant will partially support a conference entitled                   
              "Bundles in Complex Differential Geometry" to be held March 14-16,             
              1991 at Idaho State University.  The organization of the talks will            
              involve a modified forum wherein the speakers will field questions             
              from the participants on the more detailed  nature of their                    
              particular topic.  Graduate students and junior researchers should             
              be able to profit greatly from this format.
