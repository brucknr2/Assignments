Abstract    :
                   The determination of species specific growth rates in                     
              natural populations is one of the most sought after measurements               
              in phytoplankton ecology.  This research program will                          
              investigate the response of diatom growth rates to perturbations               
              in dissolved silicate supplies using a fluorescent dye (Rhodamine              
              123).  Diatoms incubated in Rhodamine 123 actively accumulate it               
              into the silica deposition vesicle and Rhodamine 123 is co-                    
              deposited with silica.  The resulting valves and girdle bands                  
              become fluorescent and provides a marker for cell division in                  
              diatoms; thus allowing for the estimation of species specific                  
              growth rates.  Experiments will be performed to investigate the                
              potential of low dissolved silicate concentrations to limit the                
              uptake of dissolved silicate and to limit diatom growth rates,                 
              ultimately influencing species succession with changes in ambient              
              dissolved silica supply rates.  The ability to distinguish                     
              between the limitation of uptake and the limitation of growth                  
              rate is critical to our understanding of nutrient limitation in                
              aquatic systems.  In addition, experiments will be performed to                
              investigate the response of diatom growth rate may be a key                    
              factor governing the phytoplankton production to new nutrient                  
              input.
