Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                     This study will use a three.dimensional gravity and                    
              magnetics interpretation of existing geophysical data near the                 
              northern end of the Mariana Trough, which appears to be actively               
              undergoing the transition from rifted to spreading crust. The                  
              study will utilize bathymetric, gravity and magnetics to                       
              calculate standard geophysical parameters and to claculate a sea               
              floor magnetization solution in this backarc basin. The PI will                
              collaborate with the proposed and ongoiong structural and                      
              petrological work of P. Fryer (University of Hawaii) and                       
              scientists from the Geological Survey of Japan.
