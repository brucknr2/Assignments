Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This applicant will study the efforts of site-directed                         
              mutagenesis within the reactive center of alpha-1-proteinase                   
              inhibitor on its global conformation.  Specifically, he plans to               
              use Fourier Transform Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectrometry to               
              study the protein conformation following selective methionine                  
              residue modification and limited proteolysis within the reactive               
              center.  This work is planned to take place in the laboratory of               
              Dr. Peter Gettings at Vanderbilt University.
