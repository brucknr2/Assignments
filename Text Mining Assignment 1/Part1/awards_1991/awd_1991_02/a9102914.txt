Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will continue his study of                     
              connection matrices. The research combines methods from algebraic              
              geometry and the qualitative theory of differential equations.                 
              Topics to be studied include the Conley index, Floer homology, and             
              traveling wave solutions to reaction diffusion equations.                      
                   The connection matrix is a device which formulates certain                
              aspects of partial differential equations in an algebraic                      
              framework. The principal investigator will attempt to develop                  
              computational methods which take advantage of the algebraic                    
              framework and thus obtain more precise qualitative information on              
              the differential equations. The predator - prey problem will be one            
              of the classical problems to which this research will be applied.
