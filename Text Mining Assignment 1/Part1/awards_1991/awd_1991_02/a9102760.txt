Abstract    :
                   This award supports the research of Professor M. Wachs to                 
              work in combinatorics.  She intends to study problems in                       
              enumerative and algebraic combinatorics.  She will focus on the                
              study of generating functions for certain statistics on                        
              combinatorial configurations which include permutations, words                 
              and labeled partially ordered sets.                                            
                   The research is in the general area of combinatorics.                     
              Combinatorics attempts to find efficient methods to study how                  
              discrete collections of objects can be organized.  It is                       
              extremely important to modern communications, for example the                  
              design of large networks as in telephone systems.  It is also                  
              fundamental for the design of new algorithms in computer science.
