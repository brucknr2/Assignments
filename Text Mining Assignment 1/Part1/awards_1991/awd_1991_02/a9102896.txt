Abstract    :
                   This project concerns the study of the structure of classes of            
              functions computable in resource bounded parallel computation models,          
              such as the parallel random access machine and families of boolean             
              circuits.  The project specifically concerns (1) equational logics,            
              higher-type functionals, finite typed lambda calculi and associated            
              programming languages related to the parallel complexity class NC of           
              polylogarithmic time and its subclasses and (2) boolean circuit                
              complexity, the relation between the family of invariance groups of a          
              language and the its parallel complexity, the relation between the             
              "algebraic" structure of a regular language, and characterization of           
              low-level uniform parallel complexity classes in terms of Bel'tyukov's         
              stack-register machines.                                                       
                   This research will use techniques from complexity theory, proof           
              theory (mathematical logic), combinatorics, and finite group theory.           
              The work on equational logics, lambda calculi and higher-type                  
              functionals, and Bel'tyukov machines will build on new recursion               
              theoretic characterizations of the parallel complexity class NC and            
              its subclasses.                                                                
                   The goal of this research is to increase our understanding of             
              parallel complexity classes:  (1) higher type functionals lead to              
              sequential, modular programming languages which compute exactly the            
              functions of certain parallel complexity classes, (2) free variable            
              equational logics shed light on combinatorial principles involving             
              counting and which admit polynomial size Frege proofs, a direction of          
              research related to the N P =? co- N P question, (3) Bel'tyukov                
              machines will clarify questions of containment of low level parallel           
              complexity classes.
