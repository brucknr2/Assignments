Abstract    :
              Dr. Lynda Johnson has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research                     
              Fellowship in Chemistry. Dr. Johnson's doctoral degree was from                
              the California Institute of Technology under the supervision of                
              Professor Robert Grubbs. Dr. Johnson intends to continue                       
              research at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill                    
              under the sponsorship of Professor Maurice Brookhart. As a                     
              postdoctoral fellow, Dr. Johnson will extend her interest in                   
              transition metal catalysts to late-metal, electrophilic                        
              systems. Longer term, she plans to explore the synthesis and                   
              catalytic reactivity of coordinatively unsaturated organocobalt                
              alkoxide complexes.                                                            
              %%%                                                                            
              The Postdoctoral Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as                 
              an important infrastructural program designed to broaden the                   
              knowledge and experience of new Ph.D.s and attract them into                   
              meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research and                       
              teaching.
