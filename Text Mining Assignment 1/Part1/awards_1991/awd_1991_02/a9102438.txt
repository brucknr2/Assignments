Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The study will evaluate changes in the nature of thermocline and               
              nutricline during the last glacial maximum by bathymetric                      
              reconstruction of O-18 and C-13 and organic carbon using a depth               
              transect of cores on the Bahama Banks, and by time-series analysis             
              of isotopic composition of benthic foraminifera in the equatorial              
              and subtropical south Atlantic in intermediate and shallow depth               
              cores.  It will lead to a better understanding of chemical and                 
              physical changes in the structure of thermocline during glacial                
              periods.
