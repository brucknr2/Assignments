Abstract    :
                   The objective of this research is to construct a physical-                
              based plasticity theory that takes account for the plastic                     
              anisotrophy due to large plastic deformation and rotation as well              
              as to study necking and failure criteria due to the growth of                  
              material inhomogeneity and/or geometric imperfection in sheet metal            
              forming processes.  The plasticity theory will be implemented into             
              a finite element code to simulate sheet metal forming processes and            
              the computational results can directly indicate the formability                
              of the sheet metal forming processes.                                          
                   This project will allow the more efficient calculation of                 
              deformations in sheet metal forming, allowing industry to design               
              and build more efficient sheet metal forming dies.
