Abstract    :
              Recently, two general approaches have emerged in machine learning              
              research.  Empirical learning involves inductively acquiring                   
              concept descriptions by examining the similarities and                         
              differences among a large number of examples.  Explanation-based               
              learning (EBL) involves using existing knowledge to explain and                
              generalize single examples and thereby acquire operational                     
              concept descriptions.  However, both of these approaches have                  
              important weaknesses.  Standard empirical methods cannot take                  
              adequate advantage of existing knowledge.  Standard explanation-               
              based methods cannot deal with domain theories which are                       
              incomplete or incorrect.  Our goal is to develop robust and                    
              efficient methods that combine explanation-based and empirical                 
              techniques to refine imperfect concepts and domain theories to                 
              account for a set of empirical data.
