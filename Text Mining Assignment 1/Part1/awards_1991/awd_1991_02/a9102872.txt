Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will continue his study of                     
              Riemannian metrics and spectral geometry. In particular, he will               
              consider the following problems: find conditions for the                       
              solvability of the equation of prescribed scalar curvature on                  
              spheres, find bounds for the Sobolev constant of a Riemannian                  
              manifold in terms of its spectral data, and construct extremal                 
              metrics with respect to functionals arising from spectral                      
              considerations.                                                                
                   The research supported by this award generally will attempt to            
              relate the local geometric information on a manifold or surface                
              with global information about the surface. The local information is            
              given in terms of partial differential equations on the surface and            
              the global information involves globally defined solutions to these            
              partial differential equations. The theme of relating local to                 
              global information is a common one in differential geometry. One of            
              the locally defined operators to be considered here is the                     
              Laplacian which is perhaps the most important operator for                     
              applications to engineering or physics.
