Abstract    :
              In this project homogeneous organometallic complexes will be                   
              used to explore the mechanistic pathways for the                               
              dehydrosulfurization of thiophene, alkyl sulfides, and related                 
              sulfur containing derivatives.  Preliminary experiments                        
              demonstrate that a rhodium complex inserts into the thiophene                  
              C-S bond, thus providing a model for the initial interaction                   
              prior to C-S bond cleavage.  The structures of the                             
              intermediates will be elucidated and the kinetic and                           
              thermodynamic parameters that control the reactivity and                       
              selectivity will be determined.  New complexes will be examined                
              that not only break C-S bonds, but also have the potential to                  
              do further chemistry resulting in the total elimination of                     
              sulfur from the organic portion of the molecule.  Metal centers                
              to be examined include rhodium, rhenium, and molybdenum.

              In this project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and                            
              Organometallic Chemistry Program, Dr. William D. Jones of the                  
              University of Rochester will study the mechanisms of removal of                
              sulfur from a number of organic molecules under homogeneous                    
              conditions at relatively low temperatures.  The studies will                   
              have an impact on problems ranging from air pollution due to                   
              oil combustion (acid rain) to catalyst poisoning in industrial                 
              processes and in catalytic converters.
