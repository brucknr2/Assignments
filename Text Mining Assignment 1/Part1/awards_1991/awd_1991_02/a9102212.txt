Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator intends to continue his study of               
              geodesics and minimal surfaces in manifolds of non-negative                    
              curvature with particular emphasis on manifolds of dimension four.             
              Minimal surface theory will be used to investigate the                         
              relationships between the sectional curvature and topology of a                
              manifold.                                                                      
                   A minimal surface is a surface which may be characterized as              
              one which has minimal surface area for any bounding curve on the               
              surface. It may also be characterized as one which minimizes the               
              "surface tension" energy or which has mean curvature zero. In some             
              sense, a minimal surface is a two dimensional analog of a geodesic,            
              a curve of least length joining two points. The principal                      
              investigator will use the theory of minimal surfaces to study                  
              relationships between the global properties of a space and local               
              properties such as curvature.
