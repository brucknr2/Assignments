Abstract    :
                   Wu plans to continue his study on Dehn surgery and 3-                     
              manifold theory.  The principal task is to search for some                     
              satisfactory understanding of those "exceptional" Dehn surgeries               
              which yield reducible or boundary reducible 3-manifolds.  For the              
              boundary reducibility problems, he will concentrate on the 1-                  
              bridge conjecture for surgeries on knots in handlebodies.  For                 
              the reducibility problems, he will start by searching for more                 
              examples of exceptional Dehn surgeries, as this will hopefully                 
              lead to some intrinsic (probably even a complete) understanding                
              of the reducibility of surgered manifolds.  Also, he will study                
              the cabling conjecture for surgeries on knots in 3-manifolds                   
              which contain a non-separating reducing sphere.                                
                   Three-dimensional manifolds are very basic objects of                     
              geometric interest.  They are spaces which have the local                      
              character of Euclidean 3-space but may be globally much more                   
              complicated.  Examples in two-dimensions are easier to picture --              
              many surfaces are not the plane but would appear to be to ants                 
              crawling on them.  Since we live in a 3-dimensional manifold,                  
              ignoring the time dimension, they are of cosmological interest as              
              well, and there is a surprising amount not known about them.
