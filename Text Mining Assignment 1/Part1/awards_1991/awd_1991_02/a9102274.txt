Abstract    :
              Dr. Ricardo Metz has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research                      
              Fellowship in Chemistry.  Dr. Metz's doctoral degree was from                  
              the University of California at Berkeley under the supervision                 
              of Professor Daniel Neumark. Dr. Metz intends to continue                      
              research at the University of Wisconsin-Madison under the                      
              sponsorship of Professor Fleming Crim. Dr. Metz's area of                      
              postdoctoral research will be the study of bond-selected and                   
              state-resolved bimolecular reactions using overtone                            
              spectroscopy. Longer term, he plans to apply overtone                          
              spectroscopy to the spectroscopy of solvated ions.

              The Postdoctoral Fellowships Program is viewed as an important                 
              infrastructural program designed to broaden the knowledge and                  
              experience of new Ph.D.s and attract them into meaningful                      
              careers in contemporary chemical research and teaching.
