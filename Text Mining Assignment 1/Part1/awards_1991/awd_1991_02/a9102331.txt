Abstract    :
              The purpose of this project is to develop and test a new framework             
              for modeling family decision-making based on game-theoretic                    
              marriage markets.  The first part of the project will integrate                
              altruism into marriage market models. The second part of the study             
              will explore the empirical consequences of such models and their               
              interrelations with bargaining models.  The goal is to produce                 
              structural models of marriage and family demands and to empirically            
              estimate such models.  Understanding the economics of family                   
              decision-making is crucial to many important policy issues,                    
              including the impacts of taxes and subsidies at the macro and micro            
              levels, the implications of varieties of child care and child                  
              support programs, the impacts of aid to developing countries, as               
              well as marriage, divorce, fertility, births to unwed mothers and              
              mortality rates by age and sex.
