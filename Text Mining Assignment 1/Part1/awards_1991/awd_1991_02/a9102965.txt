Abstract    :
                   Professor McCarthy's research project will cover a number of              
              areas in Hilbert space operator theory and complex analysis: (a) He            
              will extend some aspects of the theory of Toeplitz operators to the            
              setting of logmodular algebras. (b) He will investigate the                    
              boundedness of Toeplitz operators on Hilbert spaces of analytic                
              functions. (c) He will study questions dealing with Toeplitz                   
              operators in several complex variables.                                        
                   Hilbert space operators are essentially infinite matrices of              
              complex numbers.  These operators have applications in every area              
              of applied science as well as in pure mathematics.  This type of               
              research is an attempt to classify certain important families of               
              such objects.
