Abstract    :
                   The sensitivity of resonant bar gravitational wave                        
              detectors can potentially be increased by another two orders                   
              of magnitude.  A key step in achieving this goal is the                        
              development of novel electromechanical transducers.  Professor                 
              Bocko's research will seek to perfect a parametric transducer                  
              which converts extremely small mechanical vibrations of the                    
              bar antenna to an electrical signal by modulation of a                         
              capacitance in a superconducting radio-frequency bridge                        
              circuit.                                                                       
                   This transducer design will be available to other groups                  
              to extend the range of the most advanced large antennas.  It                   
              will also allow the development of small receivers with                        
              interesting sensitivity levels for searches for gravitational                  
              waves in our galaxy.
