Abstract    :
                   In this project the principal investigator is proposing a                 
              new numerical method for the study of the behavior of solids                   
              suspended in a viscous fluid.  The method combines finite                      
              difference approximations to solve the field equations with                    
              Lagrangian fluid markers to track the positions of the solid                   
              particles in the fluid.  The suspended material is replaced with               
              an appropriate force-density term in the equations of fluid                    
              motion.  This method is capable of handling a large number of                  
              particles since there is no need to specify boundary conditions                
              on the surface of each particle and since one set of                           
              equations obtains in the whole flow field.                                     
                   The behavior of particles suspended in a viscous fluid is an              
              interesting physical phenomenon that has wide-ranging                          
              biological and technological importance.  In this project the                  
              principal investigator will apply a novel numerical method in                  
              order to solve approximately the coupled fluid-solid equations                 
              that describe the motion of solid particles suspended in a fluid               
              under realistic general conditions.  The need for accurate                     
              simulations of such suspension flows arises in areas as diverse                
              as medicine (blood flow), civil engineering (control of                        
              sedimentation in rivers) and design manufacturing (ceramics and                
              composite materials).
