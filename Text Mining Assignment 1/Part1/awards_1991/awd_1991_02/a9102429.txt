Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A new quantitative investigation into the morphology of shallow                
              estuaries and inlets will be carried out using a combination of                
              numerical modeling with finite element methods (FEM) and field                 
              experiments.  An assessment of the relative importance of                      
              continuous tidal forcing and infrequent storm events to sediment               
              transport and resulting evolution of estuaries will follow.
