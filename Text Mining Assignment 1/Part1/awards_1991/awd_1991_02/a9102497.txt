Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Visualization provides an efficient and powerful means of                      
              comprehending complex numeric data.  This project investigates                 
              approaches to visualization of sampled volumetric data, such as                
              that produced by computational fluid dynamics, tomography, and                 
              molecular simulations, particularly those volumes where the                    
              samples are irregularly distributed in space.  Two common methods              
              for visualization are:  1)  to extract features of interest (such              
              as isosurfaces); and 2)  to image the while volume as a                        
              continuous semi-transparent medium.  Most present approaches to                
              visualization are designed for regular rectilinear grids.  This                
              project will extend and generalize these approaches to                         
              visualization of data in the less regular formats which are found              
              in many applications.  The two main approaches will be:  1)  to                
              extend existing algorithms to irregular volumes; and 2)  to                    
              resample the irregular volumes to hierarchical regular volumes.                
              Another aspect of this research is to carefully compare different              
              approaches to certain aspects of visualization, particularly, the              
              "resampling" (interpolation) of 3D data, the mapping from numeric              
              data to visual parameters such as color and transparency, and                  
              methods of efficient volume traversal.
