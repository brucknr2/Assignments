Abstract    :
              An efficient high speed computing environment is essential for                 
              protein and virus crystallography.  X-ray data collection, data                
              processing, phasing of structure amplitudes, constructing                      
              molecular models and structure refinement are all computationally              
              intensive procedures.  This award will continue the support of                 
              the computing specialists in the crystallography group at Purdue.              
              In particular the group will pursue the following specific                     
              computing objectives:  generalizing codes to make programs                     
              machine independent, develop detector and computer independent                 
              software for analysis and processing of X-ray data, continue                   
              software development for the determination of phases of structure              
              factors.
