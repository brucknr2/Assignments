Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will continue his work on Markov               
              processes in population genetics.  Several specific problems will              
              be studied.  For example, the investigator will study the two-                 
              locus diffusion model of Ohta, incorporating gene conversion.                  
              Another example is the coupling of the coalescent (genealogical)               
              and diffusion versions of the infinitely-many-neutral alleles                  
              model.
