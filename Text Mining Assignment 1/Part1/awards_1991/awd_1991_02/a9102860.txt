Abstract    :
              This award addresses the problem of reconstructing a three-                    
              dimensional object from a set of planar contours (cross-                       
              sections).  This is an important problem in many research areas.               
              For example, biologists, medical clinicians, and quality control               
              inspectors all try to understand the shape of objects, based on                
              serial sections.  There are two basic approaches to the problem:               
              volume-based and surface-based reconstruction.  If the spacing                 
              between the sections is relatively small, then the  volume-based               
              approach is preferred and the intermediate contours may not be                 
              necessary.  However, when the spacing between sections is large,               
              a surface-based approach is necessary.  This research will                     
              continue the Principal Investigator's investigations into                      
              reconstruction surfaces from sparsely-spaced planar contours,                  
              using a surface-based approach and comparing it with volume-                   
              based approaches.  The algorithms and methods developed should be              
              useful in both scientific and industrial applications.
