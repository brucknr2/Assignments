Abstract    :
              This award supports collaborative research on the chemistry                    
              of natural compounds.  It will be conducted by Dr. David                       
              Kingston of the Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State                         
              University in cooperation with Alphonse Kelecom of the                         
              Federal University in Fluminense, Brazil.  This work is                        
              aimed at the isolation and structure elucidation of novel                      
              chemical compounds from Brazilian plants and marine organisms.                 
              Both plants and marine organisms have proved important                         
              sources of novel antitumor agents, and it is expected that a                   
              continued search of Brazilian flora and marine species will                    
              yield additional useful compounds.                                             
                                                                                             
              The work in Brazil will be carried out by Dr. Kelecom, who                     
              will make both marine and terrestrial collections and perform                  
              preliminary bioassys and isolations.  The work in the U.S.A.                   
              will be carried out by Professor Kingston and his group,                       
              and will include the final purification of bioactive                           
              constituents and their structure elucidation.  The major                       
              benefit of this project to Dr. Kelecom is that it gives him                    
              access to the necessary equipment and expertise to complete                    
              the isolation and structure elucidation.  The major benefit                    
              to Dr. Kingston is that it gives him access to an enlarged                     
              group of plants and marine organisms for the isolation of                      
              natural compounds.
