Abstract    :
                   This proposal requests funds from the NSF/CEDAR program to                
              initiate an engineering feasibility study for some elements of                 
              the Polar Cap Observatory (PCO).  This design study will strongly              
              benefit the CEDAR community in promoting the concept of a Class I              
              facility, and will begin the "Next Step-An Upper Atmospheric                   
              Initiative for the 1990's."  Completion of the design study in                 
              1991 will better define the cost of realizing the PCO, and will                
              permit the issuance of an annoucement of opportunity for                       
              instrument and observatory construction in 1992.  With such a                  
              schedule, PCO operations could begin as early as 1995, thereby                 
              supporting and complementing the major activities of the NASA                  
              ISTP program and broader "Global Change" initiatives.***//
