Abstract    :
              This award will support Professor John Mullet of Texas A & M                   
              University in a research collaboration with Dr. Alejandra                      
              Covarrubias of the Plant Biotechnolgy Center in Cuernavaca,                    
              Mexico.  The purpose of the research is to identify genes in                   
              plants that contribute to drought tolerance, drought avoidance                 
              and water use efficiency.  Identification of these genes will                  
              allow new approaches to improve drought tolerance in crop                      
              species.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              The researchers will collaborate in the identification of                      
              genes induced in response to water deficit in Sorghum and                      
              Phaseolus.  Sorghum will be studied because it is a drought                    
              tolerant cereal; Phaseolus varieties also share desiccation                    
              tolerance and the plant is an important source of food in                      
              Mexico.  The analysis will focus on specific genes and study                   
              the role of abscisic acid in induced desiccation tolerance.                    
              In addition, the researchers will map the location of abscisic                 
              acid modulated genes on the RFLP map of Sorghum to help                        
              establish relationships between specific genes and drought                     
              tolerance under field conditions.  The proposed collaboration                  
              will be of benefit to the U.S. side in extending their                         
              collection of genes to genes induced in response to more                       
              severe water deficits and genes responsive to abscisic acid,                   
              while the Mexican side will benefit from access to the U.S.                    
              researcher's gene collection and related information.
