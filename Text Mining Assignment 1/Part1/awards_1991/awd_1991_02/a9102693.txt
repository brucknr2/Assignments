Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Scientists and engineers are an underutilized resource in                 
              motivating students and assisting classroom teachers in                        
              teaching science.  Pilot programs have demonstrated the value                  
              of preparing scientists for what to expect when they enter the                 
              classroom, how to incorporate the school curriculum into their                 
              program, and how best to reach the goal of making their visits                 
              a "never to be forgotten" life changing experience for                         
              students.  The concept of a Survival Kit is an outgrowth of a                  
              Scientist-in-Residence program at the North Carolina Museum of                 
              Life and Science which has successfully matched scientists and                 
              public school classrooms locally since 1982.                                   
                                                                                             
                   The North Carolina Museum of Life and Science proposes to                 
              conduct meetings for staff and outside educational specialists                 
              to identify the materials and strategies needed to prepare                     
              scientists to enter school classrooms.  The final report of                    
              these meetings will include mechanicals of a Scientist Survival                
              Kit, which can be disseminated across the country, and an                      
              evaluation report of how the kits can be and are used.                         
                                                                                             
                   Dr. Mark St. John, Inverness Associates, a professional                   
              evaluator noted for his work with nationally significant                       
              science education projects, will provide local and national                    
              evaluation through surveys and meetings to give a picture of                   
              the issues involved in establishing and maintaining programs of                
              scientists in the schools and the role played by the                           
              Scientist's Survival Kit in furthering this aim.
