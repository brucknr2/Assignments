Abstract    :
              This proposal requests funds to purchase two multi-user                        
              instruments for oligonucleotide and peptide synthesis.  An                     
              Automated Oligonucleotide Synthesizer would allow uninterrupted                
              core DNA service by replacing an old, undependable and                         
              inefficient instrument.  A Multiple Peptide Synthesizer would                  
              allow improvements in basic research projects currently hampered               
              by the expense and time required for synthesis of a large number               
              of peptide analogs.                                                            
                                                                                             
              The major users would be NIH/NSF funded researchers in the                     
              Colleges of Agriculture, Arts and Sciences, Medicine, and the                  
              Arizona Research Laboratories (an interdisciplinary division).                 
              The instruments would be housed in the Macromolecular Structures               
              Facility established by the Division of Biotechnology.  Skilled                
              personnel will operate, maintain and train other users.                        
                                                                                             
              THe specific research that would be enhanced by these instruments              
              includes:  the molecular biological basis for cell                             
              differentiation and morphology; plant gene expression and                      
              responses to biological stresses (salt, low water, heat); heat                 
              shock proteins; RNA processing, protein transport and gene                     
              expression in chloroplasts; yeast mRNA stability; gene                         
              transcription regulation and self-processing; cytokeratin                      
              immunology and biochemistry; expression of insect protease                     
              inhibitors; insect endocrinology; insect protein, lipid, and                   
              structure function studies; total immune system evolution;                     
              electron transport protein biochemistry and studies on                         
              peptide/protein conformational constraints, hormone receptor                   
              recognition and structure/function studies.
