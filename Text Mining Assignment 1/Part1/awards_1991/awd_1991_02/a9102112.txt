Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              In this project, the P.I.'s will analyze a unique variety of                   
              oceanographic and satellite-derived data taken from 1988 to 1990               
              in the confluence region of the Brazil Current and the Malvinas                
              Current east of Argentina.  Data were collected in a joint effort              
              involving US, Argentine, and French scientists.  Studies will be               
              made of the relation between local atmospheric forcing and local               
              circulation, meridional motions of the Brazil Current, and the                 
              transport of the two currents separately.
