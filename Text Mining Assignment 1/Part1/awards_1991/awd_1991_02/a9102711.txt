Abstract    :
                   The investigator intends to study questions involving the                 
              symmetry properties of manifolds and the existence of riemannian               
              metrics with weak curvature properties on manifolds.  The                      
              symmetry investigations will include questions about low-                      
              dimensional manifolds and the applications of surgery theory and               
              homotopy theory to problems involving higher-dimensional                       
              manifolds; much of the latter will involve symmetries whose                    
              singular sets have relatively large dimension and comparing the                
              possible classifications of such actions with cases where the                  
              singular set dimension is relatively small.  All these problems                
              will be studied by a combination of methods from algebraic and                 
              geometric topology, with input from stable and unstable homotopy               
              theory, the theory of surgery on manifolds, topological and                    
              differentiable transformation groups, and low-dimensional                      
              topological methods, including gauge theory.  The objective of                 
              the work is an improved understanding of some questions about the              
              existence of positively curved metrics and the existence and                   
              classification of certain symmetries; these questions have                     
              generally arisen in connection with recent advances in geometric               
              topology.                                                                      
                   Manifolds are ubiquitons in mathematics, arising naturally                
              as the solutions of systems of equations in higher dimensional                 
              spaces.  As to low-dimensional manifolds, we live in one,                      
              three-dimensional or four-dimensional, depending on whether the                
              time dimension is considered as well as the three space                        
              dimensions.  More information about symmetries of manifolds,                   
              their curvature, and other properties is thus bound to be useful.
