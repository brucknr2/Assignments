Abstract    :
              This proposal is concerned with the development and analysis of a              
              class of robust adaptive filtering algorithms which can offer                  
              effective performance in an environment of impulsive and other non-            
              gaussian noise.  These filters are termed Order Statistic Least                
              Mean Square (OSLMS) adaptive filters.  A special case of this class            
              is the Median LMS (MLMS) algorithm, derived from the familiar LMS              
              algorithm by replacing the instantaneous measurements of the                   
              gradient of the mean square error performance surface, used by the             
              LMS filter, with the sample median of that quantity.
