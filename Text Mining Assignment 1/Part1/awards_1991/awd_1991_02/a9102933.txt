Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                                                                                            
              Objective of this work characterize Li isotopic composition of                 
              major reservoirs and apply isotopic systematics to probe the                   
              nature and magnitude of element transfer during various marine                 
              processes.  Specific research will include (1) estimation of                   
              the flux of Li isotopes from continental runoff; (2) study of                  
              seawater-ocean crust exchange as reflected in the distribution                 
              of Li isotopes in metabasalts, hydrothermal fluids and                         
              weathered seafloor basalt; (3) assessment of the Li in the                     
              ocean; and (4) evaluation of the element cycling processes at                  
              convergent plate margins including island arcs and continental                 
              margins.  The results of this study will constitute the first                  
              comprehensive Li isotope data which not only will characterize                 
              the geochemical cycle of Li but can serve as a basis for                       
              understanding oceanic processes that have significant                          
              geochemical and geophysical implications.
