Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research is aimed at an understanding of the relationship                 
              between active galactic nuclei (AGN) and giant radio galaxies, the             
              largest known connected objects in the universe.  The variability              
              observed in the radiation of AGN is believed to be related to gas              
              flows into supermassive black holed, and radio galaxies are                    
              observed to be fed by jets which emanate from AGN.  Utilizing                  
              hydrodynamic codes on supercomputers, jet propagation through                  
              galactic and extragalactic media will be studied.
