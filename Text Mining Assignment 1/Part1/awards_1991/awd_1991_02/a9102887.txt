Abstract    :
                   Professor Pesin will study the stochastic behavior of                     
              trajectories in smooth dissipative dynamical systems with                      
              singularities having attractors which are close to classical                   
              hyperbolic attractors. The object will be to describe the geometric            
              structure of the attractors by calculating their dimension like                
              characteristics. The principal investigator will also consider the             
              appearance of space-time chaos in the lattice models which are                 
              constructed as a chain of strongly hyperbolic dynamical systems.               
                   This research involves random dynamical systems. These systems            
              are used to model the behavior of large numbers of interacting                 
              particles and therefore the potential applications are significant.            
              Previous work of Professor Pesin has recently become important                 
              because it gave considerable information on the dimension                      
              parameters of the attractors of the system. There is an indication             
              that the current research will also find immediate application.
