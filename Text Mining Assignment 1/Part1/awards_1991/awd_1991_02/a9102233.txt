Abstract    :
                   Professor Zucker will work on locally symmetric spaces as well            
              as transcendental methods in algebraic geometry.  He will also                 
              study Torelli type questions for fibre spaces.  Professor                      
              Karpishpan will work on Hodge theory from the point of view of                 
              deformation theory, using differential Lie algebras.                           
                   This project falls into the general area of arithmetic                    
              geometry -a subject that blends two of the oldest areas of                     
              mathematics: number theory and geometry.  This combination has                 
              proved extraordinarily fruitful - having recently solved problems              
              that withstood generations.  Among its many consequences are new               
              error correcting codes.  Such codes are essential for both modern              
              computers (hard disks) and compact disks.
