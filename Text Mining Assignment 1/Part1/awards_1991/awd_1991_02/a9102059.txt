Abstract    :
                   This project will study eigenvalue optimization and robust                
              methods in nonlinear programming.  The research on eigenvalue                  
              optimization will consider variational properties of the spectral              
              radius map and the mapping that yields the maximum real part of                
              the spectrum.  Robust global algorithms and robust local theory                
              using the behavior of convex composite functions will be                       
              developed.  Particular attention will be given to techniques that              
              permit the relaxation of regularity hypotheses.                                
                   This research has applications in modeling complex chemical               
              processes, optimal design of structures, feedback stabilization,               
              and stabilization of dynamical systems.
