Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This is a field and laboratory study of off-axis                          
              flow-line sampling to test for petrologic temporal variability.                
              To avoid the petrologic complications that exist near large EPR                
              offsets the study will be sample the EPR at 13 degrees 13-17                   
              minutes north. Two paired and symmertical flow-line sampling                   
              transects, separated by 7 km, will be occupied. The goal is to                 
              determine whether the composition of the ocean crust varies                    
              episodically, quasi-periodically, or not at all.
