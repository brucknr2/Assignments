Abstract    :
                   The chemistry and mineralogy of air-borne components of                   
              marine sediments can be used to trace the source location of the               
              dust.  From these data it is possible then to trace the                        
              trajectory of air masses and winds at times in the past.  This                 
              proposal requests support to develop a formal data base of                     
              surface sediment mineralogy, aerosol mineralogy, and air mass                  
              trajectory for the Pacific Ocean.  These data can then be used to              
              reconstruct past winds and air mass movements with greater                     
              accuracy.                                                                      
                   The research is important because the reconstruction of past              
              wind directions and intensities provides important information                 
              about how the atmosphere responded to past climate change.  Past               
              wind intensities and directions also help to test the sensitivity              
              of General Circulation Models, since wind direction and intensity              
              are principal output from these numerical simulations.
