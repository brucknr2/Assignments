Abstract    :
                   A primary focus of this project will be the development                   
              and application of the Light Front Tamm-Dancoff approach to                    
              field theory.  This approach may provide an alternative to the                 
              lattice for a rigorous study of nonperturbative field theory,                  
              and in particular for the relativistic bound state problem.
