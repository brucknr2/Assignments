Abstract    :
              This is an award for conduct of research the objective of                      
              which is to determination the technical and commercial                         
              feasibility of a windowless exit portal for an electron                        
              beam emerging from an accelerator tube for use in                              
              irradiation of gases, liquids and solids.  The research                        
              objectives include determination of the optimum design of                      
              a transverse nozzle for the windowless design, analysis of                     
              the scattering losses, design and production of a complete                     
              electron-optical and vacuum system for the electron beam                       
              acceleration tube.  Results are expected to provide the                        
              basis for design and fabrication of a prototype device                         
              potentially useful for wastewater treatment,                                   
              decontamination of hazardous organic substances,                               
              disinfection of water, treatment of exhaust gases derived                      
              from the combustion of fossil fuels.                                           
                                                                                             
              This is an award for support of Phase II of a project,                         
              Phase I of which was initiated under NSF Grant No. 89-                         
              60943 under conditions stated in Program Solicitation NSF                      
              89-30, Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR).  Results                     
              are expected to provide the basis for engineering design                       
              of innovative processes and systems to remove                                  
              environmental pollutants from waste streams.
