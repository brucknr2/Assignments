Abstract    :
              The proposed work is the continuation and conclusion of the                    
              analysis of acoustic oceanographic data obtained by the                        
              principal investigator in the Greenland Sea Tomography                         
              Experiment. This experiment, conducted during 1988-89,                         
              consisted of a pentagonal array of five acoustic                               
              transceivers with a sixth moored in the center.  The                           
              goals of the experiment were to study the episodic formation                   
              of Greenland Sea Deep Water, the response of the Greenland                     
              Sea gyre to variations in wind stress and ice cover, and the                   
              propagation of acoustic energy in the marginal ice zone.                       
              The large data set obtained in this experiment, as well as a                   
              concurrent moving ship tomography test, and several other                      
              oceanographic studies, is currently being analyzed at four                     
              academic institutions.  This project will not only improve                     
              our understanding of deep water formation and circulation,                     
              but is also an excellent test of the utility of acoustic                       
              information in defining oceanographic processes.
