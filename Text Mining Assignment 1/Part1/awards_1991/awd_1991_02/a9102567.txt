Abstract    :
                   The objective of this research is to develop a new interactive            
              tool for the kinematic design of single and multi-degree of freedom            
              spatial mechanisms and robot systems.  The goal is to provide a                
              designer the ability to identify the dimensions of a spatial                   
              linkage which guides the movement of a workpiece in three                      
              dimensional space.                                                             
                   Spatial mechanisms are now found primarily in the form of                 
              robot manipulators.  Mechanical hands, walking machines, and multi-            
              armed robot systems are examples of more complicated spatial                   
              mechanisms that will be impacted by this research.
