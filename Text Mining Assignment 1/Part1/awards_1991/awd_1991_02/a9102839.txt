Abstract    :
              This proposal requests funds to purchase a quadrupole mass                     
              spectrometer which would serve as the basis of a core mass                     
              spectrometry facility, to be located on the UNR campus.  The                   
              instrument would be used to support the research of the six major              
              users whose programs are described in this proposal, along with                
              those listed as minor users.  The demand generated by this level               
              of research activity exceeds the capabilities of existing mass                 
              spectrometry instrumentation at our university.                                
                                                                                             
              The university has agreed to pay 152,161 dollars towards the                   
              total cost of 304,322 dollars.  The requested level of funding                 
              from NSF is the remaining 152,161 dollars.  This figure reflects               
              only the cost of the instrumentation itself.  UNR will pay for                 
              the site renovation, operation, maintenance, and installation.
