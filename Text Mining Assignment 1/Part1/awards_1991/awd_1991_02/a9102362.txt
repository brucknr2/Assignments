Abstract    :
              This award will support a U.S.-Mexico workshop on materials                    
              science and engineering to be held in Ixtapa, Mexico during                    
              September 24-27, 1991.  The workshop, organized by Professors                  
              Juan Sanchez and John Tien of the University of Texas, Austin                  
              for the U.S side and Professor Jose L. Moran-Lopez of the                      
              Universidad Autonoma de San Luis de Potosi for the Mexican                     
              side, will serve to foster direct interactions between U.S. and                
              Mexican scientists, engineers and research administrators;                     
              will explore areas of common interest in materials science and                 
              engineering; and will produce a materials treatise that is                     
              expected to offer important guidelines for the development of                  
              advanced materials research.                                                   
                                                                                             
              The three day meeting will consist of five technical sessions                  
              and one half-day panel discussion.  Participation by university                
              and industry-based scientists and engineers, as well as from the               
              government, will ensure that the meeting will be of wide scope,                
              covering pivotal topics in materials, their science, their                     
              properties, and their processing and uses.
