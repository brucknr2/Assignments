Abstract    :
              In May, 1989, the National Science Foundation, NOAA                            
              (Office of Marine Assessment), the Max and Victoria                            
              Dreyfus Foundation, the New Jersey Marine Sciences                             
              Consortium, the Paul Hall Endowment of the University of                       
              Southern California, and the Port Authority of New York                        
              and New Jersey supported the first International Symposium                     
              on Coastal Ocean Space Utilization (COSU I) held at the                        
              offices of the Port Authority at the World Trade Center in                     
              New York City.  The purpose of the three-day meeting was                       
              to bring together an international group of senior experts                     
              in coastal ocean management and development to discuss the                     
              implications of new technology on coastal management                           
              policies throughout the world.                                                 
                                                                                             
              The success of that conference was manifested by the                           
              substantial attendance from around the globe.  During the                      
              three days of discussions, over 175 individuals                                
              participated.  The discussions, all held in plenary                            
              sessions, were designed to provide an opportunity for                          
              discussion of international developments that were                             
              potentially useful to all coastal nations and regions                          
              facing similar environmental, political, social and                            
              economic challenges.  While it was not designed to be a                        
              technology transfer conference, certainly the outcome of                       
              the meeting was the communication of ideas for improved                        
              management of multiple uses in the coastal environment.                        
                                                                                             
              The grant provides support for the preparation of a second                     
              COSU meeting.  Primary activities include:
