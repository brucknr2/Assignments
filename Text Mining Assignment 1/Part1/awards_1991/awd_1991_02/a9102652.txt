Abstract    :
                   Professor Grant will work on various aspects of the arithmetic            
              of curves of genus two.  He will study integer points on these                 
              curves, certain units arising from curves of genus two, and new                
              methods for calculating the Mordell-Weil rank of such curves.                  
                   This project falls into the general area of arithmetic                    
              geometry -a subject that blends two of the oldest areas of                     
              mathematics: number theory and geometry.  This combination has                 
              proved extraordinarily fruitful - having recently solved problems              
              that withstood generations.  Among its many consequences are new               
              error correcting codes.  Such codes are essential for both modern              
              computers (hard disks) and compact disks.
