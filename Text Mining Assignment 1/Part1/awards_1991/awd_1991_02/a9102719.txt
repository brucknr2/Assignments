Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The PI's recently discovered spontaneous, monodisperse,                        
              equilibrium vesicles in many mixtures of anionic and cationic                  
              surfactants.  In this program, they will characterize                          
              experimentally and model theoretically the process of vesicle                  
              formation in these systems.  This work will uncover a rich new                 
                                                                                             
              area of surfactant phase behavior and suggest new formations                   
              for stable vesicles useful in addressing theoretical and                       
              practical problems.  They will use a combination of                            
              experimental techniques including light, x-ray and neutron                     
              scattering, fluorescent probes, rheological measurements, and                  
              electron microscopy.  Simultaneously they will approach the                    
              problem from two distinct and complementary theoretical                        
              directions.  This work is significant because the properties                   
              of vesicles in these mixtures and the nature of the micelle-                   
              vesicle and vesicle-liquid crystal transitions is of keen                      
              scientific interest and considerable practical importance.                     
              This project has a broad scope and in order to achieve these                   
              goals expeditiously they will collaborate with several                         
              industrial and academic researchers.
