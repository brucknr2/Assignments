Abstract    :
              The studies in this proposal are focused on the analysis of motion             
              by living organisms or individual cells either through live video              
              image or videotaped records of movement patterns.  The CellTrakTM              
              motion analysis system, with its proprietary video processor, is               
              the primary instrument in the request.  CellTrakTM is based on video           
              "frame-grabber" technology:  digitization of the video frames and              
              subsequent computerized analysis of the digitized images in a time             
              framework.  It has been designed to trace paths of movement from               
              video records and then analyze the path shapes using algorithms                
              that calculate speed, direction, frequency of turning, path length,            
              and other parameters related to motion.  CellTrakTM will be used in            
              three distinct areas of research:  1) to analyze the social                    
              correlates of foraging behavior of ants; 2) to examine chemotactic             
              swimming behavior of scallop sperm in relation to egg-derived                  
              attractants and fertilization; 3) to investigate the role of                   
              specific membrane receptors and trans-membrane ion fluxes in                   
              chemosensory behavior of Paramecium.  The requested equipment also             
              includes a static image processor software accessory (BioscanR                 
              OptimasTM) which will be used in conjunction with CellTrakTM for the           
              analysis of low-contrast video images or whenever contrast                     
              enhancement preprocessing is necessary before accurate analysis of             
              movement can be obtained.
