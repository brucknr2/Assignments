Abstract    :
              A prototype was developed in Phase I for measuring the thermal                 
              conductivity of thin films, proving the capabilities of a                      
              measuring technique in the range not covered by any other                      
              existing commercial equipment.  The measurement method is based                
              on the definition of the thermal resistance, as opposed to the                 
              mostly indirect methods used in the past.  Its operating range                 
              extends from thin optical films to bulk materials.  The                        
              technique was verified by measurements of thin and thick bulk                  
              samples and the results closely correlate with the published                   
              values for those materials.  Final testing was accomplished by                 
              successfully measuring two micrometer thick SiO2 films deposited               
              on single crystal silicon substrates.  During Phase II the                     
              performance of the system will be significantly improved,                      
              leading to a useful commercial instrument.  Modifications are                  
              planned for the sensor head, electronic circuit and control                    
              software.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              Development and commercial availability of a nondestructive test               
              for thermal conductivity and interface thermal resistance in                   
              dielectric and other thin films will permit rapid advances to                  
              be made in the design and construction of multilayer structures                
              with improved heat flow characteristics.  Several technologies                 
              will be aided by this instrument, with applications in high                    
              speed electronics, optics, optical and magneto-optical                         
              recording, thin films, superconducting films, as well as                       
              diamond-like coatings.
