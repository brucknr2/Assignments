Abstract    :
                   This project will consider robust stability and sensitivity               
              of general input-output systems that do not necessarily have the               
              structure of a feedback system.  It is assumed that such systems               
              are governed by operator equations which relate the input, the                 
              state and the output, and which depend on a parameter.  In                     
              particular such or parameter can be the transmission operator of               
              a system block.                                                                
                   Results from this project will improve available theory, and              
              furnish useful tools for the design of nonlinear systems.  The                 
              techniques are general enough to apply to mechanical, electrical,              
              and chemical systems.
