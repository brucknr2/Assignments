Abstract    :
                   This award provides funds to coordinate the optical CEDAR                 
              community, in particular experts in optical interferometry and                 
              spectroscopy, in order to recommend instrumentations for the                   
              optical component of the Polar Cap Observatory (PCO).  The                     
              selection of instrumentations will be based upon a consensus                   
              reached through workshops attended by experts in this field                    
              addressing the need to 1) evaluate parameters and requirements                 
              for the interferometers and spectrometers at the PCO, 2) indicate              
              the current capabilities of present state of the art                           
              instrumentation, and 3) estimate the costs for outfitting the PCO              
              with an appropriate complement of Class I interferometers and                  
              spectrometers.***
