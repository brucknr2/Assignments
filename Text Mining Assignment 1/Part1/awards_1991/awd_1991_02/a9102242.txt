Abstract    :
              Dr. Andrea Cochran has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research                    
              Fellowship in Chemistry. Dr. Cochran's doctoral degree was from                
              the University of California at Berkeley under the supervision                 
              of Professor Peter Schultz.  Dr. Cochran intends to continue                   
              research at the Whitehead Institute under the sponsorship of                   
              Professor Peter Kim. Dr. Cochran's area of postdoctoral                        
              research will be protein structure and folding. Longer term,                   
              she plans to study the molecular mechanism of transmembrane                    
              signalling in proteins. Signal transduction is of central                      
              importance in immunology and oncology.

              The Postdoctoral Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as                 
              an important infrastructural program designed to broaden the                   
              knowledge and experience of new Ph.D.s and attract them into                   
              meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research and                       
              teaching.
