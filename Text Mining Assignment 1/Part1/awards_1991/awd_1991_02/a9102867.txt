Abstract    :
                   Probability models can be used to distinguish naturally                   
              occurring clusters of observations even when these observations                
              are intermixed and unlabelled.  Established theory draws on                    
              mixture models, modal models, and, for evolutionary                            
              classification, generalized Markov models.  This research                      
              introduces and investigates a new class of probability models:                 
              product partition models.  These will have wide application in                 
              determining classifications and in predicting based on partial or              
              complete classifications.  Applications for these classification               
              algorithms include the construction of evolutionary trees,                     
              recognition of change-points for modelled processes, image                     
              reconstruction, and failure prediction for complex cases like the              
              space shuttle.
