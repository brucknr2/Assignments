Abstract    :
              Database management systems efficiently organize, access and                   
              manipulate enormous quantities of data for traditional business                
              applications. This efficiency is based on indexing records by one              
              attribute, such as social security number. However, new                        
              applications in both science and business require indexing on                  
              several attributes. Astronomers and geographers want data to be                
              organized spatially; businesses want to study trends over time.                
              This project continues work on spatial and temporal indexes which              
              have already been demonstrated to be efficient.  A new node                    
              consolidation and concurrency algorithm will be applied to the                 
              Holey Brick tree, a spatial index with guarantees for space                    
              utilization and query speed. This will enable scientists to make               
              sophisticated queries on spatial data while records are being                  
              inserted and deleted.  The Time Split B-tree (a time-and-key                   
              based indexing system) will be enhanced by limiting the time-                  
              interval size and by managing the timestamping of records.  Last,              
              ways are being found to create indexes and do other                            
              reorganizations of data while the DBMS is online.The results of                
              this project will aid in the management of anticipated non-                    
              traditional applications on massive collections of data in both                
              science and in business.
