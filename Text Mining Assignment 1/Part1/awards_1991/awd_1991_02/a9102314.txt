Abstract    :
                   This proposal sustains efforts to characterize exospheric                  
                  conditions and coupling with the ionosphere and                            
                  thermosphere.  Three campaigns for simultaneous observations               
                  of the geocoronal Ha (6563 A) emission and incoherent                      
                  scatter radar  measurements of the topside ionosphere at                   
                  Arecibo, PR are planned and a single campaign at                           
                  Sondrestromfjord, Greenland is planned.  The project also                  
                  takes responsibility for advanced analysis of the extant
