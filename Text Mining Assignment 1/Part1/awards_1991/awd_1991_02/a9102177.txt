Abstract    :
                   Realistic characterization and understanding of the mechanical            
              response of materials and interfaces in semiconductor devices such             
              as chip-substrate and packaging are vital for improved and                     
              competitive designs in manufacturing.  Most of the previously used             
              constitutive models do not account for important factors such as               
              inelastic response, fracture, damage, delamination and degradation             
              under thermomechanical and viscous (creep) effects, in an                      
              integrated manner.  The objective of the research is to develop a              
              unified modeling approach that will allow incorporation of the                 
              above factors in the behavior of both solid materials and                      
              interfaces in the semiconductor devices.  The models thus developed            
              will be verified with respect to available test results from                   
              laboratory measurements.                                                       
                   Semiconductor devices are extremely complex systems, often                
              involving interfaces between brittle and ductile materials.                    
              Because of the complexity of the system, failures are hard to                  
              predict and, therefore, failure-resistant designs are difficult to             
              achieve.  The reseach work will develop a much more sophisticated              
              approach to the design of semiconductor devices and packaging than             
              those which are currently available.
