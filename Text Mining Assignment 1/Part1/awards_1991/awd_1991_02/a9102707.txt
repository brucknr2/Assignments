Abstract    :
              The quantum mechanical tunneling of the total magnetization of                 
              small magnetic particles of size 100A will be studied                          
              theoretically.  The proposed work focuses on dissipative couplings             
              such as that between different grains in a geometry  involving many            
              particles, to spin waves in a single particle, and to conduction               
              electrons in metallic particles.  The calculations will be extended            
              to finite temperature, and realistic crystal anisotropy energies               
              beyond the leading order forms dictated by symmetry.  A combination            
              of path integral and perturbative methods will be used, involving              
              both numerical and analytical methods.
