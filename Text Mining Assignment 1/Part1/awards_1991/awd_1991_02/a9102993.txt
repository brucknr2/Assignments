Abstract    :
                   This research will focus on an approach to automating the                 
              arrangement and subsequent drawing of the classical plant layout               
              problem.  New factors are included that are not addressed in basic             
              approaches such as Computerized Resource Allocation of Facilities              
              Technique (CRAFT).  These factors are fixed department shapes that             
              can be unequal in size, location dependent construction cost, and              
              location constraints for a subset of departments.                              
                   The approach is based on recent developments in plant layout,             
              namely, simulated annealing, cluster analysis, cut-tree                        
              representations, and network models of packing problems.  A unique             
              combination of these approaches will be studied in connection with             
              a branch and bound approach to solve this problem with a high                  
              probability of finding the optimum.  The approach will also                    
              highlight changes in requirements that will render an infeasible               
              problem feasible.  Subjective considerations from current                      
              approaches are removed with algorithmic approaches such as the                 
              assignment algorithm.  The solution system will allow an attack on             
              plant space reallocation and department relocation because of the              
              feasibility feature and constraint feature.
