Abstract    :
                   This grants supports the comprehensive data base of lower                 
              thermospheric measurements of winds, temperatures, densities, and              
              composition from satellites, rockets, and ground-based radar and               
              optical instruments.  These data will be used to develop and test              
              an empirical model of global lower thermospheric diurnal and                   
              semidiurnal tidal oscillations from 85 to 150 km.  Analysis of                 
              the data set will include formation of climatological averages at              
              different geographic locations based on solar cycle and                        
              geomagnetic activity where appropriate.  Fourier decomposition of              
              the climatological averages will yield diurnal and semidiurnal                 
              components at selected altitudes, and finally decomposition of                 
              the Fourier component as a function of latitude will allow                     
              amplitudes, and phase of the contributing Hough function tidal                 
              modes to be determined.  Climatological averages and model Hough               
              function amplitudes and phases will be assembled in convenient                 
              format for distribution to interested scientists.  The resulting               
              model representations of lower thermospheric diurnal and                       
              semidiurnal tides will be used in several scientific                           
              investigations.  Climatological tidal oscillations will be                     
              compared with the results of previous theoretical and                          
              semiempirical models.  Other studies will include investigation                
              of the electrodynamic forcing of the ionosphere arising from the               
              deduced global lower-thermosphere tides and a term analysis of                 
              the tidal momentum forcing in the lower thermosphere utilizing                 
              the National Center for Atmosphere Research (NCAR) Thermosphere                
              Ionosphere General Circulation Model (TIGCM) and its diagnostic                
              processors.  ***
