Abstract    :
              We request the circular dichroism spectrometer 62DS of Aviv                    
              Associates, equipped with a sample temperature regulator, a stopped            
              flow sample mixing system and light scattering correction system.              
              The major users of this instrument are faculty at the University               
              of Minnesota (Twin Cities Campus) in the departments of                        
              Biochemistry and Chemistry.  The primary research interests of this            
              group of faculty are protein and peptide structure, ligand binding             
              and dynamics.  A reliable CD spectrometer is essential to all of               
              the major users.  This instrument will be important in training                
              postdoctoral, graduate, and undergraduate students in the labs of              
              the major users.  In addition, it will be used in training minority            
              students at the undergraduate and high school level who participate            
              in the various laboratory research programs of the home                        
              administrative unit of the major users, the College of Biological              
              Sciences.
