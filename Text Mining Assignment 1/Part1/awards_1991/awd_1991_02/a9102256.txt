Abstract    :
              Dr. David Jonas has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research                       
              Fellowship in Chemistry.  Dr. Jonas' doctoral degree was from                  
              the Massachusetts Institute of Technology under the supervision                
              of Professor Robert Field. Dr. Jonas intends to continue                       
              research at the University of Chicago under the supervision of                 
              Professor Graham Fleming. Dr. Jonas' postdoctoral research will                
              deal with phase coherence and quantum interference effects in                  
              liquids. Longer term, he plans to study coherence and optical                  
              activity of chiral molecules.                                                  
              %%%                                                                            
              The Postdoctoral Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as                 
              an important infrastructural program designed to broaden the                   
              knowledge and experience of new Ph.D.s and attract them into                   
              meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research and                       
              teaching.
