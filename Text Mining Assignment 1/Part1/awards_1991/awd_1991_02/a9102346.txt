Abstract    :
              Perturbation Analysis (PA) and more particularly                               
              Infinitesimal PA (IPA) has been developed as a                                 
              response to real world problems.  Simple IPA calculates                        
              a derivative estimate using the holding time sequence                          
              under the deterministic similarity assumption that the                         
              state part of the trajectory sequence is invariant under                       
              perturbation.  This is always violated in the limit of an                      
              infinitely long sample path or an infinitely large                             
              ensemble of finite sample path.  The objective of the                          
              research is to investigate the following topics:                               
              (1) Generalized cut and paste method for IPA analysis,                         
              (2) IPA with bias correction and smoothed PA,                                  
              (3) A-segment methodology and variance reduction,                              
              (4) fine tune the software performance of real time                            
              computing using PA analysis.
