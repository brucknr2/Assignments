Abstract    :
                   The area of research of this project is set theory, in                    
              particular, large cardinals and forcing.  Set theory may be                    
              viewed as containing mathematics, that is, every theorem of                    
              classical mathematics may be formulated as a statement about                   
              sets, and then formally derived from the standard collection ZFC               
              of axioms for set theory.  Beginning with the work of Godel                    
              (1936) and Cohen (1963), set theorists have shown that problems                
              on which mathematicians have worked are independent, i.e. neither              
              provable nor disprovable from ZFC.  The first and most well-known              
              example of this is the Godel-Cohen result that Cantor's continuum              
              hypothesis is independent.  Some statements independent of ZFC                 
              are nevertheless known to be provable when ZFC is augmented by                 
              axioms asserting the existence of large infinite cardinal                      
              numbers.  The project has three parts:  first, to continue                     
              the study of a class of very large cardinals; second, to continue              
              the study of the relation of these cardinals to problems in                    
              finite combinatorics; and third, to study some unrelated topics.               
                  While the details of proofs in this area are mainly meant                  
              for experts, it is a remarkably intriguing discovery that some                 
              very basic mathematical propositions not only have not yet been                
              proved or disproved, but can be proved to be unprovable (or                    
              disprovable).
