Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              Study will be made of dimethyl sulfide distribution in seawater                
              and overlying air masses with de novo production of reduced                    
              sulfur compounds from sulfate.  Incorporation of radioactive                   
              sulfate into reduced (protein and metabolites) and non-reduced                 
              (sulfolipids and sulfate esters) components of microplankton                   
              will be measured as a function of light field and depth over                   
              the naturally occurring day/night cycle.  Additional                           
              measurements of radioactive bicarbonate incorporation into                     
              cellular constituents will be made in a similar manner to                      
              determine (a) the proportion of reductive sulfate assimilation                 
              attributable to phytoplankton and (b) the applicability of                     
              carbon-based productivity measurements to phytoplankton sulfate                
              reduction and hence potential volatile sulfur compound release.                
              Estimates will be made of areal production for comparison with                 
              dimethyl sulfide flux estimates.
