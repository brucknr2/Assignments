Abstract    :
              This proposal requests funds to permit Dr. Bernard Gordon,                     
              Department of  Polymer Science, Pennsylvania State University,                 
              to pursue with Dr. Seng Neon Gan, Department of Chemistry,                     
              University of Malaya, macromer synthesis via delocalized                       
              carbanions.  Their research  will involve (1) preparing new                    
              macromers (polymers with a reactive terminal) by anionic                       
              initiation, (2) chemically modifying hydrogenated rubbers to                   
              produce elastic fragments with reactive terminals, and (3)                     
              investigating the reactions of epoxidized natural rubber with                  
              various macromers and polymers prepared by anionic initiation.                 
                                                                                             
              Diversification of the traditional uses of natural and                         
              synthetic rubbers  can be achieved by changing the properties                  
              of the base polymers.  This can be done by direct chemical                     
              reactions to change the structures or by grafting other                        
              polymers onto the rubber structure.  This project adds an                      
              international cooperative dimension to the PI's research                       
              under NSF Grant  No. DMR-8822938.  Dr. Gan's experience with                   
              natural and synthetic  rubbers and prior collaboration with                    
              the PI on macromers will add a valuable new dimension to the                   
              ongoing research.  This project is relevant to the objectives                  
              of the Science in Developing Countries Program which seeks to                  
              increase the level of cooperation between U.S. and developing                  
              country scientists and engineers through the exchange of                       
              scientific information, ideas, skills, and techniques and                      
              through collaboration on problems of mutual benefit.
