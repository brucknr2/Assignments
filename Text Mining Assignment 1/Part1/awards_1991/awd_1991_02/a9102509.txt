Abstract    :
              This research is on the test and diagnostic tools for bridging and             
              leakage faults, and to build a comprehensive fault model for these             
              faults.  The approach is to utilize current monitoring techniques,             
              which provide better observability than present response                       
              generators.  This technique is being used to develop simpler, more             
              efficient, more effective algorithms which will form the basis for             
              a new set of test tools.  Algorithms for computing test strings for            
              partial scan, test generators for built-in-self-test, fault                    
              simulation, and diagnostic tools are being explored.  The impact               
              of these algorithms on circuit design is also being explored                   
              through the building of tools based on the algorithms
