Abstract    :
              This award will support Professor Arthur D. Murphy of Georgia                  
              State University in a research collaboration with Professor                    
              Miguel A. Mendez Rosado of the Instituto Tecnologico de Oaxaca in              
              Oaxaca City, Mexico.  The purpose of the research is to carry out              
              a comprehensive study of water quality and management in Oaxaca.               
              Microbiological studies of water quality and ethnographic studies              
              of attitudes toward water quality and management before and after              
              the rainy season will allow the project to relate water-borne                  
              illness to both water quality and household water management                   
              practices.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              Poor quality drinking water is a major cause of death and illness              
              in Mexico and in other developing countries.  The incidence of                 
              gastrointestinal and other water-borne illnesses in human                      
              populations is the result of the interaction between the                       
              potability of the available water and how that water is handled                
              by the consuming household.  By shedding light on the attitudes                
              toward water and its management at the household level, this                   
              joint study will help health authorities design educational and                
              intervention programs to improve water potability, while, at the               
              same time, serve as a useful model in the field of urban                       
              planning.
