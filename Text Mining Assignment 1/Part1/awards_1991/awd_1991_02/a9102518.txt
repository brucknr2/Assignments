Abstract    :
                   This research project consists of two main parts, concerning              
              (1) the topology of real algebraic sets, and (2) the topology of               
              smooth 4-manifolds.  The first part will build on the                          
              investigator's success (together with Henry King of the                        
              University of Maryland) in settling an old conjecture of John                  
              Nash.  The second part will focus on the construction of fake                  
              smooth structures on 4-manifolds, particularly their detection by              
              means of such new invariants as Floer homology and the still                   
              newer invariants of Turaev-Reshetikhin-Witten coming from quantum              
              groups.                                                                        
                   Both parts of this project concern themselves with very                   
              natural objects which are ubiquitous in mathematics and                        
              mathematical physics.  Four-manifolds are cosmologically                       
              important, since we live in a manifold of three space dimensions               
              plus one time dimension.
