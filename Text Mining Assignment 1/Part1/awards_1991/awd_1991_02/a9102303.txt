Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This development project will provide a CCD-based x-ray area                   
              detector system for collecting and processing diffraction data                 
              form protein crystals and other macromolecular assemblies using                
              laboratory x-ray sources.  The detector will have a 115 mm-                    
              diameter active area, 1024X 1024 resolution elements, a dynamic                
              range of 4000, a DQE of up to 0.6, and a readout time of <6                    
              seconds.  The system will be a fully-tested, integrated data-                  
              collection package, and include the detector, a UNIX-based                     
              workstation, software, a goniometer, and documentation.  The                   
              performance, cost, availability and reliability of each component              
              will be considered n the design, so that the system can be widely              
              distributed.  The individual components will be thoroughly                     
              characterized, and the complete system tested extensively by                   
              collecting data from a variety of protein crystals.  This                      
              integrated system will be ready for use, without need for further              
              hardware or software development.
