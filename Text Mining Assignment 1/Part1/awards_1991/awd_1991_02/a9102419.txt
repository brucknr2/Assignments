Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The goal of this project is the development of new miniature                   
              radio frequency coils that will extend the application of NMR                  
              microscopy to smaller fields of view than have previously been                 
              studied.  We propose to develop new coils with diameters as small              
              as 10 um, which would be two orders of magnitude smaller than                  
              those presently used.  At these dimensions, traditional circuit                
              models used to characterize the interaction between the coil and               
              the sample are inadequate.  Therefore, we propose to conduct a                 
              more complete theoretical analysis and experimental validation of              
              coil performance.  This evaluation will include 1) design and                  
              fabrication of new coil configurations, 2) electrical                          
              characterization of coil parameters (resistance, inductance,                   
              quality factor), and 3) verification of coil performance (signal-              
              to-noise, image resolution) at 300 MHz.  The results of this                   
              study will be new microdomain coils with enhanced sensitivity for              
              small imaging volumes and improved signal-to-noise.
