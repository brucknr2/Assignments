Abstract    :
               This award provides funds to aid in the purchase of several                   
              items of modern research equipment, including a DNA                            
              synthesizer, confocal microscope and a computer workstation                    
              for molecular graphics applications.  The group of                             
              researchers who will benefit from the equipment have diverse                   
              research programs in biochemistry and in developmental and                     
              cellular biology.  These include studies of gene structure                     
              and regulation, and the movement of organelles and cells                       
              during development of both plants and animals.  The                            
              equipment provided is typical of advanced equipment                            
              developed during the last few years and now essential to                       
              research in most areas of modern biology.
