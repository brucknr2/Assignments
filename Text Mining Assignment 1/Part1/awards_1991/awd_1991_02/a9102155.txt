Abstract    :
              Many useful thin-walled structures such as aircraft and automatic              
              parts, rocket casings, helicopter blades, and a variety of                     
              containment vessels, are constructed of layers of anisotropic,                 
              filament or fiber-reinforced materials.  While many of these                   
              structures are subject to severe mechanical, inertial, or thermal              
              loads, they must often be designed to remain elastic.  This means              
              that it is particularly important to be able to compute accurately             
              global characteristics, such as buckling loads and natural                     
              frequencies, as well as local information such as stresses near                
              holes or edges.  It is proposed to study two important,                        
              complementary regions of such structures, namely, the interior                 
              where there are no steep stress gradients, and the edge zone(s)                
              where stress gradients are high.  For both regions, simplified,                
              cost-effective asymptotic methods will be developed.  The scope of             
              the investigation will include both linear and nonlinear problems.             
              It is known that considerations of nonlinear effects in composites             
              often lead to striking differences from predictions of linearized              
              theories.  In view of the rapid utilization of advanced composite              
              materials in current technology, studies on large deformations of              
              such materials promise to have widespread impact on the knowledge              
              and technology base.
