Abstract    :
              This applicant proposes to study regulation of DNA replication                 
              and transcription in eukaryotic cells.  More specifically, the                 
              work will employ biochemistry and molecular biology techniques to              
              focus on the effects of the phosphoprotein p53 on the replication              
              and transcription processes.   The work is planned to take place               
              in the laboratory of Dr. Carol Prives at Columbia University.
