Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A summer school on equatorial physics emphasizing the role of                  
              tracers will be held during June, 1991 at URI.  This will be                   
              focused on, but not limited to, participants in the JGOFS and                  
              TOGA programs.  A major goal is to familiarize investigators who               
              do not appreciate the unique dynamics near the equator.
