Abstract    :
              The research is directed at developing immunoassay diagnostics                 
              for potential field-kit use that would more easily determine the               
              ripening of pome fruit (e.g. fruit with internal seeds).  The                  
              focus will be on developing enzyme-linked immuno system assays                 
              (ELISA's) which are specific and highly sensitive in detecting                 
              proteins associated with ripening.  During Phase I polyclonal                  
              antibodies were produced against malic enzyme and post-initiation              
              protein pAp5 and crude ELISA's were developed.  In Phase II                    
              monoclonal antibodies will be produced to improve their                        
              specificity and sensitivity.  Prototypes will be developed and                 
              validated.  These ELISAs will be used to quantitate changes in                 
              specific proteins that occur in synchrony with or just prior to                
              the onset of the ripening process.  Efficacy tests will be                     
              performed with fruits from experimental controlled atmosphere                  
              (CA) storage which maintains fruits in the preclimacteric                      
              condition.  Gene expression of these proteins also will be                     
              investigated by Michigan State University scientists.  the                     
              diagnostics developed could have major economic benefits for                   
              fruit growers by minimizing losses incurred too early or too late              
              picking of fruit.
