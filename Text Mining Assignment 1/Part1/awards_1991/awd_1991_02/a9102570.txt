Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Belmont College is establishing a connection to NSFNET via a                   
              56,000 bits per second line to Vanderbilt University, which                    
              connects to the SURANET mid-level network.  The connection                     
              enhances collaborations of campus scientists with colleagues at                
              other institutions, and allows access to libraries and other                   
              remote facilities throughout the internet.  This award funds part              
              of the costs for two years.//
