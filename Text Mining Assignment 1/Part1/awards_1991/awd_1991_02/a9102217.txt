Abstract    :
                   In previous work, Dr. Heck and collaborators assessed the                 
              importance of short-term grazing by sea urchins, and bioturbation              
              by sand dollars in a seagrass habitat in the northern Gulf.                    
              Based on results of this effort and newly published information,               
              they will now initiate additional field experiments in the                     
              northern Gulf of Mexico, as well as studies at a south Florida                 
              site, to identify more precisely the densities of sea urchins and              
              the duration of herbivory required to permanently create                       
              unvegetated sand flats.  Together these two sites represents the               
              northern and southern extents of some of the most extensive                    
              seagrass habitats in the United States, encompassing some 14,000               
              Km2.  Additionally, they will continue assessing the role of                   
              bioturbation of the seagrass rhizosphere by sand dollars, and the              
              potential interaction between sand dollar bioturbation and sea                 
              urchin herbivory in limiting the distribution of seagrass                      
              habitats.  They will carry out the first experimental                          
              examination of the ability of stringrays and burrowing crabs to                
              create and maintain unvegetated sand flats within otherwise                    
              suitable habitat for seagrasses.                                               
                   The work will improve our understanding of the variables                  
              involved in maintaining habitat and mosaics, and those that                    
              facilitate changes between alternative community states (e.g.                  
              seagrass meadows and sand flats) which in turn can lead to                     
              drastic shifts in primary and secondary productivity.
