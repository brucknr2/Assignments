Abstract    :
              This project is a cooperative effort to measure transport and                  
              water mass characteristics of the Benguela Current at 30|S in the              
              eastern Atlantic.  A section of Inverted Echo Sounders (IES) and               
              current meters along 30|S will be complemented by three IES's at               
              39|S.  CTD surveys will be carried out along and between the                   
              sections.  Objectives are to monitor transport and source waters               
              of the Benguela in relation to variability in the Agulhas                      
              Retroflection region.  Data will be combined with similar data                 
              from the western side of the subtropical gyre, collected by German             
              investigators, in order to address the total meridional transport              
              across 30|S.  Although not part of the official US WOCE program,               
              results will contribute to WOCE activity in the South Atlantic.
