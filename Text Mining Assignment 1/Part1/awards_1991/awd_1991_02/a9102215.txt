Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Many animal and plant cells are exposed to environmental salinity              
              changes which cause alterations in the normal volumes of these                 
              cells.  These changes, if they remained uncorrected, would disturb             
              or even destroy normal cell function.  Therefore, cells have                   
              evolved mechanisms by which they can adjust their volumes following            
              these disturbances.  During the past decade we have been                       
              investigating the mechanisms of volume regulation in one type of               
              cell.                                                                          
                                                                                             
              We found that the red blood cell (RBC) of the salinity-tolerant                
              little skate is a good model in which to study cell volume                     
              regulation.  During the upcoming grant period we plan to determine             
              how transport proteins in the cell's membrane operate to reduce                
              cell volume after volume expansion in a dilute medium.  This will              
              involve identifying the specific membrane proteins involved in the             
              process and the "signaling" mechanisms that "tell" the proteins                
              that cell volume is too large, thereby activating these proteins.              
                                                                                             
              The results obtained in this study will be important to our                    
              understanding of the basic principles of cell volume regulation.               
              In addition they will assist in discovering the causes of                      
              disturbances, as well as development of new treatments for diseases            
              affecting the body's ability to maintain normal cell volume.
