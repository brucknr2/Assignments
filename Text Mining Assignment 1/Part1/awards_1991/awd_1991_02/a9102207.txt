Abstract    :
              A circular dichroism spectrometer having far-ultraviolet                       
              capabilities will be purchased as a shared instrument for                      
              research in biochemistry, organic chemistry and inorganic                      
              chemistry.  The spectrometer will be located in the Department of              
              Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of Maryland                       
              Baltimore County campus and will be shared among six major users,              
              and three minor users.  Of the major users, five will be at UMBC               
              and one will be at the University of Maryland Medical School                   
              Department of Biological Chemistry.  The proposed instrument will              
              serve primarily the needs of the UMBC campus which does not now                
              have a suitable instrument for most of this research.  The                     
              research projects will be in peptide and protein chemistry,                    
              biochemistry of complex carbohydrates, synthetic nucleotides,                  
              nucleic acid chemistry and in metaloprotein chemistry.
