Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              COSEPUP proposal for core support, Oct. 3, 1990                                
                                                                                             
              This two year award to the Committee on Science, Engineering,                  
              and Public Policy (COSEPUP) would support the Committee's core                 
              functions in performing a wide range of studies on major                       
              issues in science and technology policy by calling together                    
              panels of experts.  Membership of COSEPUP and of its panels                    
              is of the highest quality.  The proposal is the third of                       
              multi-year requests from COSEPUP to the National Science                       
              Foundation.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              COSEPUP has served for thirty years as a source of high level                  
              advice to science advisors and other senior government officials.              
              The current proposal describes the intention of the Committee to               
              continue to perform S&T policy studies at the broadest levels of               
              analysis.  While predicting which issues will be taken up by                   
              COSEPUP are difficult to predict, the following are offered as                 
              candidates:  conflict of interest, science advice, government                  
              decision-making for research, technology and trade policy, and                 
              technology transfer and world security.  COSEPUP studies make                  
              important contributions to the understanding of major S&T policy               
              issues, including issues of central concern to NSF.  This award                
              will allow COSEPUP to continue this work.
