Abstract    :
              A core Facility for intensive computer and molecular graphics is               
              proposed for the recently expanded research initiative in                      
              Molecular Biophysics at Washington University School of Medicine.              
              This expansion during the past two years had included:  (a)                    
              recruitment of six new faculty whose research is on molecular                  
              biophysics of proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids, (b)                         
              construction of new faculty research laboratories, a new NMR                   
              facility and an x-ray structure facility.                                      
                                                                                             
              The requested instrumentation is a cluster of minisupercomputer                
              workstations and associated peripherals that will provide optimum              
              cost/performance characteristics for both the compute-intensive                
              and molecular graphics needs of the biophysics group comprised of              
              the new and previously-present faculty plus one or two additional              
              projected recruitments (8-10 laboratories total).  Research                    
              projects that will be critically dependent on the new                          
              Computational Core facility include:  (a) crystallographic                     
              refinement on a number of protein structures being solved with                 
              use of the current Xuong-Hamlin area detector, (b) distance                    
              geometry and simulated annealing analysis of NMR data for                      
              protein, nucleic acid and lipid system, (c) computational                      
              modeling of structural and thermodynamic properties of proteins                
              and the development of improved macromolecular potential energy                
              functions, and (d) modeling and analysis of the dynamics,                      
              energetics and linkages in large systems of macromolecules,                    
              including blood-clotting cascades, protein-DNA complexes and                   
              cytoskeletal systems.
