Abstract    :
                   Abrasive Flow Machining is a finishing process utilized in                
              several vital industrial segments, for finish-machining of                     
              manufactured components. This work will develop, as a first phase,             
              the qualitative and quantitative relationships between process                 
              parameters such as media viscosity, extrusion pressure, flow volume            
              and number of cycles. This will be accomplished through                        
              experimental work and stochastic modelling, since the process is               
              random in nature. Based on the established relationships, an off-              
              line optimization scheme will be developed and tested. An on-line              
              monitoring and computer based control system will be implemented               
              to improve the performance and efficiency of the process.                      
                   In the area of Abrasive Flow Machining, the United States                 
              stills holds a lead both in technology and applications. This work             
              will assist in maintaining this lead while strengthening the                   
              technological base of the domestic industry. Through improvements              
              in process efficiency and process capability, this work will also              
              broaden the application base of this technique, with economic                  
              benefits to a  wide spectrum of manufacturing industries.
