Abstract    :
                   The objective of this activity is the development of a                    
              theoretical and empirical understanding of the ionospheric                     
              thermospheric domain in the 100-1000 km altitude region. To                    
              accomplish this objective it is proposed to continue SUNDIAL                   
              investigations focused on global scale ionospheric physics, its                
              solar and interplanetary controls, and its coupling to the                     
              magnetosphere and thermosphere,  SUNDIAL investigations merge the              
              accumulated ionospheric, magnetospheric interplanetary and solar               
              inputs, and will use the combined data to test first- principle                
              and empherical models dealing with measurements and " in situ"                 
              observations from relevant satellite programs of opportunity                   
              through ground based activity.  The data and models will be                    
              reviewed and analyzed in workshops.  Special issue journal                     
              publications will be  developed.  The data base will archived                  
              for follow-on investigations and baseline support for efforts to               
              develop a geospace prediction capability.  ***
