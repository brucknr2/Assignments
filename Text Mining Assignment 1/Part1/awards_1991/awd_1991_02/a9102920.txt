Abstract    :
                   This project will consider invariants and normal forms of                 
              control systems under feedback, observability transformations,                 
              and dynamic feedback.  These topics will be investigated using                 
              the method of equivalence, exterior differential systems, and the              
              theory of infinite pseudogroups.  Major improvements of the exact              
              linearization of Brunovsky's normal form are expected.                         
                   This project has immediate applications to nonlinear                      
              autopilot design as well as other industrial processes; increase               
              in computational speed will hopefully overcome flight problems of              
              aircraft like the Harrier.
