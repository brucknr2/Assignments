Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Foreign policy decisions are influenced to a considerable extent               
              by the nature of the information available to the decision maker               
              and by the way that information is analyzed and processed.  A long             
              tradition of previous research demonstrates that the way decisions             
              makers perceive and respond to information depends significantly               
              on their prior beliefs.  To date, however, the complexity of these             
              beliefs has made them very difficult to study systematically using             
              standard empirical methods.  This project uses computational                   
              modeling techniques, including expert system technology, to more               
              systematically examine the impact of complex belief systems on the             
              processing of foreign policy information.                                      
                                                                                             
              Specifically, this research continues development of a large expert            
              system model, called POLI, of U.S. foreign policy making in Asia.              
              Prior work with this model has focussed on the 1950s and has proven            
              highly successful in reproducing U.S. responses to Asia during that            
              decade.  This project will attempt to validate and refine the model            
              by extending its analysis of foreign policy in Asia from 1960                  
              through the present.                                                           
                                                                                             
              When completed this project not only should provide a better                   
              understanding of the processes through which U.S. foreign policy               
              is made but should provide a powerful tool that can be used by                 
              policy makers to improve decision making.
