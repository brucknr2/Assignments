Abstract    :
              Dr. Pamela Chu has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research                        
              Fellowship in Chemistry.  Dr. Chu's doctoral degree was from                   
              the University of California at Berkeley under the supervision                 
              of Professor Yuan Lee. Dr. Chu intends to continue research at                 
              the National Institute of Standards and Technology under the                   
              sponsorship of Dr. Richard Cavanagh. Dr. Chu's area of                         
              postdoctoral research will be the photoexcitation and                          
              fragmentation/desorption mechanisms of metal carbonyls on metal                
              and semiconductor substrates. Longer term, she plans to study                  
              laser-induced photochemistry at surfaces and surface-mediated                  
              reactions probed by two-photon photoemission.

              The Postdoctoral Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as                 
              an important infrastructural program designed to broaden the                   
              knowledge and experience of new Ph.D.s and attract them into                   
              meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research and                       
              teaching.
