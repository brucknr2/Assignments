Abstract    :
              It will primarily be used in research projects that center on the              
              general question of how genes control development.  The ability                
              to take optical sections and eliminate out of focus fluorescence               
              makes the confocal microscope particularly valuable for use in                 
              experiments where thick specimens are examined.  The proposed                  
              research, which largely involves localizing proteins and                       
              analyzing cellular and subcellular of thick specimens, thus it                 
              should be markedly enhanced by the use of a CLSM.
