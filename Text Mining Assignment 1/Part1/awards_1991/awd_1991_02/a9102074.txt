Abstract    :
              This applicant proposes to study the receptor for Neurite-                     
              Extension-Factor/S100B, a glial protein which stimulates neuronal              
              differentiation.  Specifically, he hopes to identify, purify,                  
              characterize and perhaps clone the receptor for this growth                    
              factor.  If progress permits, the applicant also hopes to work on              
              the signal transduction mechanism by which the growth factor                   
              exerts its effect.  This work is planned to take place int he                  
              laboratory of Dr. Daniel Marshak at the Cold Spring Harbor                     
              laboratory.
