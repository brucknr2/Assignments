Abstract    :
              This award will provide supplementary support to enable Dr.                    
              Robert Close of the University of California, Los Angeles, to                  
              conduct collaborative research with Dr. Shinichi Tamura for                    
              12 months at the Biomedical Research Center, Osaka University                  
              Medical School, in Japan.  In order to develop a technique to                  
              measure vascular autoregulatory response by combining digital                  
              subtraction angiography (DSA) data with pressure measurements,                 
              the collaborative project will utilize several novel algorithms                
              for extraction of vascular volume, flow, and perfusion                         
              diameters which were developed by Dr. Close.                                   
                                                                                             
              The vascular autoregulatory response may be measured by                        
              relating variations in diameter and flow rates of a blood                      
              vessel with pressure variations.  Dr. Tamura is an expert in                   
              the field of DSA and the Osaka University Hospital is                          
              developing a new picture archival and communications system                    
              (PACS) for handling digital images and radiological data.                      
              Utilizing DSA images, digital algorithms  developed by Dr.                     
              Close will be used to measure vessel size and flow rate.                       
              Measurement of the vascular autoregulatory response may be                     
              clinically useful as an indicator of atherosclerosis or in                     
              evaluating the effects of arteriovenous malformations.
