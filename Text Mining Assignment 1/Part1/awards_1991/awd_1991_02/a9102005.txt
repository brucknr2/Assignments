Abstract    :
              Japan JSPS Program:  "Sidescan Sonar and Multichannel Seismic                  
              Investigations of the Northern Izu-Bonin Arc-Trench System"                    
                                                                                             
              This award will provide supplementary support to enable Dr.                    
              Adam Klaus of the University of Hawaii to conduct collaborative                
              research with Dr. Asahiko Taira for 12 months at the Ocean                     
              Research Institute, University of Tokyo in Japan.  After                       
              collecting sidescan sonar and multichannel seismic data, they                  
              will test Dr. Klaus' hypotheses on the structural and volcanic                 
              processes of intra-oceanic island arc rifting and the forearc                  
              sedimentation processes and submarine canyon formation.                        
                                                                                             
              The Izu-Bonin Arc-Trench is one of only a few places in the                    
              world where active rifting of intra-oceanic island arcs                        
              presently occurs.  The University of Hawaii has already                        
              collected data from various sections of the system, but the                    
              data is not complete.  Complimenting the University of                         
              Hawaii's data, Dr. Taira began a data acquisition program for                  
              the Izu-Bonin Arc-Trench System in 1991.  The data collected                   
              using Ocean Research Institute's state-of-the-art swath-mapping                
              and multichannel seismic data acquisition systems, when                        
              combined with existing data, will provide the necessary data                   
              to test Klaus' hypotheses and refine his models of the                         
              structural evolution of backarc rifts and the tectonic                         
              control of forearc sedimentation and submarine canyon                          
              evolution.
