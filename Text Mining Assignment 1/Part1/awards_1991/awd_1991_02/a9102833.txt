Abstract    :
              Maturation of most eukaryotic mRNAs involves RNA splcing.                      
              Therefore, understanding of mechanism of RNA splcing is central to             
              understanding gene expression.  Maturation of some mRNAs in C.                 
              elegans (involves the acquisition of one of two spliced leaders                
              through tran-splcing.  The two spliced leaders are specifically                
              trans-spliced to different mRNAs and the reaction is very specific.            
              Therefore, understanding the mechanism of trans-splicing is central            
              to understanding gene expression in C. elegans.  The working                   
              hypothesis of this proposal can be stated as follows:  There are               
              different classes of trans-spliceosomes in C. elegans with the                 
              difference being the presence of SL1 snRNP or SL2 snRNP.  In                   
              addition, trans-splicing and cis-splicing in C. elegans occur on               
              separate classes of spliceosomes.  The difference between these                
              classes is the presence of SL snRNP in trans-spliceosomes and U1               
              snRNP in cis-spliceosomes.  Other snRNPs are common to both classes            
              of spliceosomes.                                                               
                                                                                             
              Using a molecular genetic approach,  the PI will investigate two               
              key questions concerning the mechanism of RNA splicing in C.                   
              elegans.  What nucleotides of SL RNAs are important in determing               
              specificity during trans-splicing and is trans-splicing independent            
              of U1 of snRNP?
