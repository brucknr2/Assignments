Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              During the developmental process nerve cells, like other cells in              
              the mammalian system, ultimately die.  Embryonic nerve cells                   
              which are induced to undergo developmental death, express a gene               
              which has shown to regulate developmental neuronal death in the                
              invertebrate, c. elegans.  The cell death gene has been                        
              identified as ced4.  This research project will examine the                    
              mechanisms that regulate expressions of the cell death gene in                 
              the nervous system. n Dr. Weill will extend the studies by                     
              cloning the mammalian homolog for ced4, which will enable Dr.                  
              Weill to identify the proteins associated with neuronal death.                 
              Molecular techniques will be utilized to clone for the mouse ced4              
              gene.  Results from this study will provide a better                           
              understanding of how cell death is regulated, and the role the                 
              cell death gene performs in normal and abnormal development and                
              tissue function.
