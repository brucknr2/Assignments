Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will study the behavior of                     
              singularities arising in harmonic maps, minimal surfaces, and                  
              certain problems in mechanics. The questions to be considered                  
              include the possibility of prescribing the location of                         
              singularities and their behavior as well as questions on the                   
              structure of spaces of harmonic maps with singularities. Specific              
              investigations will focus on liquid crystals, ferromagnetics,                  
              p-harmonic maps, and geodesics in varieties.                                   
                   Many functions, mappings, and spaces arising in models of our             
              physical surroundings involve singularities. Two of the most                   
              familiar settings in which the study of singularities plays an                 
              important role are liquid crystal and minimal surfaces. Liquid                 
              crystals are commonly used to display characters in digital watches            
              and laptop computer screens. Minimal surfaces are those surfaces               
              which span a closed curve and have smallest area. A physical                   
              example is a soap bubble which spans a wire loop. By introducing               
              twists in the loop, one may easily produce a soap bubble with                  
              singularities. The principal investigator will study these                     
              singularities  using techniques from geometric measure theory. A               
              major aspect of the work is to develop general techniques which can            
              then be applied to a wide range of problems.
