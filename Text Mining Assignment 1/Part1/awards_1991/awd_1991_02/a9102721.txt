Abstract    :
              Levitan         This research is on verifying timing specifications for 
              interconnection of modules in both synchronous and asynchronous  digital
              systems.  The notion of temporal behavior is being  abstracted from the notion
              of functional behavior by focusing  primarily on the control protocols of the
              modules and ignoring  the data values computed by the modules.  In this model,
              the  interface protocols of each module are given along with the  connectivity
              between modules.  A static graph is built that  describes the temporal
              relationships among all the external  signals of all the modules.  The
              verification process is based on  a comparison between the possible behaviors
              of the system,  represented by the graph, and the legal behaviors as
              represented  by a set of constraints.  The key constraint is that the temporal 
              behavior of one module cannot violate the temporal constraints of  another
              module within the system.  The algorithms support  multiple system states,
              state transitions, and checking of  conditionals and loops within the
              protocols.  This searching is  tractable because functional behavior and data
              values generated  by modules are not considered.
