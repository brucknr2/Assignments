Abstract    :
                 Professor Gutman is supported by a grant from the                           
              Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to study the kinetics                  
              and thermochemistry of elementary reactions involving                          
              polyatomic radicals of the second row elements and halogens or                 
              hydrogen halides.  Experimental techniques include the use of                  
              excimer laser photolysis to produce the free radicals under                    
              controlled conditions and time-resolved experiments to monitor                 
              reactants and products.  The radicals to be studied include                    
              halo- and perhalomethyls, oxygen containing radicals, nitrogen                 
              centered radicals and unsaturated hydrocarbon radicals. Studies                
              of reactions of  free radicals of the heavier elements,                        
              particularly radicals of silicon, phosphorus, germanium, and                   
              arsenic are of particular interest because it is likely that                   
              new chemical routes are open to radicals of these elements due                 
              to their ability to be in higher valence states than carbon.

              The objectives of this research are to gain new fundamental                    
              knowledge of the kinetics and dynamics of elementary reactions                 
              of polyatomic free radicals and to determine important                         
              thermochemical properties of these species.  The radicals to be                
              studied in this project are important to atmospheric chemistry                 
              and combustion; the halogenated radicals are relevant to our                   
              search for replacements for the ozone-destroying                               
              chlorofluorocarbons.  An exciting part of the research is the                  
              study of the chemistry of radicals of phosphorus, silicon,                     
              arsenic, and germanium which are likely to be involved in                      
              chemical vapor deposition (CVD) reactors. Chemical vapor                       
              deposition is one of the primary techniques used for growing                   
              thin films and coatings used in the semiconductor industry for                 
              the fabrication of microelectronic devices.
