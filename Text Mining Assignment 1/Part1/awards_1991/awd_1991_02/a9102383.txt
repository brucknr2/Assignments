Abstract    :
                   The project has the goal of finding a site in the vicinity                
              of Sondre Stromfjord, Greenland, for a partial reflections drifts              
              radar.  The specific costs of the site preparation required                    
              before installation of the radar will be determined, and                       
              estimates of the month-to-month operating costs will also be                   
              obtained.  In addition, the various instrumentation options will               
              be assessed.***//
