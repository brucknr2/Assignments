Abstract    :
                   This award will support the work of faculty associate Steven              
              Kalikow.  The proposed work is a mixture of probability and ergodic            
              theory.  The ergodic theory topics seek a way of expressing                    
              transformations, a way of constructing new transformations, and new            
              approaches to the question of whether mixing implies threefold                 
              mixing.  The probability topics involve a measure on stationary                
              measures, phase transition, and finding the longest common                     
              subsequence of two sequences of random variables.  The work is at              
              the interface of these two disciplines.  One application of the                
              work is in the area of DNA sequence alignment, where individuals               
              are looking for common subsequences of two DNA sequences.
