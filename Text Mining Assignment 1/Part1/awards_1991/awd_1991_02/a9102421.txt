Abstract    :
                   This project is focussed on two basic areas in the field of               
              nonlinear partial differential equations. First, the principal                 
              investigator aims to study the question of breakdown of three-                 
              dimensional incompressible and ideal fluid flow from the                       
              numerical and theoretical point of view.  Second, he plans to                  
              investigate some regularity questions for the nonlinear                        
              Klein-Gordon equation: delayed singularity formation and global                
              existence in low dimensions and breakdown of large amplitude                   
              solutions to three-dimensional semilinear equations.                           
                   These studies will accrue to the foundations of applied                   
              areas such as aerodynamics, and wave propagation.
