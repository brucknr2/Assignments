Abstract    :
              This ocean sciences instrumentation development project will                   
              design and build fiber optic sensors for continuous sensitive                  
              measurements of pCO2 in sea water.  CO2 plays a major role in                  
              the biogeochemical cycle.  Studying these complicated                          
              processes require precise quantitative measurements of small                   
              changes in CO2 in order to understand the extent of the                        
              ocean's contribution to the global CO2 cycle.                                  
                                                                                             
              The advent of optical fibers within the past decade is                         
              producing an impact on chemical sensor technology.  Optical                    
              sensors consist of reagents attached to the distal tip of an                   
              optical fiber that change their optical properties upon                        
              exposure to a specific analyte.  These sensors are small                       
              (approximately 200 microns), require no direct electrical                      
              connection between the sample and sensor, and are free from                    
              electromagnetic interference.  These characteristics make                      
              optical sensors ideal for measurements at sea.   This project                  
              aims to develop deployable instrumentation based on optical                    
              sensors for continuous sensitive pCO2 measurements in                          
              seawater.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              The project is divided into three parts.  1) Sensor/indicator                  
              development will be conducted at Tufts.  Novel indicating                      
              schemes with enhanced sensitivity and internal calibration                     
              capability will be examined.  2) Laboratory-based                              
              measurements will be conducted using both research and field                   
              portable instruments to verify the use of these indicating                     
              schemes for seawater pCO2 measurements.  This aspect of the                    
              work will be a collaborative project with Tufts and Woods                      
              Hole Oceanographic Institution.  3) Shipboard measurements of                  
              sensors for field proofing will be conducted by Woods                          
              Hole/Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institution personnel.
