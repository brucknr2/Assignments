Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will continue looking at the                   
              connection between variational models of coherent phase                        
              transitions, optimal bounds on the effective moduli of composites              
              and the relaxation of nonconvex variational problems.  In                      
              particular, he will attempt to predict the microstructure of two-              
              phase coherent phase mixtures via bulk energy minimization,                    
              evaluate the role of surface energy in determining the                         
              microstructure of coherent phase mixtures, and derive nonlinear                
              results geometrically from linear ones by means of a theory of                 
              deformations with uniformly small strain.
