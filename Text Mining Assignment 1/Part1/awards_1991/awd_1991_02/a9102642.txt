Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              Little is presently known about the conditions under which                     
              dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is produced or destroyed in                     
              modern oceans or about the role of DOC in the structure and                    
              dynamics of aquatic marine microbial ecosystems.  The objective                
              in this research is to develop a mass spectrometric method for                 
              shipboard determination of carbon-isotopic compositions of DOC                 
              and shorebased determination of carbon-isotopic compositions of                
              DOC and shorebased determination of carbon-isotopic                            
              compositions of organisms constituting the marine microbial                    
              food web.  Availability of such techniques should facilitate                   
              large-scale studies of the origin and recycling of DOC.  DOC is                
              the largest organic carbon reservoir in seawater and,                          
              accordingly, is particularly important in the global carbon                    
              cycle.  Techniques for study include light stable mass                         
              spectrometry for carbon isotopes, high-temperature catalytic                   
              combustion techniques for the determination of the abundance of                
              DOC, flow cytometry for the separation of individual cell types                
              and experimental growth of mixed bacterial populations.
