Abstract    :
                   The purpose of this research project is to develop Wilson's               
              renormalization group as a technique for proving mathematical                  
              results in statistical mechanics and quantum field theory.  In                 
              particular, these methods offer the possibility of proving results             
              (1) on the asymptotic behavior for large times of the end-to-end               
              distance of self-avoiding walks, (2) on the low temperature phase              
              and its correlations of the non-linear sigma model in more than two            
              dimensions, (3) on the construction of the non-linear sigma models             
              in two dimensions, and (4) on the absence or presence of a mass gap            
              for these models.                                                              
                   This research project is in the general area of mathematical              
              physics and, in particular, deals with research in the subareas                
              statistical mechanics and quantum field theory.
