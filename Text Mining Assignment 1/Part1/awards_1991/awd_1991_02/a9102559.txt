Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Colloids have been suggested to play critical roles in the marine              
              geochemical cycling of elements which form hydrolysis products,                
              including A1(III), Fe(III), and Th(IV).  Complexation of metals                
              by organic ligands in the colloidal size range may also be                     
              important for elements such as Cu(II) and Zn(II).  Due to their                
              function as required micro-nutrients, accurate information is                  
              needed on the speciation of Fe, Cu, and Zn (and other trace                    
              elements as well) in order to ultimately understand how this                   
              speciation is related to productivity and nutrition in the ocean.              
              The very large surface/volume ratio of colloidal hydroxides may                
              also affect the geochemistry of other particle-reactive elements.              
              Colloids in the ocean could come from multiple sources, including              
              river/estuarine transport, hydrolysis of Al and Fe released from               
              aerosols, and production of high molecular weight organic ligands              
              by marine microbes.  This work involves an initial series of                   
              experiments designed to investigate these multiple sources of                  
              colloidal material and to determine whether, and under what                    
              conditions, colloidal trace metals are a significant fraction of               
              the total "dissolved" pool of trace metals in the oceans.                      
              Samples from estuarine, coastal, and open-ocean waters will be                 
              collected using stringent anti-contamination methods and                       
              processed using cross-flow ultrafiltration (CFF).
