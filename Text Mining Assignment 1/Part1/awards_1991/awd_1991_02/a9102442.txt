Abstract    :
              With support from the Organic Dynamics Program, Dr. Turecek                    
              will investigate the preparations, stabilities, and                            
              dissociations of hypervalent oxonium, ammonium, and sulfonium                  
              radicals that are generated and analyzed via neutralization-                   
              reionization mass spectrometry. In addition, fragmentations of                 
              neutral species will be employed for the structural elucidation                
              of complex organic compounds by mass spectrometry.                             
              %%%                                                                            
              Hypervalent radicals represent a class of unstable species in                  
              which the formal valence of an atom exceeds its normal                         
              coordination number in the given oxidation state. Dissociations                
              of small hypervalent radicals often display deuterium (H-2) and                
              O-18 isotope effects of unusual magnitude; the nature of these                 
              effects is not well understood. Dr. Turecek will study                         
              hypervalent radicals in the gas phase by employing the recently                
              developed technique of neutralization reionization mass                        
              spectrometry. In the gas phase, hypervalent radicals can                       
              undergo exothermic dissociations to afford stable products.                    
              Thus, these species hold promise as a novel method by which                    
              mass spectroscopy can be used for organic structural analysis.
