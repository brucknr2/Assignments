Abstract    :
              Long and Medium-Term Research:  Study of Proton Dynamics                       
              of Petrovskite Protonic Conductors                                             
                                                                                             
              This award is under the Program for Long-& Medium Term                         
              Research at Foreign Centers of Excellence, which enables                       
              U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to twelve                       
              months of research abroad at research centers of proven                        
              excellence.  The program's awards provide opportunities                        
              for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary                     
              facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.                      
                                                                                             
              This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral                            
              research visit by Dr. Tracey Scherban of Columbia                              
              University with Dr. Michel Kleitz, Director, Laboratoire                       
              d'Ionique et d'Electrochimie du Solide de Grenoble.  The                       
              researchers plan to use techniques of quasi-elastic                            
              neutron scattering and Raman spectroscopy to characterize                      
              the protonic conductivity of the acceptor-doped perovskite                     
              oxides, KTaO3 and SrCeO3.  They will also investigate the                      
              behavior of the materials as fuel cell electrolytes and as                     
              components in electrochromic devices.                                          
                                                                                             
              The award recommendation provides funds to cover                               
              international travel, local travel abroad, and a flat                          
              administrative allowance of $250 for the U.S. home                             
              institution.
