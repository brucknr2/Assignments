Abstract    :
                   The goal of this research is to develop an approach                       
              and the necessary methodologies and tools to allow circuit card                
              assembly manufacturers to determine the optimal strategy for                   
              operating an assembly line, and to rapidly generate optimal or                 
              near-optimal line setups.  The objective is to maximize total                  
              production rate over a desired product mix.  The constraints are               
              the equipment capabilities, including material handling, the                   
              products' bills of materials, technologies, and the production                 
              plan (quantities and lot sizes required) for some planning                     
              horizon.                                                                       
                   Models and algorithms will be developed for the process                   
              optimization for a range of assembly equipment types.  These                   
              algorithms will be demonstrated using realistic data from actual               
              circuit card assembly operations.  Ultimately, these algorithms                
              should provide the basis for automated or semi-automated process               
              planning tools.  Such tools would enable process planners to                   
              create higher quality process plans, with much shorter lead times              
              than is currently possible.  The potential benefit to                          
              manufacturing is faster response to changing requirements and                  
              continuous improvement of the assembly process.
