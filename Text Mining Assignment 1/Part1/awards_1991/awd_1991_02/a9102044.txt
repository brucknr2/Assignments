Abstract    :
                   Professor Asmar's research project concerns the applications              
              of transference methods in analysis.  The emphasis is on finding               
              dimension independent bounds on the strong and weak type norms of              
              maximal operators and other singular integral operators.                       
                   The method and applications under study involve the kinds of              
              operators or functions in infinite dimensional spaces which occur              
              in the analysis of the partial differential equations of                       
              mathematical physics.  This includes, for example, the equations of            
              electromagnetism and fluid dynamics.  Knowing that these are                   
              bounded operators is often an important first step in studying                 
              solutions to these equations.
