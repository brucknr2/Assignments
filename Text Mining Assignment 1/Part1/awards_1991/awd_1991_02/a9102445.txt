Abstract    :
                   This proposal to the Upper Atmosphere Facilities program of                
                  the Atmospheric Sciences Division provides fora continuation               
                  of the baseline program of incoherent scatter radar                        
                  observations and analysis activities at the Millstone Hill                 
                  Observatory.  As this program provides the principal support               
                  for hardware systems, computers, scientific analyses, and                  
                  user support services at the Millstone Hill Observatory, a                 
                  wide range of necessary activities is proposed .  The                      
                  operational program and research plan proposed emphasize                   
                  multi-station and cooperative experiments and their                        
                  analyses.  Full participation in World Day coordinated                     
                  activities and preparation of data for the CEDAR data base                 
                  at NCAR are included.  Radar operations and analysis in                    
                  support of the CEDAR program are not funded separately by                  
                  the CEDAR program and are included in this proposal.  Basic                
                  maintenance of the Millstone Hill UHF radar and FPI optical                
                  systems for scientific programs is included as is support                  
                  for the on-site computer and data analysis facility.//
