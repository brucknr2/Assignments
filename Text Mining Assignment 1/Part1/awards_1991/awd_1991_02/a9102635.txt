Abstract    :
              This research involves two closely related approaches to debugging             
              parallel programs, pre-execution static analysis of program source             
              code and post-mortem trace analysis of an execution history.  Pre-             
              execution analysis has the advantage that all possible executions are          
              explored.  Unfortunately, in the worst case, this analysis may require         
              all possible program states to be examined resulting in unacceptable           
              complexity.  However, techniques developed at UCSC have shown that,            
              for many programs, program states can be examined in large groups              
              rather than individually.  In contrast, trace analysis algorithms              
              developed at UCSC execute in polynomial time.  They have the                   
              disadvantage that only errors associated with the input used to                
              generate the trace can be detected.  In addition to the refinement of          
              these techniques, this project will investigate the combination of a           
              single system that ameliorates the disadvantages of each technique.
