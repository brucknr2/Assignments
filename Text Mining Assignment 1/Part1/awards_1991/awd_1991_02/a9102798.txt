Abstract    :
                   The investigator will pursue research on various questions                
              concerned with topological properties of algebraic spaces.  He                 
              intends to study the topology of algebraic varieties, especially               
              invariants of families of plane algebraic curves, invariants of                
              smooth structure on algebraic varieties, and the behavior of                   
              complex polynomials near infinity.                                             
                   Relating algebraic to topological structure of spaces is a                
              source of some of the most basic and important questions in                    
              mathematics.  It calls upon a wide variety of techniques and has               
              challenged major figures in topology and algebra both here and                 
              abroad.
