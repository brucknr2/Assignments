Abstract    :
                   Professor Igusa will study the K-split irreducible pre-                   
              homogeneous vector spaces.  In particular, he wishes to complete               
              the calculations for the local zeta functions in the remaining                 
              cases.  He also intends to investigate non-standard factors of                 
              universal p-adic zeta functions.                                               
                   This project falls into the general area of arithmetic                    
              geometry -a subject that blends two of the oldest areas of                     
              mathematics: number theory and geometry.  This combination has                 
              proved extraordinarily fruitful - having recently solved problems              
              that withstood generations.  Among its many consequences are new               
              error correcting codes.  Such codes are essential for both modern              
              computers (hard disks) and compact disks.
