Abstract    :
              Dr. Daniel J. O'Leary has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research                 
              Fellowship in Chemistry.  Dr. O'Leary's doctoral degree was                    
              from UCLA under the supervision of Professor Frank Anet. Dr.                   
              O'Leary intends to continue research at Harvard University                     
              under the sponsorship of Professor Yoshito Kishi.  Dr.                         
              O'Leary's area of postdoctoral research will be synthesis and                  
              conformational behavior of C-glycosides related to palytoxin.                  
              Longer term, he plans to synthesize new macromolecular systems                 
              and analyze their conformational properties by magnetic                        
              resonance techniques.                                                          
              %%%                                                                            
              The Postdoctoral Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as                 
              an important infrastructural program designed to broaden the                   
              knowledge and experience of new Ph.D.s and attract them into                   
              meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research and                       
              teaching.
