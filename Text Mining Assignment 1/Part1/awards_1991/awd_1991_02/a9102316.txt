Abstract    :
                   Information on the convection of magnetospheric plasma is                 
              for understanding many atmospheric processes.  Although extensive              
              measurements have been made with many instruments, there remains               
              considerable disagreement about the nature of the global                       
              convection.  The purpose of this empirical model.                              
                   We will generate a database that has as its core all the                  
              convection measurements made by the radars located at Millstone                
              Hill, Goose Bay, and Sondre Stromfjord.  We will also assemble a               
              database consisting of the values od the indices that may                      
              parameterize the state of the global convection.  Several                      
              approaches to the mathematical reduction of the data to models                 
              will be explored.  An important product will be estimates of the               
              variance associated with the modeling.  By binning the                         
              observational data and studying the variances, the characteristic              
              states of the global convection will be determined and the                     
              indices of greatest parameterizing value identified.
