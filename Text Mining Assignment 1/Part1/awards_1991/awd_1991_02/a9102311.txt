Abstract    :
              The goals of this research are to empirically evaluate the                     
              effectiveness of data flow and mutation testing and to develop a new           
              methodology, named Compiler Integrated Testing, for integrating data           
              flow and mutation into a conventional compiler.  The effectiveness             
              study will be carried out using Donald Knuth's TEX program and two             
              testing tools, Mothra for mutation testing and ATAC for data flow              
              testing.  The ten year error log of TEX will serve as a data base to           
              determine the effectiveness of data flow and mutation testing.  To             
              avoid computational bottlenecks that arise in using these testing              
              methods for large programs, the CIT methodology will be integrated             
              into Mothra and ATAC for parallel execution on SIMD and MIMD machines.
