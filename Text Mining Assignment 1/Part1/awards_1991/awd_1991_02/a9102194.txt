Abstract    :
              The project will develop two high resolution tactual displays                  
              (also called dense arrays).  Each device will contain 400                      
              elements, arranged in a 20 by 20 array.  The frequency, 0 to 400               
              Hz, and amplitudes, up to 3.0 mm peak-to-peak, of the mechanical               
              vibration of each element in the array will be individually                    
              controlled.  The center-to-center spacing of the stimulator tips               
              in contact with the skin will be 0.4 mm when contacting the most               
              sensitive skin surfaces.  For less sensitive areas the spacing                 
              will be increased.  The frequency, amplitude, and spatial                      
              separation of the stimulator tips permit the dense array to match              
              or exceed the sensory capabilities of the skin.                                
                                                                                             
              Initially the dense stimulators will be used to investigate                    
              tactual spatial pattern processing.  Psychophysical studies with               
              human subjects will be conducted in conjunction with                           
              neurophysiological studies with nonhuman primates.                             
              Neurophysiological recordings will be made of first-order                      
              afferents as well as cells in primary somatosensory cortex.  By                
              appropriate selection of frequency and amplitude of stimulation,               
              spatial patterns will be generated that stimulate one or another               
              of the primary afferent systems selectively.  Spatial sensitivity              
              of and interactions between the afferent systems will be examined              
              both psychophysically and neurophysiologically.  The dense array               
              will be used to evaluate how prolonged exposure to distorted                   
              Spatial patterns affects the spatial organization of limited                   
              areas of skin.  The arrays will be used to simulate realistic                  
              tactual stimuli and to evaluate current theories of the                        
              perception of roughness and slip.  The arrays will also be used                
              to examine biomechanical responses of the skin.
