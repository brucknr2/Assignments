Abstract    :
                   The Second International Symposium on Particles, Strings                  
              and Cosmology will be held at Northeastern University.  The                    
              Symposium is interdisciplinary in nature and will cover a wide                 
              range of topics in particle physics, string theory and                         
              cosmology and their interconnections.  There will be both                      
              theoretical and experimental talks at the Symposium, and it is                 
              expected that there will be a scientifically very useful                       
              exchange of ideas.
