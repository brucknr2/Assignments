Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Funds are provided for a one year sediment trap deployment in                  
              the California Current System off southern California. Time                    
              series data on planktonic foraminifera and hydrographic                        
              measurements on plankton standing stock will be obtained to                    
              test models of foraminiferal response to spring upwelling by                   
              comparison with previously collected trap data. Ancillary                      
              objectives are to develop ecological transfer functions and                    
              reconstruct history of upwelling over the past 20 k.y.
