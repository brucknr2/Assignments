Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This electron beam writing and quantitative x-ray analysis system              
              will be used to address fundamental studies of small structures                
              having confined geometries.  Fundamental materials investigations              
              include one dimensional superconductors, magnetism in confined                 
              geometries, and reduced dimensionality.  Potential technological               
              applications are weak links, tunnel junctions, and SQUIDs. The                 
              system will be accessible to groups on the campus involved in                  
              studies of magnetism, superconductivity, and thin films.//
