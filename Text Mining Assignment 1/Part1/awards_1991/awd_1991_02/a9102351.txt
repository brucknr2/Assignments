Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Surfactant-stabilized emulsion liquid membrane process                         
              constitute a potentially important emerging separation                         
              technology for separating many toxic substances down to very                   
              low levels.  In this project, a new idea is studied, namely                    
              the use of non-Newtonian hydrocarbon membranes.  Such                          
              membranes are designed to have a dilute solution of a nonionic                 
              polymer in a low-viscosity hydrocarbon.  This polymer induces                  
              high viscosity without decreasing the diffusivity of                           
              substances through the solution.  If successfully, such                        
              membranes could lead to commercial separation processes                        
              involving liquid membranes, since less stabilizing surfactant                  
              will be needed.                                                                
                                                                                             
              A detailed experimental plan is implemented to examine the                     
              effects of polymer concentration, surfactant concentration,                    
              stirrer speed, aqueous oil rate, and other important                           
              parameters.  Separations of phenolic compounds and various                     
              metal ions are mainly studied.
