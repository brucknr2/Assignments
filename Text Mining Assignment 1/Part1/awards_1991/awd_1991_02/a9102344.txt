Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  During the first phase of this NSF sponsored Small Business               
              Innovation Research project Nonvolatile Electronics, Inc.                      
              demonstrated the potential of achieving high magnetoresistance in              
              thin iron chromium multilayers on gallium arsenide substrates (at              
              room temperature) having low magnetostriction, low required drive              
              fields, and low temperature coefficients of resistance.                        
                   Phase II research will undertake studies: (i) to create a                 
              simplified model to describe the spin valve effect in                          
              magnetoresistive materials; and (ii) to develop cobalt permalloy-              
              copper bilayers with greater than six per cent magnetoresistance               
              low magnestorestriction, low temperature coefficient of                        
              resistance, and which requires low drive fields.                               
                   It is expected the results of this research, if successful,               
              will have enormous economic impact on the magnetic recording and               
              computer industries.
