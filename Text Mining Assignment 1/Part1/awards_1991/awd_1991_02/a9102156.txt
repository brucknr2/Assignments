Abstract    :
                   This project is concerned with the theory of tree                         
              lattices and zeta functions for lattices acting on trees.                      
              The principal investigator will explore lattices in the                        
              automorphism group of a locally finite uniform tree.  The                      
              mathematical issues concern existence of lattices, volumes,                    
              commensurability classes, zeta functions, and spectral                         
              theory.                                                                        
                   A lattice is a set of objects together with an order                      
              on these objects such that any pair of objects has a                           
              greatest lower bound and a least upper bound.  Lattices have                   
              shown to be quite useful in the study of Lie groups.  In a                     
              similar spirit this project will explore lattices in the                       
              automorphism group of certain trees.  This work is of                          
              interest to many different areas of mathematics.  It also                      
              has potential applications in information theory.
