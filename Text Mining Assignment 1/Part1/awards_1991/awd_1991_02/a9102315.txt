Abstract    :
                   This proposal outlines plans to improve existing multiple                 
              etalon Fabry-Perot instruments and to evaluate carefully the                   
              application of a new interferometric technique, Spatial                        
              Heterodyne Spectroscopy, for problems within the CEDAR initiative              
              in upper atmosphere studies.  Through this effort progress will                
              be made on the important class of research projects in optical                 
              aeronomy in which extracting work signals from background noise                
              is particularly difficult.  These projects include:  1)  the                   
              study of work H-alpha emissions from the exosphere;  and 2)  the               
              study of 6300  oxygen emission in the daytime thermosphere.***//
