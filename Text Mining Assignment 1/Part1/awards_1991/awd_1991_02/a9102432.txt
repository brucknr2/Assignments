Abstract    :
                   This project is concerned with research in commutative                    
              algebra related to geometric invariant theory.  The principal                  
              investigator plans to find the equations of nilpotent orbits for               
              classical groups.  In the area of binary forms, he plans to                    
              further investigate the stratification by root multiplicities.                 
              In the area of hyperdiscriminants, he plans to describe the                    
              Whitney stratifications induced by them.                                       
                   This project involves research on the interface of                        
              commutative algebra and algebraic geometry.  Given a curve, a                  
              commutative algebra can be associated with it.  Information                    
              derived from studying the commutative algebra supplies                         
              information about the curve.  This is a rapidly developing area                
              which impacts many areas of mathematics.
