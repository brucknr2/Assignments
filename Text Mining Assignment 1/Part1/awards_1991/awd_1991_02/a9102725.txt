Abstract    :
                   At a certain basic level topology merges into set theory,                 
              which makes it a part of the foundations of mathematics.                       
                   The principal investigator will continue his research on                  
              several open questions in set-theoretic topology.  One theme is                
              normality and countable paracompactness versus paracompactness in              
              locally compact spaces.  Several longstanding problems in this area            
              remain unsettled, e.g., the Arhangel'skii-Tall problem (Are normal             
              locally compact metacompact spaces paracompact?) and Watson's                  
              problem (Is there a perfectly normal locally compact non-                      
              paracompact space in ZFC?)  Another problem has led to interesting             
              combinatorics involving ladder systems that will likely have                   
              further applications.  Other problems to be investigated include               
              the existence of Dowker filters, and questions of Watson and Cook              
              involving connectedness.  Possible methods of solution include set-            
              theoretic axioms and combinatorics, and forcing.  Solutions to the             
              problems would deepen our understanding of fundamental topological             
              properties and constructions, and would likely require new                     
              techniques applicable to a variety of other problems.
