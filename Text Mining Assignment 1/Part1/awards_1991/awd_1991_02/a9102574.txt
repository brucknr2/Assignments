Abstract    :
                   This project involves research on nonconvex variational                   
              problems, singular perturbation, and nonlinear partial                         
              differential equations.  The connections between nonconvex                     
              problems and the "relaxed problems" obtained by introducing a                  
              convex perturbation will be analyzed, as well as the connections               
              between variational problems and the gradient flows they                       
              generate.  Particular cases to be emphasized are variational                   
              problems depending on a gradient, locally area-minimizing                      
              partitions, flows driven by mean curvature, and optimal design                 
              via least gradient.                                                            
                   The results of this project will lead to better                           
              understanding of physical problems related to material                         
              instabilities, which in turn will help in the development of new               
              materials. ***
