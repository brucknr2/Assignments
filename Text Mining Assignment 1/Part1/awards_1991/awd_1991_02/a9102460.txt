Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Foothill-DeAnza Colleges request support from NSF for connection               
              of their campus networks to BARRnet.  BARRnet is the midlevel                  
              network located in the Bay Area of California.  It will provide                
              operations management and information services and it will give                
              Foothill-DeAnza Colleges a 56 thousand bits per second connection              
              to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per second)                 
              National Backbone network.                                                     
                   The Colleges needs greater functionality and network speed                
              to be able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file                  
              transfers along with being able to implement a more reliable mail              
              system. Students and faculty research will benefit from the link.              
              This is also a unique opportunity for the schools to explore                   
              innovative educational resources.
