Abstract    :
              This award supports cooperative research in field theory                       
              between Dr. B. L. Hu, Professor of Physics at the University                   
              of Maryland and Dr. E. Calzetta, Dr. J. P. Paz, research                       
              physicists of the Institute for Astronomy and Space Physics                    
              (IAFE), Argentina.  This collaboration has produced a series                   
              of significant research papers in the areas of non-equilibrium                 
              statistical mechanics, quantum field theory in curved                          
              spacetime and early cosmology.  Their recent  work in                          
              stochastic field theory has developed further these                            
              lines of investigation which now enables them to tackle                        
              basic problems of theoretical physics such as noise and                        
              fluctuation in inflationary cosmology, decoherence in quantum                  
              cosmology, and gravitational entropy of the universe.                          
                                                                                             
              The work in the next two years will be a continuation in the                   
              development of the statistical and stochastic quantum field                    
              theories and their application to basic problems in quantum                    
              mechanics, gravitation and relativistic cosmology.  Dr.                        
              Calzetta and Dr. Paz are capable young researchers from IAFE,                  
              the center of gravity research in Argentina.  Their training                   
              and background make it possible to benefit directly from, and                  
              contribute effectively to this research.  The University of                    
              Maryland has been an important international research center                   
              in relativity and gravitation physics.
