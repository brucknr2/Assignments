Abstract    :
              In this project the principal investigators will collect and                   
              interpret high-quality and high-resolution Conductivity/                       
              Temperature/Depth (CTD), oxygen and nutrient data in the North                 
              Central Pacific Ocean, along a line designated as P-14N by the                 
              World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE).  Specific topics to be              
              addressed with the data include:  1. Vertical structure of the                 
              subpolar and subtropical gyres and of mid-latitude zonal flow,                 
              2. The role of the Kuroshio Extension and the Alaska Stream in                 
              Central Pacific circulation, and, 3. The relation of large scale               
              circulation to thermo-haline and nutrient frontal zones, water                 
              mass transformation, and the deep circulation in the equatorial                
              zone.
