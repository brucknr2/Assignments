Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Fundamental research wil be conducted on transport and related                 
              phenomena in disordered media.  The influence of different types of            
              disorder on transport phenomena will include random substitutional             
              (percolation) disorder, spatially correlated disorder, and                     
              macroscopic heterogeneities.  Topics of study will include                     
              dispersion and related transport processes; transport in                       
              macroscopically heterogeneous media; and, fast passage and                     
              relaxation in hierarchical structures.
