Abstract    :
                   This proposal is for the acquisition of a state-of-the art                
              cooled imaging detector and imaging processing electronics to be               
              interfaced with and existing spectrometer.  This prototype                     
              imaging spectrometer will then be checked to demonstrate its                   
              suitability for spectroscopic remote sensing of very low light                 
              level optical signatures of upper atmospheric processes.***//
