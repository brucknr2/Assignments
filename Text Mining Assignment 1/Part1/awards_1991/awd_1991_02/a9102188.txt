Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Reactions of singlet oxygen with sulfides, sulfenates, allyl                   
              stannanes, and organotellurium compounds will be studied. The                  
              results of this research will be three-fold: 1) An expanded                    
              mechanistic understanding of oxidation reactions; 2) The                       
              development and utilization novel oxidizing agents; and                        
              3) Oxidation of novel substrates that will provide new synthetic               
              methods for the formation of potentially useful materials. In the              
              course of this investigation, the effects of neighboring groups on             
              sulfide photooxidations will be studied, the synthesis and                     
              properties of persulfenic acids and hydroperoxy sufuranes will be              
              examined, and the ability of these new classes of oxidizing agents             
              to transfer oxygen to heteroatoms and unsaturated substrates will              
              be studied.                                                                    
              %%%                                                                            
              This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the                      
              continuing work of Professor Edward Clennan at the University of               
              Wyoming. Molecular oxygen can be exposed to high intensity light               
              in the presence of a dye to generate an excited state of oxygen,               
              which is referred to as singlet oxygen. This excited state species             
              is a short-lived reactive molecule, which will oxidize various                 
              organic molecules. In this project, the detailed steps in the                  
              reaction of singlet oxygen with organic molecules will be studied.             
              Furthermore, the reactive intermediates that are generated in                  
              certain of these oxidations will be used to transfer oxygen atoms              
              to other organic molecules in a specific manner. This has                      
              potential application in the synthesis of unique molecules.
