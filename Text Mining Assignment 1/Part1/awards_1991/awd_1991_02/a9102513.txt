Abstract    :
              This is the first year of two year continuing award. Properties of             
              the well-founded semantics for (possibly) unstratified knowledge               
              bases are investigated for the purpose of implementing this                    
              semantics on a wide class of practical logic programs and expert               
              systems.  This project continues development of algorithms for                 
              automatically recognizing sets of rules that can be guaranteed to              
              terminate with the appropriate execution strategy. The project also            
              studies methods by which the compiler can optimize execution by                
              discovery of determinacy in the rules. In the presence of                      
              determinacy, the correct choice among alternatives can always be               
              made immediately, making backtracking unnecessary. The study                   
              focuses on the use of mode information and inductive type                      
              definitions.  This project  continues implementation of prototype              
              analyzers, compilers, and interpreters, building upon and extending            
              algorithms and software developed during prior research. A major               
              difficulty today in building large-scale rule-based systems is                 
              choosing effective control strategies for the various subsets of               
              rules, and current systems place virtually all of this burden on               
              the programmer.  An inferior choice can easily produce a                       
              nonterminating or extremely inefficient system. Progress in this               
              research will facilitate the development of tools that                         
              automatically choose effective control strategies in most cases,               
              and advise the programmer of unclear cases.
