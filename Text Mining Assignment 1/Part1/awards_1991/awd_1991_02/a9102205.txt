Abstract    :
                   This workshop addresses the critical long-term issue of                   
              educational competitiveness in engineering and science.  It brings             
              together nationally recognized leaders from the educational                    
              community and industry to craft an on-going regional program for               
              solving critical issues of technological literacy.  The forum will             
              also create a program to attract more students to careers in                   
              engineering and manufacturing.  The activity will be held in                   
              conjunction with the national conference of the Institute of                   
              Industrial Engineers and includes participation from the Society               
              of Manufacturing Engineers as well as other professional                       
              engineering organizations.
