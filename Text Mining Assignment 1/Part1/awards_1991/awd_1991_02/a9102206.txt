Abstract    :
                   A formalism of quantum optics which takes into account                    
              multiple levels of atomic systems and the spatial variations                   
              of the polarization of the light field will be developed and                   
              applied to problems of laser cooling.  Computer simulations of                 
              typical situations in three spatial dimensions will be carried                 
              out.  Finally, a theory of resonance fluorescence for multi-                   
              level atoms will be developed and applied to various problems.
