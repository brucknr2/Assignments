Abstract    :
                      This project is concerned with several topics in the                   
              homological theory of commutative rings and differential graded                
              algebras.  A theme of this research is that many problems arising              
              within the classical homological theory of rings are most                      
              effectively treated by placing them in the broader context of                  
              differential graded algebras.  The principal investigator will also            
              study homomorphisms of finite flat dimension.                                  
                       This research is on the interface of algebraic geometry               
              and commutative algebra.  This is currently a very active area in              
              which an associated commutative algebra is used to obtain refined              
              knowlege about the underlying geometric object.
