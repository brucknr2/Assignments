Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The 1991 Northeast Regional Conference on Developmental biology                
              will be held at the Marine Biological Laboratory, Woods Hole, MA               
              on the weekend of April 19-21. This proposal requests funds to                 
              support graduate student attendance and participation at the                   
              meeting. As a general goal, the Conference is organized with the               
              intent of bringing together a broad range of developmental                     
              biologists, at various stages of their careers, to present and                 
              discuss their research in formal and informal settings. further,               
              we will continue to integrate research in both plant and animal                
              developmental biology in an effort to enhance the communication                
              between groups that have traditionally been separated. The                     
              Conference will include four formal platform sessions, two poster              
              presentation sessions, and a keynote address; a format that                    
              proved quite successful at last year's meeting. Additionally, the              
              Conference will have a video microscopy session and an informal                
              workshop on the use of Polymerase Chain Reaction technology.                   
              There will also be ample time for informal discussions.                        
              Consequently, the revised format at this year's meeting will                   
              afford ample opportunity for young investigators to present their              
              research to an interested audience.
