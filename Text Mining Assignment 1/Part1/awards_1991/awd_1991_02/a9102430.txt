Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A 5-story full-scale reinforced masonry                                        
              research building test is undertaken in this                                   
              project.  This is the final research project                                   
              under the TCCMAR program which will enable                                     
              the limit state masonry design guideline and                                   
              analytical model verification to be                                            
              completed.  The research building under                                        
              testing consists of a 5-story coupled shear                                    
              wall structure which will allow a ductile                                      
              system behavior while providing a complex                                      
              test bed for so far unanswered analytical and                                  
              design model verification in areas such as                                     
              effective width of flanged walls and floor                                     
              diaphragms, coupling effects of floors, as                                     
              well as higher mode effects on design shear                                    
              forces.  The experiments will be conducted in                                  
              the Charles Lee Powell Structural Laboratory                                   
              at the University of California, San Diego                                     
              using the pseudo-dynamic testing facilities.                                   
                                                                                             
              The basic objectives of the research are to                                    
              test the TCCMAR design philosophy and                                          
              recommendation for seismic reinforced masonry                                  
              structures and provide a viable experimental                                   
              verification of the analytical procedures                                      
              developed.                                                                     
                                                                                             
              The research will also provide insight into                                    
              the higher mode effects as they are                                            
              encountered in some of the current design                                      
              practice.  It is also expected to contribute                                   
              to the development of repair, retrofit and                                     
              strengthening measures for existing masonry                                    
              structures.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              This project is the capstone of the TCCMAR                                     
              Program which will be drawn into a successful                                  
              completion with this project and the                                           
              concurrent effort in developing the limit                                      
              state design standards underway through a                                      
              separate companion project.
