Abstract    :
              This project is concerned with parallel algorithms in computational            
              geometry that will be efficient when applied to large, real,                   
              databases.  The emphasis is on implementable algorithms instead of on          
              algorithms with merely good theoretical asymptotic performance.  Two           
              major techniques to be used are uniform grids and local                        
              topological structures.  The uniform grid allows efficient, easy,              
              spatial coincidence determination.  Local topological data structures          
              allow the calculation of mass properties of a (well-defined)                   
              polyhedron without having any global topological information.                  
                                                                                             
              This research will extend previous work in visible surface                     
              determination and Boolean combinations of polyhedra to higher level            
              algorithms.  These algorithms included determining mass properties of          
              a constructive solid geometry tree, finding the tool-path volume and           
              volume of material cut out by a numerically controlled drill,                  
              interference detection in robotics, and the cross-area problem in              
              cartography.  What these applications all have in common is the need           
              to determine spatial coincidences in large databases and to find mass          
              properties of Boolean combinations.
