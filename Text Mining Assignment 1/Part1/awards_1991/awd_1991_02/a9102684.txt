Abstract    :
                   The massachusetts Institute of Technology Haystack                        
              Observatory Atmospheric Sciences group, which staffs, maintains,               
              and operates the Millstone Hill incoherent scatter radat                       
              facility, will undertake a detailed investigation of the design                
              criteria pertinent to the development of the radar control and                 
              data acquisition system of the Polar Cap Observatory, to review                
              and evaluate current and proposed technical developments in this               
              area, and to provide an optimized design and cost plan for this                
              crucial system element.***//
