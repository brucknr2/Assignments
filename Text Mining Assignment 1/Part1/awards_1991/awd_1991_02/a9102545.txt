Abstract    :
                   This award provides funds for continuing support for                      
              developing and operating a first-class, imaging Fabry-Perot                    
              interferometer.  The major research thrust for this IFPI is to                 
              study the dynamics and temperatures of the midlatitude mesopause               
              region.  A secondary research thrust is to contribute to several               
              global programs involving thermospheric dynamics that are                      
              supported by CEDAR and STEP and to participate in specific local               
              research programs.  The observations will be made at Utah State                
              University's Bear Lake Observatory.***//
