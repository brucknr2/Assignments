Abstract    :
                   This grant partially supports the planning,                               
              organization, and conduct of the Southwestern Regional                         
              Symposium on Applied Computing (SAC91).  The symposium is co-                  
              sponsored by ten regional universities, ACM, IEEE-CS, and                      
              private industry.  SAC'91 is unusual in several respects:                      
              it is a vehicle for technology outreach between research                       
              institutions and teaching institutions in the area; it                         
              provides nationally recognized speakers in a regional                          
              conference setting thus allowing greater interaction with                      
              students; it draws many of its student participants from                       
              institutions with significant Native American and minority                     
              populations underrepresented in science and engineering.                       
              This is the fifth annual symposium on applied computing; it                    
              has increased awareness of the technology potential of the                     
              region and increased interaction between the supporting                        
              institutions in the region.
