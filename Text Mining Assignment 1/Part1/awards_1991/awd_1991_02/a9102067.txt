Abstract    :
              This applicant proposes to study regulation of the system which                
              produces the protein elastin.  More specifically, the work will                
              employ biochemistry and molecular biology techniques to focus on               
              the effects of cell division stage and messenger RNA stability on              
              the replication and transcription processes.   The work is                     
              planned to take place in the laboratory of Dr. Carl Franzblau at               
              the Boston University School of Medicine.
