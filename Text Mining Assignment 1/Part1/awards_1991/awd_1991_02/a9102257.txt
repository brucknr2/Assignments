Abstract    :
              Dr. Walter Pollard has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research                    
              Fellowship in Chemistry.  Dr. Pollard's doctoral degree was                    
              from the University of California at Berkeley under the                        
              supervision of Professor Richard Mathies. Dr. Pollard intends                  
              to continue research at Columbia University under the                          
              sponsorship of Professor Richard Friesner. Dr. Pollard's                       
              postdoctoral training will be the analytical development and                   
              numerical implementation of new aqpproaches to the                             
              quantum-mechanical and mixed quantum/classical dynamics of                     
              large systems. Longer term, he plans theoretical studies of the                
              reaction dynamics of excited state intramolecular proton                       
              transfer in hydrogen-bonding solvents

              The Postdoctoral Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as                 
              an important infrastructural program designed to broaden the                   
              knowledge and experience of new Ph.D.s and attract them into                   
              meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research and                       
              teaching.
