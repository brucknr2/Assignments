Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              An experiment is to be conducted with a very large number of                   
              hotwire probes to diagnose the coherent structure content of a                 
              turbulent jet.  Simultaneous signals from these probes wiol be                 
              utilized to create an experimental reconstruction of the                       
              flow by way of the modes inferred from a Proper Orthogonal                     
              Decomposition (POD), as well as the dynamical mode                             
              interaction.  This will be compared to a POD decomposition                     
              constructed from existing nonsimultaneous data combined with                   
              modeling, to infer the quality of the model used in this                       
              latter scheme.  The data will also be subjected to various                     
              conditional sampling schemes to evaluate the ability of such                   
              schemes to capture coherent structures.                                        
                                                                                             
              The research is aimed at evaluating various existing and                       
              proposed schemes to experimentally extract the coherent                        
              content of turbulent flows.  Predictive modeling of such flows                 
              is presently handicapped by lack of reliable information on                    
              these structures.
