Abstract    :
                   The properties of intense electromagnetic pulses propagating              
              through magnetized plasmas are investigated.  These pulses,                    
              observed to propagate as solitary whistlers in a large, dense                  
              laboratory magneto-plasma, are of intrinsic interest as non-                   
              linear wave phenomena, and of possible significance to particle                
              acceleration and heating in space, and to fusion plasmas.  The                 
              investigation focusses on (i) the self-consistent field                        
              configurations of the pulses ranging from the linear to the non-               
              linear regime; (ii) the propagation, dispersion, and conservation              
              of energy and magnetic helicity; (iii) the interaction of two                  
              solitary non-linear whistler pulses; and (iv) wave-particle                    
              interactions.
