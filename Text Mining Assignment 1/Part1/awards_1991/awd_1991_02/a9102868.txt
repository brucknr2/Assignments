Abstract    :
              This grant will support a symposium, November 15 and 16, l991 at the           
              University of Texas at Austin, on the research areas of automatic              
              theorem proving and artificial intelligence.  The symposium will be            
              held in honor of Woodrow Bledsoe, a leading figure in combining the            
              resolution and equality approaches of traditional automated reasoning          
              with the heuristic approaches of artificial intelligence to achieve            
              high performance inference.  The symposium will provide an opportunity         
              to analyze recent programs in these areas and to further the interplay         
              between them.
