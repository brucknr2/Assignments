Abstract    :
                   This research will focus on function theoretic properties of              
              L-convex manifolds.  These L-convex manifolds are complex manifolds            
              which are convex with respect to sections of a bundle L.  L-convex             
              manifolds have recently proven useful in attacking some classical              
              problems in homomorphic convexity, such as the Levi problem and                
              Shafarevich's Conjecture on the universal covering space of a                  
              projective variety.  The project involves five areas of research:              
              exhaustion functions, approximation of sections, embedding,                    
              cohomology with values in a coherent analytic sheaf, and                       
              characterization by local boundary conditions.                                 
                   This research is in the general area of the geometric analysis            
              of surfaces or manifolds.  These manifolds or surfaces exist in                
              two, three, or many dimensions and involve both analytic and                   
              geometric techniques to understand and describe their structure.               
              Often the surface is given coordinates and a metric which provides             
              a measurement of distance or angle.  In this project the manifolds             
              have coordinates over the complex field and support a hermitian                
              metric.
