Abstract    :
                   Professor Galicki will continue his research in hyperkahler               
              and quaternionic geometry related to problems in mathematical                  
              physics. He will construct new Kahler metrics which are invariant              
              under a quaternionic action on the space and which satisfy                     
              prescribed curvature conditions. In addition, Professor Galicki                
              will study certain first order differential systems analogous to               
              the vortex equation and monopole equations.                                    
                   The principal investigator's work is cross disciplinary. The              
              research in the differential geometry of quaternionic manifolds                
              often uses results and methods of mathematical physics. At the                 
              same time, the powerful methods of differential geometry                       
              frequently bring about a better understanding of important                     
              problems in the search for a unified field theory.
