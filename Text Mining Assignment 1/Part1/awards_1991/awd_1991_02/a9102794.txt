Abstract    :
                   In this project the principal investigator will study                     
              problems in the theory of analytic functions of several complex                
              variables.  In particular, he will look at the following                       
              questions in regard to one-dimensional subvarieties having thin                
              ends:  uniqueness, complex tangents, boundary accessibility and                
              the relationship of harmonic measure to linear measure.  Further               
              areas of study include function-theoretic hulls of graphs in                   
              complex three-space, the boundary behavior of analytic maps, and               
              the finding of disks in certain polynomial hulls in two-space.                 
                   The theory of functions of several complex variables is a                 
              difficult subject in which one's intuition derived from the                    
              theory of functions of a single complex variable is often of                   
              little help and sometimes even misleading.  The principal                      
              investigator of this project approaches problems in several                    
              complex variables from the point of view of what is called                     
              "geometric measure theory".  This theory will enable him to                    
              continue his important work in the behavior of analytic functions              
              near boundaries and in the convexity of spaces of analytic                     
              functions.
