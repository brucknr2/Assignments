Abstract    :
                   The Fellow plans to develop and evaluate a series of                      
              mathematical models of global biogeochemical cycles with particular            
              attention to the carbon cycle.  These models will help clarify an              
              understanding of global climate change and, in particular,                     
              elucidate the role and function of the carbonate- silicate cycle               
              in effecting long-term climate change.  The Fellow has chosen the              
              Pennsylvania State University as his tenure institution.
