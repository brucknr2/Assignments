Abstract    :
                   This grant supports Dr. R. Ross as a post-doctoral associate              
              of Professor R. Guralnick.  Dr. Ross will investigate the Beilinson            
              conjectures that relate the algebraic K-theory to the behavior of              
              the Hasse-Weil L-function at s=0.                                              
                   This project falls into the general area of arithmetic                    
              geometry -a subject that blends two of the oldest areas of                     
              mathematics: number theory and geometry.  This combination has                 
              proved extraordinarily fruitful - having recently solved problems              
              that withstood generations.  Among its many consequences are new               
              error correcting codes.  Such codes are essential for both modern              
              computers (hard disks) and compact disks.
