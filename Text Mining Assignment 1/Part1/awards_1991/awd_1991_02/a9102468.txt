Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  This proposed study will analyze a sediment core to                       
              relate long-term sediment accumulations with Werner Deuser's 10                
              years worth of sediment trap data collected near Bermuda. A                    
              wide variety of techniques will be used to document the change                 
              in various sedimentary parameters within the cores- O-18,                      
              lipids, grain size, cyanobacteria, dinoflagellates, Cd,Ba,CaCo3,               
              opa,l230-Th, clay minerals, etc. The result of this study will                 
              attempt to document the temporal variability of particle flux and              
              near-bottom transport near Bermuda, with implications for much of              
              the western North Atlantic.
