Abstract    :
                   Three attacks on the problem of analysis of multivariate                  
              survival functions are to be made.  First, notions of dependence               
              and of asymmetry are to be incorporated into familiar                          
              formulations with product limit representations.  Secondly,                    
              representations in terms of generalized cumulants of counting                  
              processes will be investigated.  Third, estimators will be                     
              constructed for censored data from a Markov renewal process; and               
              the prediction problem will be considered.
