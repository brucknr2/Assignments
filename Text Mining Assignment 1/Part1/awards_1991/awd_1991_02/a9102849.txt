Abstract    :
                   This award enables enhancement of an existing statewide                   
              academic network for North Dakota.  The network has 12 nodes, 11 of            
              which are state-supported institutions of higher learning, and one             
              is a state government agency.  One of the nodes now connects to                
              NSFNET through NORTHWESTNET, and will provide connectivity for the             
              other state nodes.  The award allows for installation at each                  
              higher education site of a router which can accomodate both TCP/IP             
              and a proprietary protocol currently being used.  The existing                 
              transmission line speed is being upgraded from 56,000 bits per                 
              second to 1.544 million bits per second.  The network continues to             
              be operated by a state government agency, and owned and managed by             
              the state government and the higher education computer network.                
              Duration of the award is two years.
