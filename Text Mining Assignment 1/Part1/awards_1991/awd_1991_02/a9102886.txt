Abstract    :
                   This project is concerned with the regularity theory for a                
              class of nonlinear elliptic equations and associated variational               
              problems involving derivatives of the rearrangement of solutions,              
              as well as related questions concerning convex symmetrization.                 
              The main emphasis is to be placed on variational problems which                
              are approximable by sequences of multilayer free boundary                      
              problems.  Regularity and structure of the level surfaces of                   
              solutions will be studied.                                                     
                   This project has been motivated by a model of quasi static                
              equilibrium of confined toroidal plasmas in thermonuclear fusion               
              research, and the study of rotational fluid flow.  The technical               
              questions to be addressed have fundamental implications in areas               
              such as fusion energy.
