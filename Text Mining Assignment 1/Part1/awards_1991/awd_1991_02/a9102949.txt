Abstract    :
              This award will provide supplementary support to enable Dr. Don                
              Elsenheimer of the University of Wisconsin to conduct                          
              collaborative research with Dr. Yukihiro Matsuhisa for 24 months               
              at the Geological Survey of Japan in Tsukuba, Japan.  They will                
              utilize laser microprobe techniques which Elsenheimer developed                
              to analyze the hydrothermal alteration and mineralization                      
              associated with ancient and modern calc-alkaline volcanism.                    
                                                                                             
              Hydrothermal fluids are always chemically altering the earth's                 
              crust and are responsible for many types of economic                           
              mineralization. The recent development of a new ion and laser                  
              microprobe technique now enables scientists to conduct detailed                
              micro-analytical studies necessary to determine quantities of                  
              isotope mineralization and to decipher the histories of these                  
              complex hydrothermal systems.   Utilizing Elsenheimer's in situ                
              laser oxygen isotope analysis techniques, the team will examine                
              rock samples recovered from active seafloor hydrothermal fields                
              in the back-arc basin of the Okinawa Trench and the North Fiji                 
              Basin.  Dr. Matsuhisa's expertise on isotope geochemistry of                   
              hydrothermal mineralization, as well as the laser microprobe                   
              facility and rock samples at the Geological Survey of Japan,                   
              complement Dr. Elsenheimer's experience with the laser microprobe              
              and will facilitate the research on fluid/rock interactions in                 
              the earth's crust.
