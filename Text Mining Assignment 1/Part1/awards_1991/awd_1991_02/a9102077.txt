Abstract    :
                   The purpose of this project is to analyze various aspects of              
              hyperbolic structures on 3-dimensional manifolds.  Professor                   
              Kerckhoff will study the deformation theory of hyperbolic cone                 
              manifolds, manifolds with Dehn surgery singularities, and                      
              infinite-volume geometrically finite manifolds, using a                        
              differential geometric analysis of the relevant Hodge theory.                  
              Professor Canary wishes to study the analytic and topological                  
              structure of the ends of hyperbolic 3-manifolds and their                      
              relation to the deformation theory of Kleinian groups.                         
                   Three-manifolds are very natural objects of study.  We live               
              in one, after all.  It is therefore surprising what large gaps                 
              remain in our knowledge of them.
