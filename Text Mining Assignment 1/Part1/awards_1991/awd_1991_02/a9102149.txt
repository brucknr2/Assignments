Abstract    :
              This project addresses the topic of fault diagnosis of mechanical              
              systems.  Unexpected machinery breakdown can lead to lost                      
              production, expensive repair work, and safety problems.  The two               
              traditional methods of maintainance involve either letting                     
              machines run to breakdown or scheduling repairs at predetermined               
              intervals.  An alternative is to monitor machine condition in                  
              process, and implement repairs only when necessary.  The research              
              focuses on this fault diagnosis approach and attempts to cope                  
              with fault signature variability, the main source of difficulty                
              for existing diagnostic systems.  In the proposed method, multi                
              valued influence matrix (MVIM), diagnostic signals are monitored               
              on line, and flagged upon the detection of an abnormality.  The                
              method offers a methodical approach to diagnostic reasoning which              
              is suited to on line application and also establishes a framework              
              to select and optimize diagnostic sensors.  Two diagnostic                     
              problems, tool breakage in machining and fault diagnosis of                    
              helicopter power trains will be used to test the MVIM method.
