Abstract    :
                   SRI International will establish a permanent lidar facility               
              at Sondre Stromfjord, Greenland, capable of performing Rayleigh                
              and resonant scatter measurements.  The Arctic lidar technology                
              (ARCLITE) facility will be installed at the Sondrestrom                        
              incoherent-scatter radar site to allow complementary studies with              
              collocated upper-atmospheric instrumentation, existing and                     
              planned.  The ARCLITE facility will concentrate on measurements                
              of sodium D2 resonance backscatter to provide information on the               
              characteristics of the high-latitude sodium layer, and on                      
              Rayleigh backscatter measurements to provide information on the                
              structure of the high-latitude mesosphere/stratosphere region.***//
