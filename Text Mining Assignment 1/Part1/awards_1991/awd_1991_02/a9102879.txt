Abstract    :
              High-Tc superconducting films are very promising as coatings                   
              for low-temperature radiation shields, potentially yielding                    
              heat leaks an order of magnitude smaller than gold films.                      
              However, accurate knowledge of the high-Tc film optical                        
              properties is required to evaluate the effectiveness of this                   
              use of the films.  At present, there are no high-precision                     
              experimental data for the infrared reflectance of high-Tc                      
              superconducting films at low temperatures.  Existing data                      
              suffer from limited instrument accuracy and reference mirror                   
              errors.  There are no engineering methods for the precise                      
              prediction of this paramever, particularly in the high-                        
              reflectance region.  To address this problem reflectance                       
              measurements of high-Tc superconducting films are being                        
              performed with a precision grating spectrometer using an                       
              eightfold reflection technique that does not employ a                          
              reference mirror.  Two theories of superconductor optical                      
              properties, based on BCS theory and valid in the pure limit,                   
              are compared to these measurements.  Approximate relations for                 
              engineering use will be derived.                                               
                                                                                             
              The precision reflectance data collected in this study provide                 
              for the first time a quantitative assessment of the                            
              feasibility of high-Tc superconducting radiation shields.
