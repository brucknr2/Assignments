Abstract    :
              The main objective of his proposal is to request the sponsorship               
              of NSF in the organization of an International Workshop on High                
              Performance Fiber Reinforced Cement Composites to be held in Main,             
              Germany, 6/91.  The workshop is cosponsored by DFG, Germany's                  
              counterpart of NSF.  These Composites include materials such SIFCON            
              (slurry Infiltrated Fiber Concrete), fiber reinforced DSP                      
              (Densified Small Particles), and CRC (Compact Reinforced Concrete).            
              They have been shown to develop very high strengths (up to 40 ksi              
              in compression) while maintaining high ductilities.  Advanced                  
              composites and the fundamental understanding of their behavior is              
              a rapidly expanding branch within the field civil engineering                  
              materials.  The main object of the proposed workshop is to provide             
              a forum for discussion, primarily among specialists, as to the                 
              latest developments in the field and future directions to follow.
