Abstract    :
                   The purpose of this CEDAR project is to better understand                 
              the coupling between the magnetosphere and ionosphere, and to                  
              quantify the resultant energy input into the neutral atmosphere.               
              The proposed strategy has two components: first, to establish                  
              empirical models of convection in the high latitude ionosphere                 
              for various parameters of the interplanetary medium and magnetic               
              activity; second, to examine carefully selected events that                    
              correspond to stable wind conditions.  A combination of empirical              
              modeling and case studies is needed because the ionospheric                    
              conditions are highly variable; the ionosphere-magnetosphere                   
              system is controlled by several processes, each with a response                
              time characterized by different time scale.  Therefore, the                    
              empirical models might not provide an accurate description of the              
              pattern obtained for individual circumstances even when events                 
              corresponding to stable conditions are considered.  Another                    
              aspect of our approach will be, when appropriate, to map electric              
              fields, currents, and auroral features to the magnetospheric                   
              equatorial plane.
