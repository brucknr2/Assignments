Abstract    :
              This renewal award is made in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and                  
              Organometallic Chemistry Program to Clemson University in                      
              support of the research of Dr. Joseph W. Kolis. The thrusts of                 
              the research will be: (1) the synthesis and characterization of                
              transition metal chalcogenide carbonyls, (2) the synthesis and                 
              characterization of mixed main group anion clusters prepared                   
              from transition metal carbonyls and arsenic and phosphorous                    
              sulfides and selenides, and (3) the synthesis under                            
              kinetically-controlled conditions of solid-state materials                     
              based on the above chemistry. The use of molten salts and                      
              supercritical solvents will be employed to prepare solid-state                 
              clusters in a mid-temperature regime where decomposition to                    
              thermodynamically stable products does not occur.

              An investigation into the coordination chemistry of novel main                 
              group anions will provide new transition metal chalcogenides,                  
              new mixed main group anion clusters and new solid-state                        
              materials. Possible applications are catalysis, lubrication,                   
              battery components and semiconductors.
