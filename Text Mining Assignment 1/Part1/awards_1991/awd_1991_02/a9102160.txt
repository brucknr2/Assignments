Abstract    :
                   This awards supports the research of Professor K. Matsuki to              
              work in algebraic geometry.  Professor Matsuki will study algebraic            
              3-folds.  He will investigate the basic properties of minimal                  
              models as well as try to extend Mori's program to higher                       
              dimensional varieties.                                                         
                   This research is in the field of algebraic geometry, one of               
              the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which blossomed to             
              the point where it has, in the past 10 years, solved problems that             
              have stood for centuries.  Originally, it treated figures defined              
              in the plane by the simplest of equations, namely polynomials.                 
              Today, the field uses methods not only from algebra, but also from             
              analysis and topology, and conversely it is extensively used in                
              those fields.  Moreover, it has proved itself useful in fields as              
              diverse as physics, theoretical computer science, cryptography,                
              coding theory and robotics.
