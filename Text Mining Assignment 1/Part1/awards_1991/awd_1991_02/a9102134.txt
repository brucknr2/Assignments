Abstract    :
                   Common carrier operations, including truckload trucking, less-            
              than-truckload trucking, rail and ocean container, are playing                 
              increasingly important roles in the manufacturing and production               
              process.  These carriers are, for the most part, being asked to                
              provide an even higher quality of service for an even lower cost               
              for shippers using their standard services.  This pressure has been            
              combined with a substantial increase in the size of the largest                
              carriers, complicating the overall operation.                                  
                   A common mathematical foundation is developed which focuses               
              on dynamic fleet management under forecasting uncertainties, which             
              is formulated as a network with random arc capacities (representing            
              market demands).  A novel solution strategy is used, extending                 
              similar research developed for stochastic models of truckload                  
              operations.                                                                    
                   The core of the research is on the solution of                            
              stochastic, dynamic models arising in fleet management problems,               
              and the development of approximation methods for stochastic                    
              programs that allow the solution of large, real-world problems.                
              Extensive empirical testing in a simulation environment is planned.
