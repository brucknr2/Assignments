Abstract    :
              This research, supported by the Analytical and Surface                         
              Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division, will seek new ways                
              to separate and characterize large molecules and small                         
              particulates using Field Flow Fractionation, a technique                       
              pioneered by the principal investigator.  Crossed flows of                     
              solvents or crossed force fields (fluid flow vs. temperature,                  
              fluid flow vs. electric field, or fluid flow vs. gravity) are                  
              employed to separate molecules and particulates based on                       
              differences in their density, electrical mobility, and                         
              diameter.  Applications include both preparation of                            
              mono-dispersed particulates and analysis of mixtures.

              This research, supported by the Analytical and Surface                         
              Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division, renews support of                 
              the principal investigator's work in field flow fractionation                  
              (FFF) for separation and analysis of large molecules and                       
              particulates.  FFF separates molecules, particulates, or cells                 
              based on the competitive interaction of a fluid flow adn a                     
              perpendicular force field (flow of a second fluid, gravity,                    
              heat, or electric field) with the mixture to be separated.                     
              This contrasts with more common separation methods that depend                 
              on the chemical interaction of the substances to be separated                  
              with a stationary, selective phase.  The current proposal                      
              focuses on separations of polymers and emulsions, based on                     
              thermal gradients.
