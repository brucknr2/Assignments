Abstract    :
                   Professor Balaban will conduct research on low temperature                
              classical and quantum spin systems with continuous symmetry groups,            
              in particular on the classical and quantum Heisenberg models and               
              the Hubbard model.  For these models he will construct a low                   
              temperature expansion using the renormalization group approach.  He            
              will use this expansion to prove basic facts about the models such             
              as the existence of a continuum of pure phases with spontaneous                
              magnetization and power law decay of correlations.                             
                   The models which Professor Balaban will investigate are                   
              mathematical models of magnetic materials.  The ultimate goal is to            
              provide the basic understanding of magnetism in materials which is             
              lacking at the present time.  The method is to tackle models which             
              are closer and closer to reality.
