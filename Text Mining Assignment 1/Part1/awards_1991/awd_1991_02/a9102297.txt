Abstract    :
                   This project is aimed at constructing a theory of contraction             
              operators on Krein spaces which, in areas such as dilation and                 
              extension properties, parallels the Hilbert space case.  Recent                
              work has shown that dilations and extensions exist and can be                  
              characterized.   New problems of labeling will be investigated.                
              Examples include substitution operators induced by normalized                  
              Riemann mappings for subregions of the unit disk.  A long-range                
              goal is to apply the theory to a coefficient interpolation problem             
              for Riemann mappings.                                                          
                   This project is in the general area of modern analysis and                
              involves the study of spaces and the transformations or operators              
              on these spaces.  Probably one of the most studied and valuable                
              spaces in physics, analysis, and geometry is the Hilbert space.                
              The Krein space examined in this project is a space with a scalar              
              product which is decomposable as the orthogonal direct sum of a                
              Hilbert space and the anti-space of a Hilbert space.
