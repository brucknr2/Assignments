Abstract    :
              The Memphis State University Center for Electron Microscopy                    
              requests funds to purchase a transmission electron microscope                  
              (TEM) for use by faculty and students of the university.  Among                
              the projects depending on this TEM are: 1) studies of structure                
              and function in cellular components of an unusual cyanobacterium,              
              TEM of phycobilisomes; 2) TEM of calcium secretion in plants; 3)               
              development of the plant microsymbiont Frankia as affected by an               
              unusual cell wall surface layer; 4) immunogold localization of                 
              cytokinin in developing legume root nodules; 5) vetellogenesis in              
              ticks, elucidation of the mechanism of saliva secretion in ticks;              
              and 6) investigation of cellular events leading to oocyte                      
              maturation.
