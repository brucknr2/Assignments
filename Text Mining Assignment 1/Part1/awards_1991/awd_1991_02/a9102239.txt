Abstract    :
              Dr. Michael M. Haley has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research                  
              Fellowship in Chemistry. Dr. Haley's doctoral degree was from                  
              Rice University under the supervision of Professor W.E.                        
              Billups. Dr. Haley intends to continue research at the                         
              University of California at Berkeley under the sponsorship of                  
              Professor K.P.C. Vollhardt.  Dr. Haley's area of postdoctoral                  
              research and training will be total synthesis and                              
              organometallic catalysis.  Longer term, he plans to apply his                  
              synthetic skills to the generation of new forms of carbon.

              The Postdoctoral Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as                 
              an important infrastructural program designed to broaden the                   
              knowledge and experience of new Ph.D.s and attract them into                   
              meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research and                       
              teaching.
