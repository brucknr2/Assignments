Abstract    :
              Recent developments in meta-logics and logical frameworks have lead to         
              a new notion of syntax appropriate for specifying computations on such         
              data structures as programs, formulas, proofs, types, and lambda-              
              terms.  New meta-programming languages and computer systems have               
              already been designed around these new approaches to syntax.                   
              Semantics of meta programs seem to be best explained using                     
              combinations of proof theoretic concepts, Kripke models,                       
              realizability, and logical relations.  This award supports further             
              research into intuitutionistic, constructive, and linear logics.  Much         
              of this research is inspired by topics in computational logic, logic           
              programming, and meta-programming.  Theoretical results of this work           
              will be applied to issues of programming language design so that               
              logical principles of syntax can be made directly accessible to                
              programmers and system builders and to keep a practical and                    
              experimental focus to this proposed research.
