Abstract    :
                The principal investigator will study the problem of imbedding               
              three dimensional CR manifolds into Euclidean space. He will                   
              approach the problem of imbeddibility of CR manifolds in terms of              
              a moduli space and attempt to describe those CR manifolds which are            
              imbeddible by relating the problem to a circle action on the                   
              boundary of a convex domain. In particular he will try to                      
              understand how the circle action changes when the CR structure is              
              perturbed.                                                                     
                A CR manifold is an important abstract structure in the geometry             
              of spaces of complex numbers. To better understand these spaces one            
              would like to visualize them as subspace of the usual Euclidean                
              space such as our everyday three dimensional space. The principal              
              investigator will attempt to describe when this visualization or               
              "imbedibility" is possible.
