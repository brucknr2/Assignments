Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will study several problems in the             
              geometry of domains in complex Euclidean space. In particular, he              
              will investigate regularity properties of the Bergman projection               
              operator which relates boundary behavior of holomorphic functions              
              to their behavior on the interior of a domain. Another topic to be             
              considered on this research project is the topology of Levi flat               
              hypersurfaces. Both of these subjects require an analysis of the               
              d"-operator on domains in n-dimensional complex space.                         
                   This research continues the study of the geometry and analysis            
              of functions of several complex variables. The theory of functions             
              of one complex variable plays a central role in all branches of                
              mathematics and physics. This research project will undertake                  
              continued research on functions of more than one variable which is             
              analogous to the well studied classical situation. One surprising              
              application of the research thus far has been to queuing theory                
              which studies the order in which processes are performed.
