Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              Further study of the process of organic matter adsorption by                   
              marine sediments will focus two areas:  the effect of the                      
              composition of peptides on their adsorption and decomposition,                 
              and the further investigation of the "irreversible" adsorption of              
              amino acids observed in earlier work.  The approach is to observe              
              the adsorption of radiolabeled peptides of varying composition                 
              and chain length, synthesized for this study. Longer-term studies              
              of the adsorption of radiolabeled amino acids by sediments and                 
              extracted sediment organic matter will also be done.  A broad                  
              objective is better understanding of the processes leading to the              
              preservation of organic matter in marine sediments, which remains              
              a poorly-understood phenomenon.
