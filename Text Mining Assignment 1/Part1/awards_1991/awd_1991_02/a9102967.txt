Abstract    :
                   This project will consider controllability of systems using               
              minimin control, linear dynamics using minimax control, optimal                
              control of rapidly oscillating systems, and multiple minimization              
              problems.  Weak solutions, in particular viscosity solutions,                  
              will be used intensively throughout.  The effect of inertial                   
              controls rather than measurable controls will be examined in the               
              case of rapidly oscillating systems.                                           
                   These studies have applications in engineering design,                    
              economics, decision theory, and a variety of control systems.
