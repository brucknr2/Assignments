Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This applicant proposes to study the role of the zinc ions in the              
              reaction mechanism of alkaline phosphatase.  Specifically, he                  
              plans to substitute 113-Cd 2+ for the zinc ions which will allow               
              more detailed study using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance                           
              spectrometry.  The work is planned to take place in the                        
              laboratory of Professor Joseph Coleman at Yale University.
