Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is an experimental/computer simulation study of the mechanisms            
              of strengthening in austenitic stainless steels by addition of                 
              nitrogen.  Mechanical testing is performed at temperatures between             
              4 and 900 degrees Kelvin on single crystal specimens containing                
              controlled amounts of nitrogen.  Slip behavior is examined by                  
              electron microscopy.  Results are correlated with a flow stress                
              model developed on thermodynamic principles that predicts flow                 
              stress, including thermal activation of planar slip.  This research            
              improves our base for the development of nitrogen-containing                   
              steels.  Nitrogen strengthened steels may lead to low cost, high               
              strength alternatives to our present steels.  Such steels can                  
              exhibit excellent combinations of strength and toughness.
