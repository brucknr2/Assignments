Abstract    :
                   This award supports analysis of a unique data set taken at                
              Arecibo Observatory during the period 4-9 June,1989. These data                
              are the first known use of the Imaging Doppler Interferometer                  
              (IDI) technique taken in the region of 225 km to 450 km, as well               
              as the first known use of the IDI technique as a diagnostic for                
              an HF heating experiment. It is anticipated that this analysis                 
              program will provide additional insight into the cause of HF-                  
              induced spread-F. This program will also provide insight into                  
              the value of an IDI-based technique as an F-region diagnostic and              
              its appropriateness as an addition to existing and planned HF                  
              heating facilities. Although the IDI technique has demonstrated                
              promising results in the mesosphere, its potential in the                      
              ionosphere is yet to be determined.
