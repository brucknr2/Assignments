Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The proposed research will test the new hypothesis that plateau                
              uplift is a fundamental cause of late-Cenozoic climate change.                 
              Specifically, this work will involve sensitivity-test experiments              
              with two general circulation models (GCM's) as well as the analysis            
              of late-Cenozoic trends in cored DSP and ODP sequences to monitor              
              windblown dust fluxes and surface-ocean productivity in the                    
              equatorial Atlantic, eastern Atlantic and northwest Pacific oceans.            
              The results of this study should address several key questions                 
              about the late-Cenozoic, including the relative influence of                   
              orographic and CO2 changes to regional and global cooling as well              
              as to changes in moisture-balance patterns.
