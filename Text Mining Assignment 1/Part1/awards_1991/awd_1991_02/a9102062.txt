Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              3 '-azido-2 ',3'-deoxyuridine (AZDU) has commercial potential as               
              a therapeutic agent in the treatment of AIDS.  At the present                  
              time it is produced via a complex expensive solution synthesis.                
              The purpose of this Phase II SBIR research project is to                       
              investigate the scale-up potential of a solid phase synthesis                  
              procedure which has already been proven feasible in the                        
              laboratory under a Phase I grant.  The motivation includes                     
              substantial savings in production costs and an environmentally                 
              benign process with minimal waste generation.                                  
                                                                                             
              The process for the solid state synthesis progresses in four                   
              stages:                                                                        
                   1. Activation of the functionalized polymer support                       
                   2. Bonding of nucleoside to the resin                                     
                   3. Conversion to polymer-bound AZDU                                       
                   4. Product removal by hydrolysis with regeneration of the                 
                      functionalized polymer                                                 
              Eventually production could be largely automated.  There is a                  
              potential that in lots of several kilograms, AZDU can be produced              
              by solid-phase technology for half of the cost required for the                
              solution method.
