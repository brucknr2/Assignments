Abstract    :
                   This award will determine how to best field imagers and                   
              imaging spectrographs to pursue science goals in the polar cap.                
              The study will derive the needed sensitivity, wavelength and                   
              temporal ranges needed to acquire images in the polar cap.  The                
              current state of CEDAR imaging science will be reviewed along                  
              with emerging technologies in focal plane imaging prior to                     
              convening the first of two imaging workshops.***//
