Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              This award will provide supplementary support to enable Dr.                    
              Scott Kravis of Texas A&M University to conduct collaborative                  
              research with Dr. Yohko Awaya for 24 months at the Institute                   
              for Physical and Chemical Research (RIKEN) in Japan.  They                     
              will apply Dr. Kravis' Time of Flight (TOF) spectrometer to                    
              measure the photoionization cross-sections of ions using a                     
              collinear ion beam and synchrotron radiation geometry.                         
                                                                                             
              At present, the theory for inner-shell photoionization of                      
              ions is far ahead of experimentation.  The collaborative                       
              experimentation between Dr. Kravis and Dr. Awaya is much                       
              needed to substantiate the photoionization theory.  Dr. Awaya                  
              and his expertise of the RILAC accelerator and SPring 8 GeV                    
              synchrotron radiation facility at RIKEN will complement Dr.                    
              Kravis' expertise in measuring transfer rate coefficients at                   
              low energies and measuring ionic distribution after inner-                     
              shell ionization.  Integral to their accelerator based                         
              experiments, Dr. Kravis' TOF spectrometer will detect                          
              scattered projectile in coincidence with a specific recoil ion                 
              charge state.
