Abstract    :
              9102966  Shiflet    Pearlite growth is investigated with respect to the role of 
              crystallography in the context of kinetics and thermodynamics.  The 
              mathematics for coupled pearlite colony growth are examined.    Experimental
              data are coupled to the thermodynamics and models of  growth kinetics.  With
              the use of a new Field Emission Gun  transmission electron microscope
              (FEG-TEM), composition gradients  in the developing colony are measured.  This
              approach together with  three dimensional modeling should assist in
              understanding phenomena  such as lamellar versus degenerate growth, pearlite
              versus bainite  phase selection, and orientation relationships.  %%%  This
              research program examines the factors affecting phase  transformations in metal
              alloys.  The understanding derived from  studies such as this one can be
              applied to a wide range of metal  alloy systems, such as steel alloys, to
              improve their properties.  ***
