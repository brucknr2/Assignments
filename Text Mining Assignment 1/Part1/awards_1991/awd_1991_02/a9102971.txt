Abstract    :
                   Professor Spielberg's research project centers on certain                 
              boundary actions of a Fuchsian group, related to the action of the             
              group on its limit set.  The fundamental example is that of the                
              modular group PSL(2,Z) acting on a Cantor set obtained by                      
              disconnecting the extended real line at the points of a countable              
              invariant set.  In this case the crossed product C*-algebra is                 
              isomorphic to a certain Cuntz algebra. The objects of study here               
              are more general Fuchsian groups which give rise in an analogous               
              fashion to other algebras of Cuntz and Krieger.                                
                   Professor Spielberg's research is in the area of C*-algebras.             
              These algebras consist of families of operators (infinite matrices             
              of complex numbers) with a certain reality property: the algebra is            
              generated by elements whose value in any state of the system is a              
              real number.  The study of these algebras was originally motivated             
              by physics, and they are still of major interest in this area and              
              in other branches of pure mathematics.
