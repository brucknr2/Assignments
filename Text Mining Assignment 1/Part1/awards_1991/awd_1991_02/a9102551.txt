Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                     This is a project to conduct a combined seismic and                    
              electromagnetic study of the axial volcanic region of a section                
              of the Reykjanes Ridge using the resources of Cambridge and                    
              Durham Universitites (UK), Flinders University (Australia), and                
              Scrips Institution of Oceanography (US). The Study will use (1)                
              wide angle seismic profiles along and across an axial volcanic                 
              ridge to determine the crustal structure, (2) a detailed                       
              electromagnetic sounding experiment centered on the ridge to                   
              determine crustal electrical conductivity structure, and (3) an                
              array of long.antenna electric field instruments and                           
              magnetometers to determine the deeper conductivity structure in                
              the mantle beneath the ridge axis by both controlled and natural               
              source electromagnetic sounding.
