Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Recent analysis of ocean bottom seismometer data indicates the            
              presence of very low rigidity bodies at the base of young oceanic              
              crust.  The data are conversions of compressional waves to shear               
              waves upon interaction with the Moho.  This project will map                   
              compressional-to-shear reflectivity of the Moho, using an extensive            
              ocean bottom seismograph survey along with simultaneous and                    
              independent short-streamer multichannel seismic data.  The survey              
              will be conducted on the East Pacific Rise near the overlapping                
              spreading center at 12 degrees 54 minutes north.
