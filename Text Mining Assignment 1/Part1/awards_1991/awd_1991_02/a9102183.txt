Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                     This Study will conduct a marine geophysical, geological,              
              geochemical, and chronological investigation of 19 seamounts in                
              the Magellan, Marshall, and Wake provinces in the western Pacific              
              ocean.  The goal is to document the Cretaceous Expression of the               
              South Pacific Isotopic and Thermal Anomaly.  Laser fusion                      
              40Sr/39Ar dating will provide the age control on the samples.                  
              Radiogenic isotope geochemistry of mineral Separates of                        
              phenocrysts will be used to avoid seawater alteration effects.                 
              Gravity data will be inverted with respect to elastic thickness                
              of the lithosphere and magnetic surveys will serve to determine                
              the magnetic paleopoles.  Thus this work will provide constraints              
              on the Cretaceous extent of South Pacific Isotopic and Thermal                 
              Anamaly on Pacific plate motion prior to 100 Ma, constraints on                
              the Cretaceous apparent polar wander path, and identification of               
              potential hotspot chains.
