Abstract    :
              Previous and on-going NSF-funded research by the PI shows that                 
              pore-water exchange carbonate particles, organic matter and sea                
              water is far more extensive than previously thought.  As a result,             
              platform carbonates may act as a sink for more organic carbon than             
              previously envisioned because of the storage of isotopically-                  
              depleted C in recrystallized carbonates.  The PI requests funds to             
              continue her work in looking at sediment/organism relations in                 
              determining chemical and microstructrual sedimentary parameters.               
              Some work will continue in Florida Bay, but new studies will begin             
              on Great and Little Bahama banks.
