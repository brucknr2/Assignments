Abstract    :
                 Professor Farrar is supported by a grant from the                           
              Experimental Physical Chemistry Program for nuclear magnetic                   
              resonance (NMR) relaxation studies to determine bond distances,                
              chemical shift tensors, and quadrupole coupling tensors of                     
              molecules in solution.  The molecular structure and dynamics of                
              molecular systems with three-fold axis symmetry or higher will                 
              be studied as a function of pH, solvent, concentration, and                    
              temperature.  These experimental results will be compared with                 
              ab initio calculations of chemical shift tensors and electric                  
              field gradient tensors at the nuclei.  X-ray and neutron                       
              diffraction experiments as well as solid state NMR experiments                 
              will complement the solution studies.                                          
              %%%                                                                            
              Nuclear magnetic resonance studies of molecules in solution                    
              will allow the determination of properties such as bond                        
              lengths, and the tensor quantities which are related to the                    
              electron distribution in the immediate vicinity of the nucleus.                
              The comparison of these properties with solid state and                        
              theoretical calculations will provide a measure of the effects                 
              of intermolecular interactions on these properties in solution.
