Abstract    :
                   Professor Pedersen will study commuting selfadjoint extensions            
              of first order partial differential operators acting on smooth                 
              functions of compact support on some domain.  Such extensions may              
              or may not exist depending on the given domain.  This project is               
              motivated in part by the desire to understand spectral properties              
              of higher order constant coefficient partial differential                      
              operators, and also by the connection between the spectrum of the              
              commuting selfadjoint extension and the geometry of the domain.                
              Professor Pedersen will also investigate the implications of these             
              ideas for the various Laplace operators associated to the domain.              
                   This project involves the connection between the theory of                
              differentiation (in many variables) and geometry in its simplest               
              form.  One of the ideas which Professor Pedersen will investigate              
              is how the eigenvalues of these differentiation operators are                  
              related to the geometry of the domain in n-space on which they are             
              defined.
