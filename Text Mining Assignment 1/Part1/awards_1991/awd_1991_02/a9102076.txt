Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is an SGER proposal concerned with the laser-assisted                     
              deposition of diamond.  The P.I. proposes to deposit                           
              diamond from gas mixtures containing CO by use of a dual                       
              laser system.  A short wavelength CO laser will cause                          
              vibrational excitement of the CO.  Ohio State has one of                       
              the four short wavelength CO lasers in the world.  A                           
              second, ArF laser will promote photolytic decomposition.                       
              If successful, the technique could lead to development of a                    
              clean, high rate and controllable diamond deposition                           
              process using far lower temperatures than other processes.
