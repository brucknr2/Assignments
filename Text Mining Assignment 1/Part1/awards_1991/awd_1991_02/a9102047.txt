Abstract    :
                   This awards supports the research of Professor D. Gieseker to             
              work in algebraic geometry.  Professor Gieseker will study the                 
              theory of isospectral deformations of difference operators and the             
              theory of stable bundles on an algebraic surface.  He intends to               
              study the Toda lattice and the irreducibility of the moduli space              
              of stable bundles.                                                             
                   This research is in the field of algebraic geometry, one of               
              the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which blossomed to             
              the point where it has, in the past 10 years, solved problems that             
              have stood for centuries.  Originally, it treated figures defined              
              in the plane by the simplest of equations, namely polynomials.                 
              Today, the field uses methods not only from algebra, but also from             
              analysis and topology, and conversely it is extensively used in                
              those fields.  Moreover, it has proved itself useful in fields as              
              diverse as physics, theoretical computer science, cryptography,                
              coding theory and robotics.
