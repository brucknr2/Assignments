Abstract    :
                        This project will simplify a wave equation approach to               
              harmonic analysis for symmetric spaces of negative curvature and               
              extend a perturbation theory for the wave equation on hyperbolic               
              manifolds.   The new theory is aimed at applications to quotient               
              spaces and hyperbolic manifolds with twist.                                    
                   This projects addresses fundamental mathematical questions                
              with potential applications for physics and chemistry.
