Abstract    :
                   This project will study singularity formation for systems of              
              parabolic equations.  The first part of the project will deal                  
              with singularity formation in boundary layer problems of fluid                 
              dynamics.  The second part of the project will study the role                  
              that the underlying geometry and parameters play in determining                
              whether or not blow up occurs is weakly coupled systems of                     
              equations.                                                                     
                   These studies come from and have applications in mechanics                
              of solids and fluids.  A wide variety of engineering design                    
              problems might benefit from the results of this project.
