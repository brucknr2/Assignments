Abstract    :
                   This project will produce theoretical and numerical results               
              on interior point methods for linear programming and other                     
              mathematical programming problems.  Specific objectives include:               
              a) Development of a primal-dual algorithm that not only possesses              
              the currently best optimal complexity bound but also the best                  
              achievable asymptotic convergence rate.  b) Development of                     
              techniques that can effectively utilize available information at               
              each iteration and overall efficiency, and  c) Development of                  
              techniques that effectively handle the singularity at non-vertex               
              or degenerate vertex solutions.  The methodology for this                      
              research will constantly combine numerical experimentation with                
              theoretical analysis, and will study primal-dual interior point                
              linear programming algorithms from the point of view of solving a              
              nonlinear system of equations.                                                 
                   Results of this project shall have a significant impact in                
              the design of telecomunication networks, large scale logistic                  
              planning, and scheduling.
