Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Studies will be made of the composition of Dissolved Organic                   
              Mater (DOM) in seawater using ultrafiltration as a means of                    
              isolating a larger, less altered, and more representative                      
              fraction than has been possible with hydrophobic adsorption                    
              techniques.  The DOM isolates will be characterized by CP/MAS                  
              13CNMR and analyses of elemental and major biochemical                         
              composition, which together should give a comprehensive                        
              assessment of their major structural features.  Selected                       
              additional experiments will be carried out to elucidate the                    
              biological sources, environmental reactivities and analytical                  
              accountability of this material.
