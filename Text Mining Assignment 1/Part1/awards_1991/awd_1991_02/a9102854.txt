Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to design, analyze, implement and test             
              several groups of parallel methods for solving sparse nonlinear                
              systems of equations on parallel computers.  The approach is to                
              transform sparse nonlinear systems of equations into some special              
              structures so that the computations can be decomposed for parallel             
              processing.  The research will concentrate on two  important classes           
              of naturally structured systems:  1) large-scale block bordered                
              systems of nonlinear equations, obtained by permuting general                  
              nonlinear systems.  It is planned to develop parallel explicit and             
              implicit methods and iterative methods for solving the block bordered          
              nonlinear systems of equations, including convergence analysis,                
              perturbation methods for singular or nearly singular block bordered            
              systems, applications of the secant method, and the implementations of         
              the methods on different types of parallel computers.  The                     
              investigation will also be extended to different direct and iterative          
              methods for solving the block triangular nonlinear systems of                  
              equations including the convergence analysis, applications of quasi-           
              Newton methods and asynchronous parallel methods for solving this type         
              of problems.  The method design is motivated by the use of parallel            
              computers, and the implementation and testing will be on parallel              
              computers.  The goal is, however, to discover new methods that                 
              efficiently solve sparse nonlinear systems of equations in structured          
              approaches on a parallel computer.
