Abstract    :
              The goal of this research is to investigate the nature of forces               
              between particles during sintering of ceramics. The nature of the              
              forces determines the conditions under which the particles and                 
              their grain boundaries are wet and, also, whether the liquid phase             
              can be rejected from the ceramic after densification. The specific             
              objectives of the project are to establish whether particles in a              
              sintering liquid are electrostatically charged and to determine the            
              force/separation function between particles. The work will                     
              primarily be carried out on zirconia based ceramics. The results               
              are expected to contribute significantly towards our fundamental               
              understanding of liquid phase sintering of ceramics and aid in the             
              control the wetting of grain boundaries to optimize properties of              
              practical ceramics presently limited by intergranular phases.
