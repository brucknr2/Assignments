Abstract    :
                   The innovations expected during the efforts carried out in                
              this project relate primarily to the integration of expert system              
              technology into mechanical design and finite element analysis.  The            
              resulting software will provide an efficient three-dimensional                 
              design tool that will make expert skills available to the novice               
              user without requiring an exhaustive background in the finite                  
              element theory and terminology.  This availability is likely to                
              reduce design time and productivity.  The design-representation                
              system (DRS) will represent the design in a format that may be                 
              addressed by a variety of other applications.  Feature-based design            
              is gaining popularity and the intended generality of the DRS will              
              represent an advance in this domain.                                           
                   This project presents some challenging obstacles that will                
              need to be overcome during its implementation.  The application of             
              expert system technology to mechanical engineering is a relatively             
              new field of research, and there is little prior work in this area.            
              It is expected that the research will capture the qualitative                  
              nature of analysis practices in the form of an integrated kilobyte             
              and also improve the capabilities of computer-aided design via                 
              artificial intelligence techniques.
