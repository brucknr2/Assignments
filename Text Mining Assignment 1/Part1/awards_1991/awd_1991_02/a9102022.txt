Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project supports the dissertation research of a cultural                  
              anthropologist studying large-scale population resettlement                    
              associated with an economic development project in China.  Using               
              methods of participant observation, surveys and intensive                      
              interviews of households, the project will study how people                    
              affected by resettlement can call upon their kinship networks to               
              develop creative solutions to the problems they face.  The theory              
              explaining how communities adapt to massive relocation and                     
              disruption has been developed from case studies in Africa, Latin               
              America and other areas, and this comparative case study will                  
              provide valuable material to advance our understanding.                        
                                                                                             
              This research is important because more and more communities in                
              the developing world will be affected by massive hydroelectric                 
              projects which flood them out of their historic homelands, as                  
              energy costs increase.  This additional case study from a part of              
              the world where resettlement has not been studied                              
              ethnographically will advance our understanding of the abilities               
              of people in traditional communities to adapt to radical change.
