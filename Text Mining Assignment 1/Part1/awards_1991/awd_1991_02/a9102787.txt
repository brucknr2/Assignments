Abstract    :
              This award involves providing support from the Idaho National                  
              Engineering Laboratory's Center for Environmental Monitoring and               
              Assessment to the U.S. Antarctic Program (USAP) in the area of                 
              antarctic environmental measurements.                                          
                                                                                             
              The amendment is necessary to:  1) fully implement NSF's Special               
              5-Year Initiative for Antarctic Safety, Environment and Health (a              
              critical part of which is the development of baselines for a wide              
              variety of antarctic environmental parameters) and the conduct of              
              projects for monitoring of potential environmental contaminants                
              near USAP's antarctic installations; 2) assure that environmental              
              measurements are reliable and repeatable, and provide sound bases              
              for environment-related actions undertaken by USAP managers and                
              decisionmakers; and 3) provide guidance on and conduct                         
              environmental measurements to other performers involved in USAP's              
              developing environmental measurements, assessment, management,                 
              and protection programs; and, 4) provide similar support to basic              
              science researchers supported by the Division of Polar Programs                
              whose work includes measurement of antarctic environmental                     
              parameters.  The Program Manager recommends award for Fiscal Year              
              1991 funds of $225,000.
