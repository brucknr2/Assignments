Abstract    :
                   The main concern of this project is to study smooth simply                
              connected 4-manifolds by using invariants obtained from gauge                  
              theory.  In particular, the investigator wishes to use 2-torsion               
              instanton invariants to study the result of taking connected sums              
              with S2 x S2.  Using the relation of these torsion invariants                  
              with the usual Donaldson invariants and using Z2-invariant                     
              theory, the investigator hopes to deduce universal relations for               
              certain Donaldson invariants.  He also plans to search for the                 
              proper setting for relative torsion invariants.                                
                   The interactions of this project with mathematical physics                
              go both ways.  On the one hand, four-dimensional manifolds are                 
              cosmologically important, since we live in a manifold of three                 
              space dimensions and one time dimension.  On the other hand, and               
              more surprisingly, notions from quantum mechanics have led to new              
              topological invariants of manifolds.
