Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The NMDA receptor, a subclass of the neurotransmitter glutamate                
              receptors, is widely present at synapses in the vertebrate                     
              central nervous system.  NMDA receptors have been implicated in                
              the process of long term potentiation, a model of learning and                 
              memory, and synapse formation and stabilization.  The long term                
              objective of this research is to understand the mechanisms of                  
              operation of synaptic ion channels, particulary, the processes of              
              ligand binding and channel gating.  The immediate goal of the                  
              research is to examine the activation mechanisms of synaptic                   
              receptors stimulated by glutamate.  By applying kinetic analyses,              
              Dr. Auerbach will be able to investigate how agonists, glutamate-              
              like molecules, activate NMDA ion channels, regulate the gating                
              of channel pores and the desensitization of NMDA receptors. In                 
              addition, the developmental changes in NMDA activated channels                 
              will be studied.  The Principal investigator has developed a                   
              method of applying agonist by diffusion through the back of a                  
              pipette, a powerful technique which will enable the PI to                      
              obtained data from a single channel over a range of                            
              concentrations.  Experimentally, this approach will allow for the              
              study of ligand activated channels in their native cellular                    
              environment.  Results of this investigation will contribute to                 
              the understanding of the mechanisms of how the glutamate                       
              neurotransmitter operates and will provide a microscopic                       
              description of synaptic transmission.
