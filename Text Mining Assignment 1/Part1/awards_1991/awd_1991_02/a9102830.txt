Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This award is to the Cornell National Supercomputer Facility (CNSF)            
              in collaboration with the NAtional Center for Supercomputing                   
              Applications (NCSA) and the University of Alabama at Huntsville for            
              the 1991-1994 SuperQuest Program.  This is a three year continuing             
              award to support the integration of computational science and its              
              tools into the high school science and mathematics curriculum.  A              
              national competition for high school students and teachers was                 
              held.  These students proposed the investigation of a scientific               
              problem and its solution using supercomputing resources.  Judging              
              was based on scientific content, effectiveness of computational                
              approach, creativity and clarity.  The proposals were eleven                   
              winning teams attending CNSF; for teams at NCSA and three teams at             
              the University of Alabama.  Each team will consist of three-four               
              students and a teacher.  The proposed topics range from the                    
              extinction of the dinosaurs to a study of traffic jams to                      
              preserving organs at low temperatures.  The SuperQuest teams will              
              receive training in basic supercomputer usage, programming                     
              languages, computer graphics and basic numerical methods.  They                
              will be aided by supercomputer experts in developing and                       
              implementing their programs on the centers' supercomputers.                    
              Workstations will be donated to the schools and the winning teams              
              will receive technical assistance in setting up the remote                     
              computing sites.  The students will deliver scientific talks on                
              their projects at professional scientific meetings.
