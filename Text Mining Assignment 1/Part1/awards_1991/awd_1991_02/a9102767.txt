Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Since its origin in the late Pleistocene, Emiliania huxleyi has                
              become ubiquitous in the world's oceans.  It is the most abundant              
              living coccolithophore and the most important organism in the                  
              transfer of atmospheric carbon dioxide to the ocean sediments.                 
              Morphological forms include coccolith-bearing and naked coccoid                
              cells, and scaled flagellates.  Only the coccolith-bearing                     
              morphotype is readily idnetifiable in natural samples, and all                 
              studies to date on the distribution and abundance of the species               
              have been studies of only this morphotype.  Comparison to other                
              coccolithophores suggests the motile form is an alternate life                 
              cycle stage, but the life cycle of Emilianian hyxleyi remains                  
              poorly understood, and its role in bloom dynamics is unknown.                  
              Recently developed techniques permit identificaiton and tracking               
              of naked and flagellated Emiliiania huxleyi cells in natural                   
              populations and simplify determination of ploidy in cultured                   
              cells.  The objectives of this research are (1) to compare the                 
              abundances and distributions of the flagellated form to that of                
              the coccoid forms in natural populations before, during and after              
              blooms, (2) to estabilish ploidy and the life history, and thus                
              (3) to determine the role of the flagellated form, and of sexual               
              recombination, in bloom dynamics.
