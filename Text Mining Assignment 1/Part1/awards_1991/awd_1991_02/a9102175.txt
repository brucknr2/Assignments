Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  Lavas exposed by the Blanco Trough provide an opportunity                 
              to constrain the dynamic nature of magmatic systems beneath                    
              mid-ocean ridge propagating rifts. This project will complete                  
              trace element analyses of a suite of lavas collected from the                  
              Blanco Trough during cruises in 1987 and 1989. In addition,                    
              the principal investigator will participate on a 30-day                        
              French Nautile dive program in the Blanco Trough. Petrologic data              
              from these lavas will be used to model the melting and                         
              crystalization history that has occurred at the spreading center               
              during different stages in the evolution of the magmatic                       
              systems associated with a propagating rift.
