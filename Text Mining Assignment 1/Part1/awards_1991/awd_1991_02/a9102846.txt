Abstract    :
              The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution will upgrade the                      
              nine year-old mass spectrometer serving a number of                            
              investigators in its Geology & Geophysics Department.  The                     
              existing VG Micromass 602E requires a new source and is no                     
              longer serviced by the manufacturer.  The upgrade will                         
              involve converting the machine to a triple collector with a                    
              new high sensitivity source, including new magnets and flight                  
              tube.  New micro inlet valves will also be developed and                       
              installed.  A forty-sample carousel system will be                             
              implemented using pneumatic valves and proven control and                      
              data acquisition software.  The upgrade will have several                      
              benefits beyond more reliable operation.  Automation will                      
              enhance productivity and sample throughput over present                        
              manual operation, and will reduce operating errors.  Higher                    
              sensitivity and a smaller inlet volume will also allow                         
              analysis of smaller sized samples.  Over the years, the                        
              present machine has been in continuous operation in support                    
              of numerous NSF-sponsored oceanographic, earth, and                            
              atmospheric studies.  This pattern of heavy use is expected                    
              to continue.
