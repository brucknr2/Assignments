Abstract    :
              This award will support a U.S.-Italy Workshop on asphaltic                     
              materials.  The activity is being organized by Professor Paul                  
              Jennings of Montana State University and Professor Carlo                       
              Giavarini of the University of Rome.  The subject of the                       
              workshop will be restricted to the chemical components of                      
              bitumens and the ways in which the components interact in the                  
              neat asphalt.  The agenda includes presentation of research                    
              results and new techniques for achieving such results, and                     
              allows ample time for discussion and exchange of ideas.                        
                                                                                             
              Although asphaltic materials (bitumens) have been used                         
              extensively around the world for roadway paving, for roofing                   
              and for other purposes, the chemistry of these materials,                      
              which determines their behavior, has been poorly understood.                   
              However, research in this area has been gaining momentum                       
              rapidly and interchange of information and ideas among                         
              scientists from different countries will play an important                     
              role in future efforts.  This workshop will permit a rapid                     
              exchange of information among the participants, thus                           
              promoting progress in individual research.  Furthermore, the                   
              proceedings of the conference, including all presentations and                 
              transcriptions of discussions, will be published and                           
              disseminated not only among the participants but also to                       
              other interested scientists.
