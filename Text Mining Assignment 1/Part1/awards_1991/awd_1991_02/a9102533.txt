Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                     Although the general concept of linear magnetic anomalies              
              generated by seafloor spreading processes at the ridge crest is                
              well established, the source of the magnetization within the                   
              ocean crest remains uncertain. Samples obtained during ALVIN                   
              dives in the Hess Deep comprise a range of differentiated                      
              tholeiitic extrusives, dikes and gabbros that represent a section              
              through the upper gabbroic crustal layer, 700 m of sheeted dikes,              
              and about 300 m of crustal pillow.lava sequence. The intention is              
              to acquire a full suite of rock magnetic measurements on coarse                
              and fine.grained rocks of different compositions, representing                 
              different levels of the upper ocean crust, and integrate these                 
              with the crystallization and alteration histories of the rocks,                
              as well as the compositions of magnetic minerals.
