Abstract    :
                   The objective of this research is to study high level global              
              path planning and dispatching of multiple vehicles using                       
              statistical models and graph representation techniques and a low               
              level multi-sensor based local path planning and navigation system.            
              These efforts will support the development of a complex                        
              manufacturing floor material handling system using guide path                  
              independent autonomous vehicles.                                               
                   Particular efforts to be emphasized in this project include               
              development of a geometric representation of the factory floor and             
              a graph representation of the paths in a factory; development of               
              vehicle dispatching techniques and a collision avoidance strategy;             
              and the development of an onboard Hierarchical Mutiprocessor                   
              Computer System to support real time operation of an intelligent               
              mobile robot. The design and implementation of an experimental                 
              system to test the proposed approaches will also be pursued.
