Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Support is provided for the 1991 Gordon Conference, July 29-August             
              2, 1991.  The subject, development of microstructure and the                   
              processes that control it, is part of the foundation of physical               
              metallurgy.  It is a continually evolving area dependent on                    
              advanced characterization techniques, theoretical modeling and                 
              analyses, and the stimulus of new and advanced materials.                      
              This conference zeros in on the subject from a unified perspective.            
                                                                                             
              It ties together theoretical modeling and analysis, ideal systems,             
              real systems, and current limitations in predictive capability and             
              processing control.  It is an ideal forum to discuss the new NSF               
              initiative on synthesis and processing, which has direct ties to               
              microstructure development.
