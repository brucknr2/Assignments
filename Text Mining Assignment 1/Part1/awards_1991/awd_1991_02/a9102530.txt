Abstract    :
                   Baum is currently working on five projects:                                
                                                                                            
              (1)  K-homology and C*-algebra K-theory (with A. Connes).                      
                                                                                             
              (2)  Intersection theory and bivariant K-theory (with J.                       
                   Block)                                                                    
                                                                                             
              (3)  Cyclic homology and higher Riemann-Roch (with J.  Block).                 
                                                                                             
              (4)  Equivariant index theory for proper actions of discrete                   
                   groups (with M. Davis and C. Ogle).                                       
                                                                                             
              (5)  Index theory on compact C-infinity manifolds with                         
                   boundary (with R. Douglas and M. Taylor).                                 
                                                                                             
                   It is hard to characterize these topics as falling within                 
              one area of mathematics.  (1) combines algebraic topology and                  
              modern analysis.  (2) is more algebra and algebraic geometry.                  
              (3)  combines algebraic topology and algebraic geometry.  (4) and              
              (5)  combine analysis and algebraic topology.  To the extent that              
              there are applications of Baum's work, they are now mostly  to                 
              other parts of mathematics.  It is clear that these applications               
              are very widely distributed within mathematics, however.
