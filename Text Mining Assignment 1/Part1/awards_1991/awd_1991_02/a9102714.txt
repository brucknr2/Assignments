Abstract    :
              Since the identification and control of unknown                                
              stochastic systems is a basic problem in control                               
              theory, we intend to continue our research on                                  
              stochastic adaptive control.  We intend to study more                          
              extensively the adaptive control of partially observed,                        
              linear, finite dimensional stochastic systems based on                         
              our previous work.  Some related problems of                                   
              adaptive control for study are approximations to self-                         
              optimizing adaptive controls identification of time-                           
              varying parameters and asymptotic distributions.
