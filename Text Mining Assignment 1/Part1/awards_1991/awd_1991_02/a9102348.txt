Abstract    :
              This exploratory study under an SGER award will attempt to                     
              deposit beta-C3N4 on metal substrates.  The compound's                         
              existence has been predicted from theoretical considerations                   
              which also indicate that it may be harder than diamond.                        
              Deposition by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition                        
              techniques will be attempted on the (0001) faces of single                     
              crystals of Hf and Zr, which closely match the crystal                         
              structure of the compound and also have strong bonds with                      
              both carbon and nitrogen.  The resultant coatings will be                      
              characterized by crystallographic, metallographic and                          
              tribological techniques.
