Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will study whether the analog of               
              the strong law of large numbers holds for reinforced random walk               
              on the integers, whenever the initial weightings are equal, under              
              arbitrary past dependent reinforcement.  He also will investigate              
              recurrence of two dimensional, and n dimensional, reinforced                   
              random walk.  In addition, he proposes to find necessary and                   
              sufficient geometrical conditions for certain classes of domains,              
              including the class of those domains in R**2 with boundary in a                
              sense given locally by the graph of a function, for the semigroup              
              connected with the Dirichlet Laplacian to be intrinsically                     
              ultracontractive.                                                              
                   The principal investigator will conduct research at the                   
              interface between probability and analysis.  He will work on two               
              classes of problems:  reinforced random walk, and intrinsic                    
              ultracontractivity.
