Abstract    :
                   An important new technique for probing the middle atmosphere              
              is the use of short, powerful bursts of laser light for the                    
              detection and ranging of scattering from atmospheric molecules                 
              and aerosols. The technique is called LIDAR, and is very similar               
              to the familiar RADAR technique. This award supports improvement               
              and testing of the newly developed LIDAR system that the PI has                
              designed for studies of the upper and middle atmosphere. In                    
              particular, new detector channels will by added to extend the                  
              altitude range of the system, and to increase the number of                    
              properties that can be measured simultaneously with the system.                
              The results are expected to lead particularly to improved                      
              performance for middle atmosphere applications. As part of the                 
              testing efforts it is anticipated that a significant data set                  
              will be obtained for use in investigating atmospheric properties.
