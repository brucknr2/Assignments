Abstract    :
              This is an investigation of the dispersion of modifiers                        
              (potassium and copper) in supported ruthenium catalysts using                  
              steady-state isotopic transient kinetic analysis (SSITKA) of                   
              the ethane hydrogenolysis reaction.  Since this reaction is                    
              highly structure sensitive, it can be used to detect modifier-                 
              induced disruptions in the surface of the active metal.  In                    
              fact, from isotopic transients, it is possible to determine                    
              directly how the modifier adspecies affects the population of                  
              active ensemble sites.  Along with the interpretation of                       
              SSITKA-derived reactivity distributions of these sites, the                    
              project addresses fundamental questions regarding modifier                     
              location and modifier dispersion.                                              
                                                                                             
              Catalyst promoters are often used to improve activities and                    
              selectivities of industrial catalysts.  Despite their wide                     
              use, the nature of their influence is unknown, resulting in a                  
              lack of a rational basis for selection of modifiers.
