Abstract    :
              Long & Medium-Term Research:  Magnetic Recording Research                       
                                                                                            
              This award is made under the Program for Long & Medium-Term                    
              Research at Foreign Centers of Excellence, which enables                       
              U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to twelve                       
              months abroad at research centers of proven excellence.  The                   
              program's awards provide opportunities for joint research,                     
              and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise                   
              and experimental conditions abroad.                                            
                                                                                             
              This award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research                   
              visit by Jay R. Hoinville of Washington University with D.J.                   
              Mapps of the School of Electronic, Communication, and                          
              Electrical Engineering of Polytechnic South West, Devon,                       
              United Kingdom.  The researchers will investigate magnetic                     
              recording by developing and characterizing new recording                       
              head technologies.  The size of a recorded bit cell depends                    
              on the size of the recording head and on the spacing between                   
              the medium and the head.  By taking advantage of the                           
              benefits of reduction of geometric scale, the researchers                      
              hope to develop recording heads which produce areal densities                  
              on the order of 1Mbit/mm2.  They propose to develop a head                     
              which can be used to read/write in contact with the medium                     
              and which has a tract width of 1um.                                            
                                                                                             
              The award recommendation provides funds to cover international                 
              travel and a flat administrative allowance of $250 for the                     
              U.S. home institution.
