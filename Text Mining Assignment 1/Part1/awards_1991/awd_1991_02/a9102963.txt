Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              With the availability of advanced computing facilities and the                 
              improvement of the environment of floating point arithmetic, there is          
              a need and an opportunity for further development and analysis of              
              accurate, stable and efficient numerical solutions for many                    
              numerical linear algebra problems.  This proposal is concerned with            
              several fundamental matrix computation problems, such as computing             
              eigenvalues of large nonsymmetric matrices, computing invariant                
              subspaces with specific spectra, estimating condition numbers of the           
              nonsymmetric eigenvalue problem, and computing the generalized QR              
              factorization and the generalized singular value decomposition.  The           
              goal of the research is to develop efficient algorithms and portable           
              software for high- performance computers, motivated by many                    
              applications of these problems in scientific computing and other               
              areas of numerical analysis.
