Abstract    :
                   Santa Clara University requests support from NSF for                      
              connection of its campus network to BARRnet.  BARRnet is the                   
              midlevel network located in the Bay Area of California.  It will               
              provide operations management and information services and it                  
              will give Santa Clara University a medium speed connection                     
              (56,000 bits per second) to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45                 
              million bits per second) National Backbone network.                            
                   The University needs greater functionality and network speed              
              to be able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file                  
              transfers along with being able to implement a more reliable mail              
              system. Students and faculty research will benefit from the link.              
              This is also a unique opportunity for the school to explore                    
              innovative educational resources.
