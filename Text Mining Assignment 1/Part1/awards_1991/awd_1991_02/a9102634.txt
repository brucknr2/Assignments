Abstract    :
              Funds are requested for a Small Grants for Exploratory Research                
              award to study the fast transient photoinduced conductivity and                
              photoinduced absorption of materials from the family of high                   
              temperature superconducting oxides.  Photoinduced absorption                   
              studies in this researcher's laboratory have already demonstrated              
              carriers on the copper oxide planes are polarons and large                     
              transient decreases in the resistivity of single crystals of                   
              yttrium-barium cuprate have been observed.  The proposed research              
              will search for experimental evidence of the relevence of the                  
              polarons to the mechanism of superconductivity.  The level of                  
              excitation will be sufficiently high to approach a photoinduced                
              metallic state and photoinduced superconductivity.
