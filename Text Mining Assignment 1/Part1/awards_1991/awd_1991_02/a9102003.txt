Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will continue his research in the              
              area of probability theory that treats sums of independent,                    
              identically distributed (iid) random variables.  This is a                     
              classical area of research, with applications to statistics as                 
              well as other areas of probability.  The investigator will work                
              on several problems:  large deviation estimates for the                        
              probability that the sum of iid random variables is small in                   
              absolute value, the rate of escape problem for random walk, limit              
              theorems for trimmed sums.
