Abstract    :
              The Department of Environmental, Population, and Organismic                    
              Biology requests 50% of the necessary funds to purchase an                     
              ultracentrifuge capable of performing macromolecular separations               
              (Sorvall OTD 60B).  The ultracentrifuge will serve the needs of                
              three separate research laboratories.  Two of these laboratories               
              require an ultracentrifuge for molecular systematics, and                      
              particularly for the isolation of chloroplast DNA from whole                   
              cells.  A third laboratory requires an ultracentrifuge for                     
              characterizing polyribosomes that may be important in anabolic                 
              processes that control dormancy in invertebrates and for the                   
              preparation of purified filamentous actin that may perform                     
              regulatory functions in catabolic processes related to                         
              invertebrate dormancy.
