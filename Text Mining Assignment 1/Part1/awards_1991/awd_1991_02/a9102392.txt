Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A theoretical study of the dynamics of tropical instability waves              
              (TIW) is proposed.  The investigation will involve two numerical               
              models, a reduced gravity model and a spectral process model.                  
              The sensitivity of the wave dynamics to the model's                            
              parameterizations of physical processes will be investigated.                  
              The dynamics of TIW and their relevance to the equatorial budgets              
              of heat, momentum, vorticity and energy will be evaluated.
