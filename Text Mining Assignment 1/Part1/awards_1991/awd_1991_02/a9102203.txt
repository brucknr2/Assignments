              Mosquitoes                                                                     
                                                                                             
              This award will provide supplementary support to enable Dr.                    
              Scott Hanson of the University of Notre Dame to conduct                        
              collaborative research with Dr. Mitsuo Takahashi for 24                        
              months at Japan's National Institute of Health in Tokyo.                       
              Utilizing Dr. Hanson's method of testing mosquito eggs for                     
              their cold hardiness and Dr. Takahashi's expertise on Aedes                    
              mosquitoes, the team will study the developmental physiology                   
              and genetics of Aedes mosquitoes.                                              
                                                                                             
              The Aedes albopictus mosquito, a carrier and transmitter of                    
              dengue fever, Venezuelan Equine encephalitis, La Crosse                        
              encephalitis, and many other Asian and New World diseases,                     
              was recently introduced to the North and South American                        
              Continents.  Almost all efforts to control its spread in the                   
              Americas have been unsuccessful.  In order to determine how                    
              far north in North America this mosquito can become es-                        
              tablished, it is important to study how hardy the eggs of                      
              this mosquito are in colder climates.  Hanson and Takahashi                    
              plan to focus their research on the cold hardiness of                          
              different strains of Aedes albopictus and to genetically                       
              analyze the mode of inheritance of cold hardiness for this                     
              mosquito.
