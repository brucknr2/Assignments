Abstract    :
              Recent work on representation of both casual relations and                     
              statistical relations by directed independence graphs, and even                
              more recent discoveries concerning search algorithms, offer the                
              prospect of automated systems that will reliably extract causal                
              information from large data bases, even when the number of                     
              variables is a hundred or more, and even when there is very                    
              little prior knowledge about the causal relations underlying the               
              data.  This work will systematically test the reliability of new               
              search algorithms on simulated data to study the extension of                  
              graph representation to feedback processes using cyclic graphs,                
              and to investigate the possibility of reliable automated                       
              dependencies in a data base.  Reliable algorithms for inferring                
              causal structure from statistical data will have widespread                    
              applications in engineering, epidemiology, the social sciences,                
              and any other discipline where experimental controls are often                 
              limited or absent.//
