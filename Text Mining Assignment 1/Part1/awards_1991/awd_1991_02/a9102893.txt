Abstract    :
                   Professor Beckmann will work on the arithmetic of branched                
              coverings of curves.  She hopes to describe arithmetic coverings               
              of the projective line defined over number fields in terms of                  
              branch cycle descriptions of the coverings.  In particular, she                
              hopes to describe the ramification properties of field extensions              
              derived from these coverings.                                                  
                   This project falls into the general area of arithmetic                    
              geometry -a subject that blends two of the oldest areas of                     
              mathematics: number theory and geometry.  This combination has                 
              proved extraordinarily fruitful - having recently solved problems              
              that withstood generations.  Among its many consequences are new               
              error correcting codes.  Such codes are essential for both modern              
              computers (hard disks) and compact disks.
