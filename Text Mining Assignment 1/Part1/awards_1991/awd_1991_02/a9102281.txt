Abstract    :
              The Department of Chemistry at Kansas State University will use                
              this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program                 
              to help acquire a mass spectrometer system.  The areas of                      
              chemical research that will enhance by the acquisition include                 
              the following:  1)  Diels - Alder Chemistry of Activated                       
              Cyclobutenes, 2)  Asymmetric Synthesis of Natural Products and                 
              Molecules of Biomedical Interest, 3)  Organic Molecule                         
              Fragmentations on the Surfaces of Nano-scale Metal Oxide                       
              Particles, 4)  Performance of SMAD Catalysts Organic Precursors                
              to Carbon Monosulfide (CS),  5)  p-Phenylenediimido-Bridged                    
              Dimers and Polymers.  A New Class of Conjugated Inorganic                      
              Systems, and 6)  Toward a Hydrocarbon Ferromagnet:                             
              Polyarylmethyls.                                                               
                                                                                             
              Mass spectrometry is a technique used to probe intimate                        
              structural details and to obtain the molecular compositions of                 
              a vast array of organic, bioorganic and organometallic                         
              molecules.  When combined with a high performance liquid                       
              chromatograph, the resulting system affords the chemist one of                 
              the most powerful tools available for the separation and                       
              characterization of compounds.  The acquisition of a mass                      
              spectrometer is essential for the prosecution of frontier                      
              research in many fields of chemistry.
