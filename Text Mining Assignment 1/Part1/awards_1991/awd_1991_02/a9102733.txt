Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This mainly field program will examine the dynamics, both fluid                
              and sediment, within the swash zone on a steep beach.  The net                 
              sediment transport is expected to be determined by a balance                   
              between infragravity and incident wave energies.  These will be                
              modified by microtopography on the beach face.
