Abstract    :
                   This award supports the research of Professor A. Pizer to                 
              work on the connections between modular forms, quaternion                      
              algebras, and Ramanujan graphs.  He intends to investigate the                 
              extremal properties of Ramanujan graphs constructed via modular                
              forms.                                                                         
                   Modular forms arose out of Non-Euclidean geometry in the                  
              middle of the nineteenth century.  Combinatorics, on the other                 
              hand, represents a systematization of the first mathematical                   
              activity, counting.  The recently discovered connections between               
              these two areas demonstrates once again how modern mathematics                 
              progresses by connecting together seemingly diverse fields.  This              
              research is potentially important in communications and                        
              information technology.
