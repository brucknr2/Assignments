Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                     This is a two.leg six ALVIN dive cruise to conduct a program           
              of instrument deployment, mapping of flow related patterns near                
              the seafloor, and in situ and laboratory califbration of a new                 
              suite of sensitive seafloor hydrothermal instrumentation. The                  
              program will collect continuous time series diffuse hydrothermal               
              flow rates and temperatures over a period of about 40 days. A                  
              mappling program using similar instrumentation will examine flow               
              both out of and into cracks and fissures in the bassltic basement              
              rock in the vicinity of the vent field.
