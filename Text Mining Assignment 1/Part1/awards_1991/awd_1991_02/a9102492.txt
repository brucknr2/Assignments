Abstract    :
              This proposal is aimed at the synthesis of new quaternary oxides in            
              molten hydroxide fluxes, and a study of the reaction conditions                
              that favor certain structural features in the solids as they                   
              crystallize.  The development of practical synthetic routes that               
              result in materials which exhibit specific properties and which are            
              therefore more amenable to processing is the ultimate goal of the              
              project.  Initial studies will focus on the preparation of new,                
              high-temperature superconducting quaternary metal cuprates,                    
              bismuthates, and niobates using molten alkali metal and/or alkaline            
              earth metal hydroxides as solvents.
