Abstract    :
              Irwin         The primary thrust of the research is the investigation of a  more
              general purpose signal processing architecture which  achieves the same level
              of performance as special-purpose signal  processing architectures without an
              accompanying increase in  granularity.  Most attempts at trying to expand an
              architecture  to accommodate a more general class of applications usually 
              result in an increase in granularity.  With the increase in  granularity either
              the overall size of the processor increases  or, to keep the overall physical
              size constant, fewer processing  cells are utilized.  In either case, the end
              result is a decrease  in performance.  This project attempts the development of
              more  general purpose signal processing architectures which avoid this 
              difficulty while maintaining the granularity, performance, and  physical size
              of fine grain processors with the flexibility of  more coarse grain processors.
