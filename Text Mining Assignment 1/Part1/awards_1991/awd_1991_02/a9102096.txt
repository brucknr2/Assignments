Abstract    :
                   This project funds the participation of 28 minority                       
              faculty at the ACM CSC 91 and SIGCSE 91 conferences to be                      
              held in San Antonio, TX, March 5-9, 1991. There is a number                    
              of planned special activities which are important to minority                  
              faculty, particularly those from minority institutions.                        
              Among the planned activities are (1) special sessions                          
              addressing unique programs for minorities, (2) panels                          
              addressing federal funding possibilities for minority                          
              research programs, (3) an employment register, (4) graduate                    
              schools describing opportunities for minorities, and (5) a                     
              special session in the chairs' program addressing problems                     
              associated with administering a computer science program at a                  
              minority institution.                                                          
                   This project funds the participation of 28 minority                       
              faculty at the ACM CSC 91 and SIGCSE 91 conferences to be                      
              held in San Antonio, TX, March 5-9, 1991.  It is important                     
              that minority faculty attend national conferences in order to                  
              become better integrated into the research and education                       
              communities.  This project represents a strong effort in that                  
              direction.
