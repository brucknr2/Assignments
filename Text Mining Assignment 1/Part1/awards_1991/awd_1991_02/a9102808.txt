Abstract    :
                   The Fellow will develop a three-dimensional model that can                
              test hypotheses related to the distribution of hotspots and the                
              nature of the mid-ocean ridges.  Hotspots distribution is effected             
              by plate motions and may congregate near regions of divergent flow             
              analogues to mid-ocean ridges.  The mid-ocean ridges are either                
              dynamical features of upwellings that have deep mantle origins, or             
              passive, local, shallow upwellings, induced by divergences in the              
              plate velocity field.  The Fellow will work at the University of               
              Michigan during his tenure.
