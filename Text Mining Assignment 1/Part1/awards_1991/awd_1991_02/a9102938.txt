Abstract    :
              This is research aims at the development of constraint imperative              
              programming languages for building interactive systems.  A                     
              constraint language allows the programmer to specify relations                 
              that are to be maintained by the underlying system.  The                       
              development of a constraint imperative programming (CIP) approach              
              has been developed to integrate the constraint and imperative                  
              paradigms.  This work will attempt to improve exiting speed by                 
              development of a compiler for object-oriented CIP languages to                 
              produce efficient code.  The research will investigate how the                 
              sequence of actions to be taken for a given user input can be                  
              represented in a constraint imperative environment.  The work                  
              will include the investigation of tools for writing, browsing and              
              debugging constraint imperative programs.
