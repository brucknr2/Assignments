Abstract    :
              The objective of this proposal is to study the development                     
              of concentrated flow channels in the soils when flow                           
              velocity exceeds a critical value in order to have a better                    
              understanding about the  behavior of very soft soils during                    
              consolidation.  The formation of flow channels could                           
              invalidate the application of consolidation theory to these                    
              cases and potentially could have a beneficial effect by                        
              increasing the hydraulic conductivity and accelerating the                     
              consolidation process.
