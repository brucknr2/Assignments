              Geological Sample Storage facilities provide important and                     
              essential services to the geological research community. The core              
              repository facility at Oregon State University, Department of                  
              Oceanography is being funded to archive cores and other                        
              geological rock samples from the seafloor and provide the                      
              important  services of sample distribution and related data                    
              dissemination to the marine geologica, sedimentological and                    
              paleoceanographic communities.
