Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a study of the synthesis and processing of novel mixed                 
              oxide sol-gel derived ceramics. The research involves a                        
              comprehensive examination of the fundamental processes controlling             
              the simultaneous hydrolysis of precursors, the kinetics of gelation            
              and gel to ceramic conversion, as well as the characterization of              
              the microstructure and electrical properties of the final products.            
              For the synthesis of the precursors the co-hydrolysis of different             
              alkoxides will be controlled through the modification of their                 
              molecular structure. The objective of studying the gelation and                
              conversion processes is to establish the relationship between the              
              molecular structure of precursors, the structure of the resulting              
              gels, and the structure of the intermediate crystallites during                
              conversion. A fundamental understanding of the sol-gel process will            
              lead to new and improved ceramics for electronic and structural                
              applications.
