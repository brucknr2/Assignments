Abstract    :
              Funds are requested for the purchase of an X-band Bruker ESP 300-              
              10/12 electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrometer with a                
              liquid helium temperature cryostat.  EPR spectroscopy is an                    
              essential component of four biochemical/biophysical research                   
              programs in the Chemistry Department and Center for Metalloenzyme              
              Studies at the University of Georgia, all of which focus on the                
              role of transition metals in metalloenzymes and metalloproteins.               
              The requested spectrometer will facilitate EPR studies of Fe-S                 
              clusters in the mitochondrial respiratory chain and at the active              
              sites of range of different metalloenzymes, binuclear Fe centers               
              in hemerythrin and rubreythrin, binuclear Mn centers in                        
              ribonucleotide reductase, the Ni-containing F 430 cofactor of S-               
              methyl coenzyme M reductase, and Co in Co(II)-substituted alcohol              
              dehydrogenases.  The proposed instrument will be used for                      
              training and research directly related to the NSF research                     
              training group in the role of transition metals in biology at the              
              University of Georgia.
