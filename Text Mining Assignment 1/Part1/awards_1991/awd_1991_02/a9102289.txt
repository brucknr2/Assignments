Abstract    :
              This program at Iowa State develops a symbiotic relationship with              
              other similar programs to enlarge the scope of the effort.  The                
              students work with students supported by the Department of                     
              Education Undergraduate Research Opportunities for Minorities as               
              well as the NSF Minority Scholars program.  These students work on             
              continuing and new projects in a) Advanced silicon processing for              
              devices and integrated circuits, b) High-power and high-frequency              
              bipolar transistors and other microwave devices, c) III-V compound             
              quantum nanostructures, d) Non-crystalline silicon structures for              
              energy conversion, e) Basic semiconductor material studies and f)              
              ASIC design for high-frequency circuits and systems.  They work on             
              these projects full time during the summer and, if Iowa State                  
              University students, part time during the academic year. The                   
              program cooperates with State University of New York - New Paltz,              
              Lincoln University, and North Carolina A & T.  A microelectronics              
              fabrication course is offered each summer with teaching                        
              responsibilities shared by all four participating faculty.  Non-               
              ISU students are able to transfer the course credits to their home             
              institutions.  It is expected that a number of the research-trained            
              and motivated students will continue into graduate studies at ISU              
              and elsewhere; consequently there is an active recruitment for                 
              graduate students interested in microelectronics and photonics from            
              the program participants.
