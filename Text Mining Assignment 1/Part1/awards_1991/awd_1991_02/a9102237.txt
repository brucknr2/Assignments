Abstract    :
                   This proposal is for the establishment of a modern digital                
              ionosonde in Argentina at the approximate location of the                      
              magnetic conjugate point of the Arecibo Observatory.  After the                
              ionosonde is operating, simultaneous measurements at both ends of              
              the field line will be made.***
