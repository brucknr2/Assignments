Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              It is proposed to run an eddy-resolving primitive equation                     
              numerical model to examine the influence of outcropping on mid-                
              latitude jet separation.  The effect of seasonal heat flux                     
              variation on outcropping will be examined.  Realistic wind                     
              forcing will be achieved by adding a thermodynamically active top              
              layer.
