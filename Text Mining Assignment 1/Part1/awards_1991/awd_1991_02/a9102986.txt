Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research project examines two areas where ion implantation can            
              be employed to improve surface properties, oxidation of nickel-                
              chromium alloys and corrosion of stainless steels.  It is believed             
              that the implantation creates a one-thousand Angstrom layer that is            
              amorphous on these alloys.  Implanting yttrium ions into nickel-               
              chromium alloys improves the resistance to oxidation, and the                  
              mechanisms of this improvement are under investigation.                        
              Phosphorous ion implantation of stainless steel produces an                    
              amorphous layer over a very narrow range of fluences.  The extent              
              to which the improved corrosion resistance depends on homogeneity              
              of the amorphous phase and on small amounts of second phases that              
              form is under study.  Transmission electron microscopy is used in              
              both instances to examine the structure of the implanted layers,               
              recrystallization tendencies, chemistry, and defect structures.                
              %%%                                                                            
              Ion implantation can be used to create microstructures and chemical            
              distributions not attainable by other means.  This project should              
              clarify the mechanisms by which surface ion implantation can be                
              employed to improve oxidation and corrosion resistance of metal                
              alloys.
