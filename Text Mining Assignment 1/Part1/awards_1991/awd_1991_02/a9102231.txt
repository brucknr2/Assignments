Abstract    :
              Broadcast and Multicast are paradigms that are central to many state-          
              of-the-art fault-tolerant distributed systems.  Despite their                  
              fundamental importance, these paradigms are not yet completely                 
              understood.  Many of their aspects are still unexplored and many               
              crucial issues remain to be solved.  The goal of this research is to           
              develop a deeper understanding of the foundations of fault-tolerant            
              broadcasts and multicasts.  The work will focus on Reliable Broadcast,         
              Causal Broadcast and Atomic Broadcast and the corresponding multicast          
              formulations.  The investigation will include the following problems           
              in the context of several types of failure models and communication            
              networks:  (1) development of specifications, algorithms, and lower            
              bounds for the new problem of preventing inconsistency and                     
              contamination via broadcasts and multicasts initiated by faulty                
              processes.  (2) development of algorithms and lower bounds for Causal          
              Broadcasts and Multicasts.  (3) development of Reliable and Atomic             
              Broadcast    protocols that are simultaneously time-efficient and              
              message-efficient, with a performance that gracefully degrades as the          
              number of failures that actually occur increases.
