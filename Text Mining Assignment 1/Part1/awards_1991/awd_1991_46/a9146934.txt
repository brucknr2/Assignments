Abstract    :
                   This proposal is for the first year of a three-year continuing            
              award for the Evaluator function for two I/UCRCs located in the                
              State of Washington.  One is the Center for Process Analytical                 
              Chemistry at the University of Washington and the other is the                 
              Center for Design of Analog/Digital Integrated Circuits at                     
              Washington State University.  The evaluator is a position required             
              by NSF for all I/UCRCs and is responsible for  the implementation              
              of the Centers' assessment program.  The assessment program                    
              identifies the factors that will contribute to the attainment of               
              the Centers' goals.                                                            
                   The Program Director recommends that Craig Scott be awarded               
              $14,000 for the first year of a three-year continuing award.
