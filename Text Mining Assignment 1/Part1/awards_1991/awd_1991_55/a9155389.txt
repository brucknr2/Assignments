Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal provides for the establishment of a                              
              partnership program between Rice University and the Houston                    
              Independent School District (HISD) together with businesses                    
              and industry to enhance the scientific skills of teachers at                   
              the middle school level.  The program calls for the                            
              establishment of Resident Teachers positions to be filled by                   
              qualified HISD candidates.  These teachers will be involved                    
              in enrichment programs that will provide them with exposure                    
              to modern scientific and technical materials and knowledge,                    
              businesses and industry applications, and up-to-date                           
              educational theory.  Three hundred middle school teachers                      
              will participate in this teacher enhancement program.                          
                                                                                             
              Cost sharing is equivalent to 120% of the NSF award.
