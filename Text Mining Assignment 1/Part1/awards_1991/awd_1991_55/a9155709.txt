Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Digital image processing offers several possible new                           
              approaches to the teaching of a variety of mathematical                        
              concepts at the middle-school and high-school levels.  There                   
              is reason to believe that this approach will be successful                     
              in reaching some "at-risk" students that other approaches                      
              miss.  Since digital images can be made to reflect almost                      
              any aspect of the real world, some students may have an                        
              easier time taking an interest in them than they might with                    
              artificial figures or images resulting from other graphics-                    
              oriented approaches.  Using computer-based tools such as                       
              image processing operators, curve-fitting operators, shape                     
              analysis operators, and graphical synthesis, students may                      
              explore a world of mathematical concepts starting from the                     
              psychologically "safe" territory of their own physical and                     
              cultural environments.  There is reason to hope that this                      
              approach will be particularly successful with students from                    
              diverse backgrounds, girls and members of minority groups,                     
              because the imagery used in experiments can easily be                          
              tailored to individual tastes.  The work of the project                        
              consists of creating detailed designs of the learning                          
              modules, implementing them on microcomputers, and evaluating                   
              their effectiveness in a variety of ways, using trials with                    
              students at Rainier Beach High School, which is an urban                       
              public high school having an ethnically diverse student body                   
              and a Macintosh computer laboratory.
