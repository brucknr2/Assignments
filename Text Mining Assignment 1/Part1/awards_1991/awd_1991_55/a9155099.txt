Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Northern Kentucky University will initiate a year-round Early Alert            
              Initiative Young Scholars project in Mathematics and Physics for 40            
              students entering grades 8 and 9; this will include a four-week                
              summer commuter program.                                                       
                                                                                             
              The summer component will focus on space and aeronautics with                  
              applied mathematics and physics activities related to this theme.              
              Students will work closely with a team of mathematicians and                   
              engineers testing materials in a wind tunnel, studying optics,                 
              making holograms, making a scale model of the solar system,                    
              controlling robots, and building model rockets.  The program will              
              increase the awareness and interest of junior high students in                 
              mathematics and physics as potential career options.
