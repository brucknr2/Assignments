Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The University of Alabama @ Huntsville will initiate a three-week,             
              residential Young Scholars project in Engineering which will offer             
              science enrichment activities for 30 precollege students entering              
              grades 10 and 11.                                                              
                                                                                             
              The program is entitled "Adventures in Engineering" and will offer             
              a broad exposure to electrical, civil and chemical/mechanical                  
              engineering.  The first two weeks consist of career exploration                
              activities, engineering ethics, the engineering method, intensive              
              coverage of course material (normally taught at the college                    
              sophomore level) and a variety of hands-on laboratory experiences.             
              The third week consists of additional career opportunity                       
              exploration, industrial tours and an intensive engineering design              
              experience in one of the three stressed areas of engineering,                  
              culminating in an oral presentation by each student on his design.
