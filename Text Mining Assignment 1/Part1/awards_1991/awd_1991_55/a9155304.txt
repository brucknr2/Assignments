Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                                                                                            
              This four year project will provide 685 middle school and                      
              high school mathematics teachers in four counties in South                     
              Carolina with seminars by nationally known speakers,                           
              inservice workshops, and academic year short courses. In                       
              addition, a three year series of intensive five week summer                    
              institutes will be offered for 48 leader teachers.  The                        
              seminar series and workshops are designed to build support                     
              among the teachers and in the community for excellence in                      
              mathematics and to enhance administrative awareness and                        
              support for the efforts.  The project is designed to                           
              determine effective strategies for developing teacher                          
              understanding mathematics, teacher and student abilities to                    
              communicate mathematics, and to involve students in the                        
              discovery of mathematics.  Course materials will be developed                  
              to aid in implementation of exemplary classroom teaching                       
              practices.
