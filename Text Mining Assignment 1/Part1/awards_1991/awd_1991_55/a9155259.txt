Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The purpose of this program, which builds upon the success of a                
              previous teacher enhancement effort, is to develop a leadership                
              program that can serve as a national model for dissemination of                
              knowledge and pedagological techniques in the subject areas of                 
              The Nature of Science and Evolution. The objectives of this                    
              program are 1) to improve the quality of instruction of the                    
              nature of science and evolution; 2) to encourage and enable                    
              biology teachers to begin with these matters and to integrate                  
              them throughout the biology course; 3) to demonstrate how the use              
              of humans as biological examples can enhance student interest and              
              learning; 4) to assist teachers in developing a more dynamic                   
              teaching methodology. Applications will emphasize a shift in                   
              laboratory focus toward exploratory activities. In addition the                
              use of cooperative learning, concept mapping, and textbooks as                 
              reference sources will be encouraged.                                          
                                                                                             
              Specifically, 890 teachers from the mid-western and western                    
              United States will participate in the program. The objectives                  
              will be accomplished by three distinct, but related, program                   
              elements.  First, 30 teachers per year will participate in an                  
              "Evolution and the Nature of Science Institute" (ENSI) and two                 
              followup sessions, to be held at San Jose State University (SJSU)              
              for the first three years of the program. Second, six teams of                 
              lead teachers will be selected and trained in a "Lead Teacher                  
              Preparation Program" (LTPP), during each of the first three years              
              of the program. Third, the lead teacher teams will present two-                
              week satellite ENSIs (SENSIs) during the second through fifth                  
              years of the programs. It is proposed that 40 SENSIs be held, for              
              twenty teachers each, at sites throughout the midwest and western              
              United States.                                                                 
                                                                                             
              The total cost share of this program is estimated to be 42 % of                
              NSF cost.
