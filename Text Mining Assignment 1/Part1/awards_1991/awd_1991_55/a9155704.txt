Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project seeks support to explore the results of trying                    
              alternative assessment items in the sciences, developed at the                 
              Science Teaching Center in Israel, with secondary school level                 
              students in the United States.  It will determine if more                      
              international cooperation is possible and wise in developing the               
              movement to complement multiple choice test items with other forms             
              of student assessment in the sciences.
