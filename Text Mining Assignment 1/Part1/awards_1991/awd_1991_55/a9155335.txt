Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              ACTION PHYSICS is intended to train 60 New York City middle                    
              school teachers (20 per year for three years) in New York City                 
              in basic physics concepts.  The training will involve teachers                 
              in the development and implementation of a series of                           
              activities which utilize the concepts of sports and dance and                  
              body movement as the experimental context for learning.  The                   
              project will strengthen teachers' abilities to use a variety                   
              of teaching strategies to present physics concepts in this                     
              motivating framework. The project is a cooperative effort of                   
              the Center for Advanced Study in Education (CUNY), Brooklyn                    
              College, CUNY Physics Department, The New York City Board of                   
              Education, the New York State Education and Research Network                   
              (NYSERnet), the American Physical Society, the New York                        
              Academy of Sciences, and The Institute for Schools of the                      
              Future.                                                                        
              Participants, who will receive graduate credit for some of the                 
              coursework taken, will have access to computers in the                         
              classrooms and will be eligible for a New York City program                    
              which loans computers to teachers for use in their homes.                      
              Access to the computers will enable the teachers to                            
              participate in electronic networking among themselves and with                 
              scientists associated with the project and with related groups                 
              and persons who use the NYSERnet and Internet.
