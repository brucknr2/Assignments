Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The University of Connecticut will initiate a six-week,                        
              residential, multidisciplinary Young Scholars project which will               
              offer science enrichment activities to 36 precollege students                  
              entering grades 11 and 12.                                                     
                                                                                             
              This summer program will emphasize highly interdisciplinary                    
              research participation in chemistry, physics, computer science,                
              engineering and the life sciences.  Projects will involve imaging              
              and computer-aided design, fabrication of microelectronic devices,             
              environmental problems, laser spectroscopy, and cellular and                   
              molecular mechanisms of neural circuits.  Research experience will             
              be gained through work in the laboratories of practicing                       
              researchers/mentors.
