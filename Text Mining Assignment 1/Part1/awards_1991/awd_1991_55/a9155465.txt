Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The project proposed by the Engineering Experiment Station of                  
              Texas A&M University has as its major goal development of a                    
              clear and supporting way for minorities, particularly minority                 
              women, in the San Antonio middle schools to enter the                          
              Highlands High School's Science and Engineering Core Program                   
              and thence into collegiate science and engineering programs.                   
              Students entering grades 7 through 12 will be involved in                      
              projects that infuse engineering design and problem solving                    
              into the curriculum.  To that end, teachers and parents will                   
              work with major Texas industry scientists and engineers to                     
              assist in curricular matters and also promote the long-term                    
              commitment to pursue advanced degrees in science and                           
              engineering.  The partnership will bear approximately 64% of                   
              the anticipated project costs.
