Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The North Carolina Museum of Life and Science requests support                 
              for a project in informal learning in the physical sciences in                 
              the Discovery Room at the North Carolina Museum of Life and                    
              Science which will be coordinated with the local middle                        
              school's 6th grade science program.  Among the anticipated                     
              activities are: (1) mentoring through pairing of the students                  
              with participating private sector scientists; (2) two 40-hour                  
              teacher in-service institutes on use of the resources in the                   
              Discovery Room; (3) replication of eight Discovery Room                        
              activities for classroom use throughout the Museum's greater                   
              region; and (4) development and dissemination of materials                     
              that will permit replication of Project Scientifica by other                   
              institutions.  The partnership will bear about 58% of the                      
              anticipated project costs.
