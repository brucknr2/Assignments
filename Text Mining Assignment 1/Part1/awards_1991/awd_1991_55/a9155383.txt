Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The "Escalante Math and Science Program" is an instructional                   
              program at East Los Angeles College that involves many                         
              elements that research has shown are characteristic of highly                  
              successful programs: a comprehensive well-developed plan,                      
              dedicated staff, parental involvement, community support,                      
              motivation strategies, agreed-upon objectives, coordinated                     
              support services, and a willingness to challenge institutional                 
              policies.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              This program will increase the number of students who are at                   
              and above grade level in mathematics and science and in                        
              addition will prepare inner-city , under-represented students                  
              for the Advanced Placement Test in calculus, computer science,                 
              chemistry, English, and physics.                                               
                                                                                             
              The program will develop a formal process to bring together                    
              teachers, counselors, and staff from junior high schools, high                 
              schools, community colleges, and four year colleges to improve                 
              course articulation and to better address the unique needs of                  
              the target population.                                                         
                                                                                             
              A leadership component assures that the project will be                        
              disseminated to other schools in the Los Angeles area.                         
              Substantial cost-sharing from the school district, industry,                   
              and East Los Angeles College indicates extensive support for                   
              this program.
