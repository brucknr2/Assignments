              This 30 month project, sponsored by the Institute for Chemical                 
              Education (ICE) at Madison, will carry out the following                       
              activities:                                                                    
              (1) Provide a two year intensive content and pedagogy summer                   
              workshop program for 50 high school chemistry teachers of                      
              minority students in the Los Angeles area.  Activities include                 
              a strong follow-up program during the academic year.  This                     
              program will be carried out on the campus of Mt. San Antonio                   
              College, Walnut, California.                                                   
              (2) Provide a two year intensive content and pedagogy summer                   
              workshop program for 40 middle school teachers selected from                   
              a national pool.  The program includes laboratory and                          
              laboratory safety techniques, work with computer applications,                 
              study of the connections chemistry makes with other fields and                 
              training in outreach activities.  Participants will have the                   
              opportunity to work with middle school students in the UW-                     
              Madison ChemCamp program.                                                      
              (3) Provide a two year intensive summer program for 25                         
              teachers each year to learn how to use chemistry                               
              instrumentation in the classroom.  This includes 15 master                     
              teachers, selected from the participants in the earlier                        
              instrumentation program, who will be given advanced training                   
              in the instrumentation and be prepared to give peer workshops                  
              in this subject.                                                               
              (4) Provide a one year program for 20 elementary school                        
              teachers to learn chemistry concepts and activities                            
              appropriate for the elementary school level.  Associated with                  
              this program is the training of college faculty called ICE                     
              affiliates who will learn, through attending those sessions,                   
              how to carry out their own inservice program.                                  
                                                                                             
              The matching funds, contributed from the University of                         
              Wisconsin-Madison, constitutes 13% of the NSF grant.
