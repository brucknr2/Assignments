Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              A Computer Environment to Encourage a Conceptual Approach to                   
              Problem Analysis                                                               
                                                                                             
              We are developing a computer-based environment called CONPSEP                  
              (Conceptual Problem Solving Environment in Physics) aimed at                   
              helping students integrate conceptual and quantitative                         
              knowledge within a problem solving setting.  CONPSEP constrains                
              students to perform a qualitative analysis of physics problems                 
              based on the principles, concepts and procedures that need to                  
              be applied to solve them.  The environment is intended to                      
              supplement traditional instruction (rather than supplant it) by                
              providing students with an opportunity to engage actively in                   
              conducting expert-like problem analyses of problems.  Thus,                    
              implementing CONPSEP within the traditional introductory                       
              physics curriculum does not require major modifications.                       
                                                                                             
              Formative evaluations are being carried out from the beginning                 
              of the project, and a summative evaluation will be conducted at                
              the end of the project.  Dissemination activities include                      
              publishing and marketing the software, as well as writing                      
              articles in educational journals and giving talks at                           
              professional organizations.***//
