Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This 18 month long project, sponsored by the Woodrow Wilson                    
              Fellowship Foundation, will provide a summer program in the                    
              History of Chemistry for 50 outstanding high school teachers                   
              selected from a national pool.  The summer activities will                     
              include lectures on the ancient arts of chemistry and the                      
              evolution of the field up through the development of modern                    
              chemistry.  The laboratory and demonstration portion of the                    
              project will include the classic experiments of chemistry.                     
              The best of the materials developed by the teachers in the                     
              summer will be edited and published for use in the follow-up                   
              and outreach activities the teachers will conduct during the                   
              next academic year.  These outreach activities are supported                   
              by the resources provided by the Woodrow Wilson Fellowship                     
              Foundation.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              The matching funds for the summer portion of the project                       
              amount to about 6% of the NSF grant.  The matching funds for                   
              the outreach portion of the project exceeds 300% of the NSF                    
              grant.
