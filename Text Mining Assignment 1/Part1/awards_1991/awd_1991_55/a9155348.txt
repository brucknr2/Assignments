Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The grant would substantially fund a 3 year project which                      
              would provide 2-week summer inservice training for teachers                    
              and teacher leaders in physical science. Grades K-12 would be                  
              included with most of the focus on pre-high school.                            
                                                                                             
              The summer workshops would both train a cadre of                               
              teacher/leaders in conducting workshops (20 per summer) and                    
              offer direct and indirect training in physical sciences to                     
              teachers. Local teachers would be the recipients of the                        
              practice and demonstration workshops in the summer.                            
              Additionally, trained leaders would be expected to run                         
              workshops in their own communities and return the following                    
              summer to share with the new group of leader trainers. The                     
              total impact would be on 60 trained trainers and 1200 other                    
              recipients of the training.                                                    
                                                                                             
              An additional feature of the project is the ongoing support                    
              and sharing among those involved. Through academic year                        
              Saturday meetings, newsletters, a source book, and return                      
              meetings with new leaders, a substantial communication                         
              mechanism is established.
