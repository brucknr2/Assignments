Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              In the mid-1980's, Denver Audubon Society developed a model                    
              Urban Education Project.  The Project engages thousands of                     
              8-12 year olds and trained volunteers in hands-on                              
              investigations of neighborhood plants, animals, and                            
              ecological relationships each year.  With NSF support, we                      
              have helped seven other cities establish similar projects                      
              and have proven that the project model is highly successful                    
              and adaptable.                                                                 
                                                                                             
              This proposal requests funds to develop a kit of strategies                    
              and materials that will enable us to further disseminate the                   
              model in a time-and cost-efficient manner.  The                                
              dissemination kit will be tested as experienced project                        
              leaders from established projects help eight new cities                        
              start local projects.  Their feedback will direct us in                        
              revising the kits.                                                             
                                                                                             
              By 1993, the completed dissemination kits will give                            
              experienced project leaders the tools necessary to help                        
              parents, informal education institutions, and concerned                        
              citizens across the country establish similar ecology                          
              education projects in their communities.
