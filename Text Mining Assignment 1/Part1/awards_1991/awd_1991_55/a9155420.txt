Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This 2 1/2 year project, sponsored by the Social Sciences                      
              Education Consortium Inc. (SSEC), will implement a curriculum,                 
              based upon the history and nature of science  and technology                   
              (HNST), in selected school districts throughout the nation.                    
              The project is organized in three stages.  The first stage                     
              consists of the development of a teacher education resource                    
              book based upon the HNST curriculum.  the second stage                         
              consists of an intensive summer program for 40 teachers                        
              consisting of teams of teachers from the selected school                       
              districts.  The summer programs will include content and                       
              pedagogy enhancement as well as preparation for the                            
              implementation of the curriculum.  The third stage of the                      
              project consists of follow-up activities in the districts,                     
              development of inservice plans and implementation of the new                   
              curriculum in each district with the help of the resources of                  
              SSEC and the Biological Sciences Curriculum Study (BSCS).                      
              The NSF grant is being matched by SSEC and the school                          
              districts by funds equivalent to 46% of the NSF award.
