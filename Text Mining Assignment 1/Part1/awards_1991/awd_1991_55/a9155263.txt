Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              The Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation will                         
              conduct a two-and-one-half-year project to expand the                          
              existing Woodrow Wilson Fellowship Program for middle and                      
              high school mathematics teachers to include two new strands:                   
              Quantity (for middle school teachers in 1992) and Change                       
              (for high school teachers in 1993).  Each strand would                         
              consist of a four-week summer institute for 50 expert,                         
              experienced mathematics teachers (held on the Princeton                        
              University campus), outreach projects initiated by teachers                    
              from the institutes, and one-week regional summer institutes                   
              each led by a team of four teachers from the four-week                         
              institutes.  Participants from the four-week institutes will                   
              adapt materials, resources and technology presented at the                     
              institutes into units for classroom use which will be field-                   
              tested, edited, and disseminated through the one-week                          
              institutes.                                                                    
                                                                                             
              The goal of the Quantity institute is to help teachers                         
              develop solid, informal understanding of statistics from                       
              experiences involving the collection, organization,                            
              representation and interpretation of data, and to develop                      
              concepts and methods for investigating situations involving                    
              change, to make predictions when uncertainty exists, and to                    
              make sense out of statistical claims.  The goal of the                         
              Change institute is to help teachers become sensitive to the                   
              patterns of change and to learn to use the tools that will                     
              be necessary to study these patterns.                                          
                                                                                             
              Second-wave participants of the outreach programs and one-                     
              week institutes should number approximately 3000, bringing                     
              the total number of teachers enhanced to approximately 3100.                   
                                                                                             
              The Woodrow Wilson Program has a distinguished history of                      
              high quality institutes with participants exerting a long                      
              term influence on their peers through continuing teacher                       
              enhancement efforts financed by the private sector.  The Pew                   
              Charitable Trusts' cost-sharing on this project accounts for                   
              60% of the NSF budget.
