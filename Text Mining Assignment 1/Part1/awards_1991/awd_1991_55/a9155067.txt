Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Central Connecticut State University will initiate a three-                
              week, residential, multidisciplinary Young Scholars project which              
              will provide science enrichment activities for 50 students entering            
              grades 9 and 10.                                                               
                                                                                             
              This summer program will emphasize research participation in                   
              biology, chemistry, the earth sciences and physics.  The program               
              includes students from groups "at risk" of underrepresentation in              
              the sciences and uses a combination of laboratory and field                    
              experiences and experiments, a research project, demonstrations,               
              lectures and discussions to encourage participants to pursue                   
              science and engineering education vocations.  It provides intensive            
              interdisciplinary exposure to science concepts and methods as                  
              students design and conduct their own experiments.
