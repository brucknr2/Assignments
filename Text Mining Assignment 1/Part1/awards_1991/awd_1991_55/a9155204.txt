Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Georgetown University seeks funding for a two year leadership                  
              program in dynamical modeling for 15 District of Columbia area high            
              school teachers.  The participants, four three-member teams from               
              each of four area school districts and one three-member team from              
              the private schools, will be selected from teachers who have                   
              participated in an existing program in dynamical modeling at                   
              Georgetown University.  The participants will meet several times               
              during the first school year further develop, implement and monitor            
              progress of results from the dynamical modeling project.  They will            
              then attend a two-week summer leadership training workshop to                  
              develop an in-depth inservice course to be team-taught to other                
              teachers in their school system in the succeeding two years.                   
              During the intervening summer, participants and PI's will attend a             
              one-week evaluation seminar.  Four follow-up seminars will be held             
              during each of the two academic years to monitor progress of the               
              inservice courses.                                                             
                                                                                             
              Cost sharing by the university and the schools constitutes 27% of              
              the award.
