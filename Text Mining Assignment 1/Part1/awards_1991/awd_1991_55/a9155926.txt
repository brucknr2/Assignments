Abstract    :
                   A pilot project has been designed to develop a component                  
              of student participation in research for an introductory                       
              physics curriculum.  The initial test of this project will                     
              involve a partnership program between a university physics                     
              department and a local community college.  A summer session                    
              introductory course will consist of morning introductory                       
              sessions and afternoon time in various research laboratories.                  
              Graduate student mentors will assist students in their choice                  
              of research area ans provide individual tutorials.
