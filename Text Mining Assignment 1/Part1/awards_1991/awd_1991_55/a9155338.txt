Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Community School District 6 in New York has a total                            
              enrollment of 23,000 students in grades kindergarten through                   
              8th grade.  This district extends across Manhattan from                        
              135th St. to 220th St., and has an 85% Hispanic student                        
              population, of which 40% have limited English abilities.                       
              Almost 95% of the students qualify for the free lunch                          
              program.  Mr. Robert Werner, Science Coordinator of the                        
              district, has proposed a comprehensive five-year plan for                      
              training the district's teachers in a recently adopted hands                   
              on inquiry-based science curriculum for the elementary                         
              grades.  One lead teacher per grade per school has already                     
              received some training by district science coordinators.                       
              This project would greatly accelerate and expand the                           
              training effort, and would establish a leadership team in                      
              each school composed of three lead teachers, the Principal,                    
              and the Science Assistant Principal.  The Workshop Center of                   
              CCNY and EDC would provide training for the lead teachers,                     
              principals, and assistant principals.  The lead teachers                       
              would be released from their classrooms for three periods                      
              per week, in order to provide training to the other teachers                   
              in their school.                                                               
                                                                                             
              The proposed teacher enhancement project will have                             
              significant impact on a school district with enormous need.                    
              A total of 180 teachers will receive training directly in                      
              workshop settings, and the remaining 600 will have frequent                    
              in-class coaching and mentoring by their lead teacher                          
              colleagues.  The plan to provide training to school                            
              administrators will assure a long-term change in the                           
              attitudes of school officials toward science instruction.                      
              The school district has demonstrated its commitment to                         
              exemplary science education in the past, and has made firm                     
              commitments for future contributions.                                          
                                                                                             
              Cost sharing by the school district represents 124% of the                     
              NSF contribution.
