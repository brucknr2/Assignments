Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Clark County School District(CCSD) will provide staff                          
              development for elementary teachers (72 in mathematics, 72 in                  
              science) and administrators to become leaders and agents of                    
              change. By means of this systematic plan to empower educators                  
              an opportunity will be created for every K-6 grade student to                  
              become an active learner and scientifically and mathematically                 
              literate.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              The participants are well prepared teachers who are                            
              knowledgeable about content and conversant with current                        
              instructional strategies on how children learn mathematics and                 
              science.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              The staff for the project include nationally recognized                        
              experts from the Lawrence Hall of Science(U.C Berkeley),The                    
              Math Learning Center(Portland State University), The Center                    
              for Excellence in Mathematics Education(Western Washington                     
              University) and TERC. The materials to be adopted stress the                   
              use of manipulatives and hands on learning and include Math                    
              and the Mind's Eye, FOSS and SAVI/SELPH.                                       
                                                                                             
              The leadership component will be patterned on the California                   
              Mathematics Leadership Program(CMLP) an NSF funded project                     
              under the leadership of Ruth Parker who will serve as a                        
              consultant on this project. In the third and fourth years of                   
              the program the participants will assume their                                 
              responsibilities for leadership by teaching in Staff                           
              Development centers throughout the school district and working                 
              with peer teachers in schools.                                                 
                                                                                             
              A history of the project will be maintained by the co-                         
              directors.  This will serve to document the process of change                  
              and the consequences for teachers, administrators and students                 
              in a large and diverse school district which includes rural,                   
              suburban and inner city schools. This will serve as a model                    
              for other districts planning similar in depth staff                            
              development to empower teachers as agents of change.  Cost                     
              sharing is equal to 94% of NSF funding requested.//
