Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The University of Missouri @ St. Louis will initiate a six-week,               
              commuter, multidisciplinary Young Scholars project offering science            
              enrichment activities for 24 precollege students entering grade 12.            
                                                                                             
              The Engelmann Student Research Program provides high-ability high              
              school students with the opportunity to conduct research projects              
              in mathematics and science under the supervision of a faculty                  
              mentor.  Participants apply various problem-solving strategies to              
              their independent projects, write technical reports and present the            
              results in oral presentations.  They are provided with formal                  
              instruction on technical communication skills.  Career confabs and             
              industrial field trips expose them to a wide variety of job                    
              possibilities.  Eight follow-up meetings are held during the                   
              academic year to increase student career awareness and to help                 
              participants carry on independent research projects in their high              
              school setting.
