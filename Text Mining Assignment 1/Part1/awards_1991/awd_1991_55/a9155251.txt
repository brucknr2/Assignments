Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Four campuses of the University of Massachusetts system                        
              (Amherst, Dartmouth, Lowell, and Boston) have designed a                       
              regional network to support the high school physics teachers                   
              in the area.  Each campus will offer a three-week commuter                     
              workshop, at which 24 teachers will learn about contemporary                   
              research topics in physics and strategies for incorporating                    
              this new content knowledge into their classroom instruction.                   
              The most experienced teachers at these workshops will be                       
              invited to attend a week-long residential institute devoted                    
              to developing new classroom activities based on the research                   
              topics presented.  These activities will be disseminated to                    
              all school districts in the region, and through the                            
              Massachusetts Statewide Systemic Initiative, Project PALMS.                    
              Each campus will also establish a permanent teachers                           
              resource center within its physics department.  The centers                    
              will offer teachers the loan of equipment for classroom use,                   
              and will provide ongoing help in the form of workshops,                        
              network meetings, newsletters, and interactions with members                   
              of the research faculty.                                                       
                                                                                             
              Partnerships such as this between research universities and                    
              secondary schools have significant potential for long-term                     
              improvement of science education.  The regional scale of                       
              this partnership is exceptional and increases further the                      
              opportunity for widespread permanent improvement.                              
                                                                                             
              Cost sharing on this project represents 22% of the NSF                         
              contribution.
