Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              SPICA II is a continuation of Project SPICA (Support Program for               
              Instructional Competency in Astronomy), a program that promotes the            
              use of hands-on, activity-based science learning at all grade                  
              levels.  The program, which is designed to increase the amount and             
              quality of physical science being taught, relies on the                        
              attractiveness of astronomy to provide the vehicle for achieving               
              its goals.  Each summer for three years thirty different teachers              
              will participate in three week institutes where they will become               
              familiar with and use hands-on educational materials and learn                 
              related teaching methods.  These teachers then become SPICA                    
              'agents', delivering workshops which emphasize hands-on activities             
              to other teachers in their home regions, districts, and states.                
              Some of the teachers teach at the college-level and will develop               
              and deliver in-service courses through university continuing                   
              education programs.  In addition, a teacher's handbook of                      
              activities will be produced and made commercially available.  Funds            
              from sales of the handbook will be used to help finance the ongoing            
              SPICA network.
