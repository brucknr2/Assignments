Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Interface Institute has proposed the expansion and development                 
              of a project, begun with the support of the Edna McConnell                     
              Clark Foundation, which targets Black and Hispanic middle                      
              school/junior high school teachers and youth in the Elmhurst                   
              District of East Oakland, California.  Activities to occur                     
              with National Science Foundation support include: (1)                          
              expansion of the network of scientists and corporate                           
              representatives working directly with teachers and students                    
              through classroom visits, field trips, job shadowing and                       
              mentoring; (2) design and distribution of "hands-on"                           
              materials, activities, and demonstrations to enhance the                       
              California State Science Framework (CSSF) curriculum; (3)                      
              involvement of increasing numbers of students in after-school                  
              programs at the Interface Institute which support classroom                    
              worked based on the CSSF.
