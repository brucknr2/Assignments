Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This three year project, sponsored by the Joint Council on                     
              Economic Education, will support a nationwide teacher                          
              enhancement program whose objective is to prepare teachers                     
              to teach advanced placement economics in the high schools.                     
              The program will take place at four sites (University of                       
              California, Los Angeles; University of Minnesota; Purdue                       
              University; Clemson University) and 25 well prepared teach-                    
              ers will be selected from each region to attend a 2 1/2 day                    
              orientation session and a three week summer session.  The                      
              teachers will learn both content and instructional tech-                       
              niques and will also be prepared to be teacher trainers so                     
              that the regional workshops can be replicated at local                         
              sites.  In the second year of the project staff will devel-                    
              op a teacher training manual which can be used in the                          
              inservice activities.  In the third year the resources of                      
              the Joint Council will be used to help the teacher trainers                    
              carry out in-service programs to disseminate the curriculum                    
              locally.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              The matching funds provided by the Joint Council on Econom-                    
              ic Education constitute more than 122% of the NSF grant.
