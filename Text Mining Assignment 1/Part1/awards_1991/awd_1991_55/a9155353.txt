Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project is a three year program that will provide                         
              teacher enhancement to 150 elementary and secondary school                     
              teachers from Long Island, New York.  The project which will                   
              have a strong minority focus, consists of five components:                     
              three week summer institutes for elementary teachers and                       
              secondary biology teachers; research experiences in                            
              biological sciences for secondary teachers; videotaped                         
              exchange sessions between master teachers and less                             
              experienced teachers (both elementary and secondary);                          
              seminars and workshops during the school year on issues in                     
              science and science teaching for secondary teachers; and a                     
              teachers network for science teachers in high minority                         
              school districts.                                                              
                                                                                             
              The summer institutes will be held at SUNY - Old Westbury.                     
              The first year institute, for secondary teachers, will                         
              address conceptual and pedagological issues in Neurobiology.                   
              The second year institute, also for secondary teachers, will                   
              focus on local ecology and related environmental issues.                       
              The third institute, for elementary teachers will provide                      
              basic knowledge in the natural sciences and introduce the                      
              method of conceptual change as a means of introducing                          
              scientific concepts into the elementary classroom.                             
                                                                                             
              Cost sharing equals 6.7% of the NSF award.
