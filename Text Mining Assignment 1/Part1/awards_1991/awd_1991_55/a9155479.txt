Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project will enable 30 secondary teachers, 15 graduate                    
              students and 15 faculty from primarily undergraduate                           
              institutions to participate in the 27th International                          
              Geographical Congress.  The main Congress will be held in                      
              Washington, D.C., August 9-14, 1992.  Participant support                      
              will enable teachers to attend the main Congress plus                          
              participate in scientific field seminars around the United                     
              States immediately before or immediately after the main                        
              Congress.  The Congress will have a special session on U.S.                    
              Geographical Education.                                                        
                                                                                             
              A 14-volume set of guidebooks will be produced.  These will                    
              be useful to participants in the field seminars and as                         
              instructional materials to enhance the teaching of                             
              geography.  Following the Congress, participants will become                   
              members of an IGU Commission, form a network to share                          
              resources and teaching ideas, lead peer workshops and                          
              prepare a report in 1993 for submission to the USNC/IGU.                       
                                                                                             
              The PI for this project is Dr. Anthony de Souza.  Cost                         
              sharing will exceed 20% of the NSF award.
