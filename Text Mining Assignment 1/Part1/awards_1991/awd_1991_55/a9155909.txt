Abstract    :
              This project will illustrate fundamental concepts in                           
              introductory chemistry through innovative lecture                              
              demonstrations that involve the use of low-cost and readily                    
              accessible laser light sources.  Incorporation of these                        
              innovations in the General Chemistry course will enhance                       
              students' awareness of the creative contemporary approaches                    
              available to pursue classical questions in chemistry.  The                     
              lecture demonstrations will augment teaching of such topics as                 
              thermodynamics, kinetics, acid-base equilibria, chemical                       
              bonding, and atomic spectroscopy.  These laser-based activities                
              are designed to enrich the students' understanding of the                      
              course material and stimulate their interest in chemistry.                     
              Students will gain a more accurate reflection of the dynamic                   
              nature of chemistry and the responsiveness of the field to                     
              advances in technology as well as an illustration of the way in                
              which chemistry is currently practiced.  Curricular materials                  
              developed from this project will be made available to the                      
              undergraduate community from other institutions and will be                    
              presented at national and local conferences in chemistry and                   
              education.
