Abstract    :
              Case Studies of exemplary collegiate mathematics programs are                  
              being developed. These projects will be highlighted in a volume                
              describing model programs that illustrate different aspects of                 
              the many recommendations calling for change and revitalization                 
              of undergraduate mathematics programs. The MAA's Committee on                  
              Undergraduate Programs in Mathematics is serving as an advisory                
              committee for the project.
