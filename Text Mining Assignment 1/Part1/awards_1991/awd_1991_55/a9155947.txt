Abstract    :
              The calculus-based introductory physics course, with an annual                 
              enrollment of roughly 150,000 students, is the educational                     
              cornerstone for all physical science and engineering majors as                 
              well as the primary influence on general physics courses at                    
              lower levels. This project draws upon: 1) physics education                    
              research, 2) computer technology and software development for                  
              physics, and 3) guidelines developed by the Introductory                       
              University Physics Project in order to develop a unified new                   
              curriculum for the course. Emphasis is placed on incorporating                 
              effective pedagogy into the course, on the use of a "story                     
              line" and improved course structure, and on bringing a                         
              significant component of 20th century physics into the course.                 
              The aspect of this course that sets it apart from curriculum                   
              development efforts elsewhere is that it is aimed primarily at                 
              universities that teach large numbers of students. This is the                 
              target audience that must be reached if new developments in                    
              science education are to succeed. Specific attention will be                   
              given to the many constraints that a large university setting                  
              places on the course.
