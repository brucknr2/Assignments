Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Canyon Ferry Limnological Institute, Montana Office of                     
              Public Instruction, and Montana State University will offer                    
              a four week summer training workshop in aquatic ecology for                    
              teachers that reside along the Missouri River.  This project                   
              will introduce teachers to the process of scientific                           
              investigation through a multi-year limnological study of the                   
              Missouri River.  A network of over 100 teachers along the                      
              Missouri River from Montana to St. Louis will be developed                     
              and will involve their approximately 10,000 students per                       
              year in simultaneous sampling and assessment of the Missouri                   
              River's water quality.  Over the three year funding, July 1,                   
              1992 - June 30, 1995, approximately 150 teachers and 50,000                    
              students will participate in the project.  There will be an                    
              approximate cost-share of 32%.
