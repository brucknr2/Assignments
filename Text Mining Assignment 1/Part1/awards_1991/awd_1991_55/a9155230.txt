Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This purpose of this project is to produce a cadre of 96                       
              exemplary high school biology teachers for a cluster of                        
              urban, minority school districts.  Through a four week                         
              summer workshop,  six Saturday sessions and two classroom                      
              visits by university personnel, these teachers will acquire                    
              1) a strong knowledge and laboratory skills base in cell and                   
              molecular biology and in industrial and environmental                          
              microbiology; 2) an understanding of science process; 3)                       
              training in innovative instructional methods and curriculum                    
              design for teaching biology; and 4) a greater understanding                    
              of the barriers to achievement in biology faced by urban,                      
              minority students.                                                             
                                                                                             
              It is proposed that the teachers engage in a guided research                   
              experience during the summer workshop and in their                             
              classrooms.  It is also proposed that the teachers will                        
              develop and use new curricular materials that will foster                      
              student interest in biological sciences careers and prepare                    
              students to pursue a college major leading toward such a                       
              career.  The curricular materials will also be made                            
              available for replication in other districts.                                  
                                                                                             
              Cost sharing equals 11.2 % of the NSF award.
