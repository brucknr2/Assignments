Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Boston Partners in Education, Inc., a not-for-profit                       
              organization whose purpose is mounting partnerships to improve                 
              elementary and secondary education in Boston, in consort with                  
              the Executive Service Corps of New England, Cabot Corporation,                 
              and the New England Aquarium, seek support for a 4-year                        
              project to develop instructional materials for grades 2 - 5                    
              around a theme of "water," design and implement teacher                        
              training programs for the use of these materials, and develop                  
              at-home activities, guest speakers, field trips, and career                    
              exposure.  Included are a well developed evaluation and                        
              dissemination components.  The partnership is contributing                     
              approximately 63% of the anticipated costs in this $1M                         
              project.
