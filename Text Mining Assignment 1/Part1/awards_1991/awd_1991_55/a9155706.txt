Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This conference, sponsored by ORAU and the Department of                       
              Energy, is being held to inform participants how to create                     
              college and school partnerships, which are defined as                          
              including college science faculty, college education faculty                   
              and K-12 teachers.  Between 200 and 250 persons will attend                    
              the conference. The conference will present ideas, techniques                  
              and strategies for the development of these partnerships.  In                  
              addition possible models for partnerships as well as actual                    
              existing partnerships will be described.  The outcomes of the                  
              conference will be the proceedings, the actual development of                  
              partnerships and the development of a network of support using                 
              the resources of ORAU and the Department of Energy.                            
                                                                                             
              Matching funds from ORAU, the Department of Energy and other                   
              sources amount to 225% of the NSF grant.
