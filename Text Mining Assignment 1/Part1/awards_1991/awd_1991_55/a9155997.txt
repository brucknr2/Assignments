Abstract    :
              The objective of this project  is to  develop a method of                      
              teaching that will attract more women to science courses. The                  
              project develops innovative complementary courses in                           
              introductory biology and chemistry with a new atmosphere in the                
              expository portion and with a laboratory component designed to                 
              promote the investigative nature of science. The introductory                  
              course changes include: (1) The establishment of a mode of                     
              education common to both biology and chemistry, allowing                       
              considerable cross-referencing between the courses. (2) The                    
              development of open-ended laboratory experiences which will                    
              encourage small groups of students to determine the parameters                 
              of selected questions and, with minimal faculty direction, to                  
              design and run significant experiments themselves. (3) The                     
              development of computer simulations that complement the wet                    
              laboratory exercises which will allow greater freedom of                       
              preliminary exploration by students in a non-threatening and                   
              less time-consuming way.
