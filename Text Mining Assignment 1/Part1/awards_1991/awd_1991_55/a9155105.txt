Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Villanova University will initiate a six-week summer, residential              
              Young Scholars project in Mathematics and Biology for 36 students              
              entering grades 11 and 12.                                                     
                                                                                             
              The project combines coursework with extensive laboratory and                  
              research experience.  The subject matter in the two disciplines is             
              presented in an innovative, unified manner that emphasizes                     
              interdisciplinary connections, underlying principles of scientific             
              inference, quantitative thinking and techniques of visualization.              
              Participants will use two new NSF-funded laboratories for                      
              experiments in physiology and for simulation and visualization of              
              biological systems.  Field trips and on-campus activities will                 
              increase students' awareness of the broad horizon of research                  
              career opportunities in the sciences and mathematics.  Participants            
              will explore important course-related issues of scientific ethics              
              in open discussions with project staff and visiting scientists.                
              Academic year follow-up activities will include the implementation             
              of individual research projects designed by the students during the            
              summer component of the project.  Participants will use electronic             
              mail for exchange of ideas and experimental results during this                
              phase of the project.
