Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project is a one year program that will team 48                           
              secondary teachers (grades 7-12), from four Massachusetts                      
              communities, with biotechnology scientists through the                         
              auspices of the Massachusetts Biotechnology Council and the                    
              Massachusetts Biotechnology Research Park.  During a two                       
              week summer institute, 24 participants will be introduced to                   
              content area in biotechnology and related basic biology.                       
              During a second one week summer institute for 24                               
              participants, many who have attended a previous                                
              biotechnology institute, will be introduced to some advanced                   
              principles of cell and molecular biology including Alzheimer                   
              Disease and AIDS.  Hands-on laboratories and interactive                       
              teaching tools will be presented by scientists at their                        
              industrial sites.  Potential classroom activities will be                      
              presented by educators from the New England Science Center.                    
              Science pedagogy specialists will discuss ideas for                            
              classroom activities and curriculum with the participants.                     
                                                                                             
              Monthly meetings between the scientists and participants                       
              during the academic year will focus on curriculum concepts                     
              and skill building.  Each scientist-teacher team will                          
              develop an additional activity for classroom use.  Each                        
              activity, along with a brief outline of concepts and skills                    
              involved and a list of industry resources used in                              
              development, will be included in a source book to be shared                    
              by participants.                                                               
                                                                                             
              Cost sharing equals 120.4% of the NSF award.
