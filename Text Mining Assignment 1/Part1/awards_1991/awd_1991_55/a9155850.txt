Abstract    :
              A one semester hour lab course to be taken with or after the                   
              completion of the traditional freshman-sophomore level                         
              elementary statistics course is being developed. The lab guides                
              the student through simple, but meaningful, experiments which                  
              illustrate important points of applied statistics. In each                     
              session the students  discuss and perform an experiment,                       
              collect and analyze data, and write a report. The lab differs                  
              from traditional science labs in that the emphasis will be on                  
              statistical concepts. Students in the lab are being compared                   
              with a control group with regard to performance in elementary                  
              statistics and propensity to enroll in additional statistics                   
              courses. Student and teacher's manuals are being  prepared; the                
              materials will be pilot tested at another institution; and a                   
              national advisory committee is in place.
