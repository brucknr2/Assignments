Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Dr. Vera Zdravkovich is a professor of chemistry at Prince                     
              George's Community College in Largo, Maryland.  She has                        
              spearheaded summer institutes for elementary teachers in the                   
              past, and she now proposes to expand these efforts                             
              significantly.  Dr. Zdravkovich has initiated collaborations                   
              among four of Maryland's community colleges, with the                          
              purpose of forming a network of science faculty members                        
              interested in improving pre-college science education.                         
              Eleven faculty members from Cecil Community College, Anne                      
              Arundel Community College, and Hagerstown Junior College                       
              will attend workshops together to become familiar with                         
              exemplary instructional materials and approaches to                            
              elementary science education.  These science faculty members                   
              will serve an internship at the 1992 summer teachers                           
              institute at Prince George's Community College.  Additional                    
              workshops held during the 1992-93 academic year will add 28                    
              science faculty members to the cadre of trained scientists,                    
              who will then plan and implement teacher enhancement                           
              institutes at their host institutions.                                         
                                                                                             
              Community colleges are strategically positioned for                            
              significant impact on pre-college science education.                           
              Interactions among their education and science faculties can                   
              catalyze important opportunities that have not emerged from                    
              research universities.  The proposed collaborations among                      
              Maryland's community colleges has the potential for                            
              substantial impact, and can serve as a model for other                         
              states.                                                                        
                                                                                             
              Cost sharing on this project amounts to 132% of the NSF                        
              contribution.
