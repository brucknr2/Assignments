Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Long Beach Unified School District seeks National Science                      
              Foundation support for a project that will augment existing                    
              curriculum in a 4-year high school which focuses on the study                  
              of science, mathematics, and technology.  The overall thrust                   
              of the project is providing the students with workplace                        
              experiences that are connected to principles they learn in the                 
              classroom.  Among the major activities for which support is                    
              sought are: (1) development of a "pre-professional" curriculum                 
              to integrate study of workplace applications into regular 9th                  
              grade classroom instruction; (2) mentor program for 9th and                    
              10th grade students; and (3) internships and work experiences                  
              for 11th and 12th grade students.  The partnership will bear                   
              79% of the anticipated project costs.
