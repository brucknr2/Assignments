Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              To provide the general public with an understanding of the                     
              basic principles that underlie the transmission, storage, and                  
              retrieval of information, the Fleet Center proposes to build                   
              SIGNALS, a 4,500 square foot exhibition.  SIGNALS will be                      
              divided into three sections, of approximately 15 interactive                   
              exhibits each, which explore the physical principles of wave                   
              motion, the properties of electromagnetic pulses useful for                    
              communications, and the signal processing that enables us to                   
              handle information.                                                            
                                                                                             
              An Advisory Committee comprised of highly qualified                            
              individuals at the leading edge of their fields will support                   
              development of SIGNALS; a very experienced team of exhibit                     
              developers will fabricate the exhibition.  SIGNALS will become                 
              a permanent exhibition in an expanded Fleet Center, where it                   
              is expected to attract 1 million visitors a year, including at                 
              least 100,000 K-12 students.                                                   
                                                                                             
              Since the lack of technological understanding is a national                    
              problem, we propose to build a 3,000 square foot traveling                     
              version of SIGNALS, contingent upon an NSF review of the                       
              completed permanent exhibition.  The total cost for both                       
              exhibitions is $1,983,480.  We are requesting $985,900 from                    
              NSF:  $692,800 for the permanent exhibition and $293,100 for                   
              the traveling exhibition.  The project will begin in June,                     
              1992, and be completed by June, 1996.
