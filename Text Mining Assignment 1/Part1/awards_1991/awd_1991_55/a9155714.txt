Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project is to lay the groundwork for a practical                          
              implementation of the knowledge assessment techniques,                         
              developed by the PI and his collaborators, in some selected                    
              schools in Orange County California.  This involves gathering                  
              a team of collaborators, including teachers, securing the                      
              appropriate physical conditions, and beginning the                             
              construction of the pedagogical materials.  The proposed work                  
              is broken down into five phases:                                               
                                                                                             
                   1.  contact with local elementary, junior, and senior                     
              high schools;                                                                  
                                                                                             
                   2.  assemble the team of researchers, including the PI's                  
              and 4 expert teachers;                                                         
                                                                                             
                   3.  selection of a large collection of items to form the                  
              domain of the knowledge structures, and covering                               
              grades 1-12;                                                                   
                                                                                             
                   4.  analyze the selected items for conceptual content and                 
              skills for mastery;                                                            
                                                                                             
                   5.  use the QUERY routine to make a first pass at                         
              building the knowledge structures, using the teachers                          
              as subjects;
