Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Founded in 1979, the Science Skills Center (SSC) is a non-profit               
              community based program which encourages young minority and                    
              female students to pursue careers in science, mathematics, and                 
              technology.  At its current two sites, located in Brooklyn, New                
              York, approximately 400 students, ages six to eighteen, are                    
              enrolled in programs where they take accelerated courses in                    
              biology, chemistry, physical science, rocketry, oceanography,                  
              botany, and advanced mathematics.  Classes, which are presented                
              within the cultural and linguistic understanding of minority                   
              children, provide students with an opportunity to recognize the                
              relationship of science, mathematics, and technology to their                  
              everyday lives.  The SSC proposes to replicate its present                     
              programs, establishing three additional sites in the New York                  
              City area in three years.  The SSC also proposes to establish a                
              systematic replication program which would assist other                        
              communities, both regional and national, to establish their own                
              SSCs.  This project would require a resource person to guide                   
              communities in all aspects of program development.  To assist in               
              that effort, SSC proposes development of comprehensive                         
              educational and administrative manuals as well as the                          
              preparation of accompanying training and profile videos.                       
              Finally, the SSC proposes to develop a research module in                      
              software and manual form which would assess and track student                  
              learning, school performance, performance on standardized exams,               
              career aspiration and selection, and student attitudes in a                    
              community based science program targeting minority students.
