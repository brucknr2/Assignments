Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal calls for development, over five years, of a                     
              national, interactive, telecommunications-supported Network of                 
              85 or more affiliated neighborhood technology learning centers                 
              in inner cities and other impoverished areas, for the purpose of               
              attracting, and then nurturing underserved peoples' active                     
              involvement with math, science, and technology.                                
                                                                                             
              Network affiliates will provide informal opportunities for                     
              disadvantaged minority young people and their families and                     
              friends to get access to, and learn to use, the most powerful                  
              tool for personal empowerment yet known, to engage in                          
              explorations designed to increase awareness of their ability to                
              do math and science and of the potential for careers in these                  
              areas, and, through telecommunications, to involve themselves                  
              with distant peer groups in collaborative investigations.  Such                
              opportunities present attractive and cost-effective alternatives               
              to the dead ends that street life, drugs, incarceration, and/or                
              welfare offer.                                                                 
                                                                                             
              Success in achieving these goals depends, however, on the                      
              availability of continuing programmatic and staff development                  
              assistance, and on the ability of Network members to engage, not               
              as disparate entities, but as a mutually supportive community,                 
              in this momentous task.  Proposed Network services include (in                 
              addition to telecommunications linkages) the identification,                   
              development, and dissemination of technology-mediated math and                 
              science activities appropriate to community education,                         
              consultative planning and technical assistance, staff                          
              development workshops, the development of a resource database,                 
              and an annual all-affiliates meeting -- all these to be                        
              accompanied by systematized self-assessment procedures.  Also                  
              included is the development of a Network infrastructure to                     
              support continued existence of the Network beyond the grant                    
              period.//
