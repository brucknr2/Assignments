Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              This three year program will train 60 high school biology                      
              teachers (3 groups of 20/year) in Molecular Biology, Gene                      
              Cloning, and Recombinant DNA Technology. This will be                          
              accomplished by two week summer institutes, held at Miami                      
              University, Oxford Campus, that include both content and                       
              pedagogy, with emphasis on a hands-on approach. A curriculum                   
              consultant and a previous pilot program participant will                       
              work with the participants to facilitate appropriate                           
              implementation of content and laboratory procedures in the                     
              participant's classrooms. The P.I. will also facilitate the                    
              implementation of experiments into the participants'                           
              classrooms via academic year support services and by                           
              establishing contacts for participants with other nearby                       
              Ohio universities and biotechnology industries.                                
                                                                                             
              Cost sharing equals 78.5 % of the NSF award.
