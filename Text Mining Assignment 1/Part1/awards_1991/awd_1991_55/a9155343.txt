Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This three year model program will assist a significant                        
              portion of the estimated 2,000 high school biology teachers                    
              in the Texas Gulf Coast Region, to implement biotechnology                     
              concepts in their Introductory Biology classrooms.  The                        
              model to be employed, the Texas Biotechnology Teacher                          
              Enhancement Program (BTEP) model, consists of extensive                        
              training of previous four day workshop participants in                         
              three-week summer institutes; coupled with a collaborative                     
              network of scientists from the private sector, Texas A&M                       
              Research and Extension Centers and cooperating institutions:                   
              a broad based Advisory Board; and a highly skilled staff                       
              which will carry out a carefully designed implementation                       
              support process and project data collection.                                   
                                                                                             
              Upon successful implementation in their classrooms, selected                   
              institute participants will lead awareness and four day                        
              workshop activities in their local areas, with support from                    
              local Research and Extension Centers and cooperating                           
              institutions.  Specifically, 1,200 Biology I teachers will                     
              attend awareness sessions (1-2 hours), 440 Biology I                           
              teachers will participate in four day workshops, and 90                        
              Biology I teachers will participate in three three-week                        
              summer institutes (held at Texas A&M and other regional                        
              sites).                                                                        
                                                                                             
              Cost sharing equals 14.8% of the NSF award.
