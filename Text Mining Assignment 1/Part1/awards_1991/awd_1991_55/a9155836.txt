Abstract    :
              Design is being incorporated into the engineering curriculum as                
              a focusing and attracting mechanism from the very first                        
              engineering courses up to the traditional capstone courses.                    
              This pilot project begins with the introduction of design                      
              concepts in the required freshman algorithms and computer                      
              programming course.  This new design paradigm is comprised of                  
              three phases or stages:  (1) By Design:  Captivating Engineers-                
              -the student will solve broad-area or concept problems using                   
              computers to simulate the results of his/her actions; (2) By                   
              Design:  Creative Engineers--at this stage the student                         
              integrates what he/she has learned and is encouraged to work in                
              groups; (3) By Design:  Analytical Engineers--at this stage the                
              student investigates the design considerations in fine detail,                 
              integrating the tools gathered throughout his/her undergraduate                
              studies, and learns how the tools formerly employed are                        
              fashioned.  A thorough outcomes assessment plan is designed to                 
              track student's performance.
