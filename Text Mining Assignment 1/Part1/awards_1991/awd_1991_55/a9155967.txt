Abstract    :
              This instructional software package, called Populus, is                        
              designed to support university courses in ecology and                          
              evolutionary biology, and has proven to be an extremely                        
              successful pedagogical tool in several institutions, worldwide.                
              The goals of this project are to move research techniques into                 
              the classroom, using computer simulations to reduce mathematics                
              anxieties by providing concrete demonstrations of dynamic                      
              behavior in a graphical and intuitively understandable way,                    
              allowing students to "play" with a model by running different                  
              parameter values until they understand the model's behavior.                   
              The PIs are expanding and enhancing an earlier version of                      
              Populus, which currently consists of 30 major models that span                 
              introductory to advanced topics in ecology and evolution.  The                 
              intention is to thoroughly convert the program using "object                   
              oriented" programming techniques, which will lay the foundation                
              for further development, and to improve and add new simulations                
              modules and make functional additions to the program shell.                    
              They intend to build toward a product containing 50-60 modules.
