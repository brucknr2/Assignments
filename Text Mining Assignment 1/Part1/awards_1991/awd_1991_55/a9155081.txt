              Bridgewater State College will initiate a six-week, residential,               
              Early Alert Initiative Young Scholars project in Mathematics and               
              Physics which will offer science enrichment activities for 40                  
              female precollege students entering grade 7.                                   
                                                                                             
              This program will emphasize investigations and communications in               
              mathematics and physics.  In addition to the summer activities,                
              participants will take part in an academic year component during               
              which they will visit career sites and work with career mentors.               
              They also will work in teams supervised by teacher mentors on a                
              series of mathematics and physics projects related to topics such              
              as fiber optics.
