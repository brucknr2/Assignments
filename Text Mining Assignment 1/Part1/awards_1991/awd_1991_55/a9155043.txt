Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The University of Kansas, Lawrence Campus, will initiate a five-               
              week, residential Young Scholars project in Life Science and                   
              Mathematics for 25 students entering grade 12.                                 
                                                                                             
              Class activities will integrate studies of genetics, statistics,               
              writing and bioethics to encourage in students an understanding of             
              the relationship among genetics, technology and society.  Students             
              will be assigned to various task-centered groups to facilitate                 
              cooperative learning.  Group activities will include solving                   
              genetics and statistics problems, working on interactive computer              
              exercises and developing a bioethics project to be presented as a              
              follow-up activity in the students' high schools.  Hands-on                    
              laboratory experiments in genetics will help the students to                   
              experience the joys of scientific discovery.
