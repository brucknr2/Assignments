Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              Wesleyan University will conduct a two-year project to                         
              pilot-test a new teacher enhancement model: "In-School                         
              Inservice Institute in Math and Science".  Over 180 high                       
              school mathematics and science teachers in twelve                              
              Connecticut school districts will receive three weeks of                       
              intensive, on-site inservice and professional development                      
              during the school year by a visiting team of two university                    
              faculty and six Project to Increase Mastery of Mathematics                     
              and Science (PIMMS) master teachers and other expert                           
              demonstrators.  Participating teachers will conduct a                          
              variety of outreach activities for over 1800 second-wave                       
              teachers, for a total enhanced population of about 2000.                       
                                                                                             
              Two distinguishing features of the project are its collegial                   
              aspect and its team teaching approach.  A member of the                        
              Visiting Team will team up with a participant, with the                        
              Visiting Team member teaching the participant's classes                        
              while the participant is attending seminars and                                
              demonstrations or observes a colleague's class.  Visitor and                   
              participant will also team-teach classes throughout the                        
              school day and will spend time discussing and reflecting                       
              upon the day's activities.  Thus, the Visiting Team should                     
              learn as much about secondary mathematics and science                          
              instruction as the high school teachers will learn about                       
              mathematics and science.                                                       
                                                                                             
              This in-school, collegial model has potential for success in                   
              a variety of settings.  Wesleyan University, PIMMS and                         
              school district cost-sharing accounts for 92% of the NSF                       
              budget.
