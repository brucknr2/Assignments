Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              In response to a State mandate that a third science course,                    
              earth/environmental science, be required in West Virginia a                    
              program to enhance teachers' ability to teach earth science                    
              has been developed.  To assist secondary teachers with this                    
              new responsibility a series of 8 summer workshops in earth                     
              science are proposed for 1992, 1993, and 1994.  Each 12-day                    
              workshop will serve 20 teachers (160 total).  The workshops                    
              will include:  a survey of earth science topics, expert                        
              lectures, lab exercises, field trips, and activities to                        
              improve teaching shills and encourage professional growth.  A                  
              resource "kit" for the participants will be developed.  Mentor                 
              teaches will also be prepared to conduct workshops in their                    
              home area.  This project will be operated by the Department of                 
              Education, and the West Virginia University Department of                      
              Geology and Geography.
