Abstract    :
              Software packages are being developed for an introductory                      
              linear algebra course.  These materials provide undergraduate                  
              science, engineering, and mathematics students tools to                        
              understand linear algebra and its applications.  Using the                     
              materials, students investigate ideas and explore patterns to                  
              understand the underlying mathematical concepts and                            
              applications. Manuals introduce the students to important                      
              algorithms and to a broad range of models including, for                       
              example, demography, traffic flow, and the Leontief model for                  
              analyzing the interdependence of industries.
