Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Tech Museum of Innovation will conduct at its facilities                   
              in San Jose, CA a three-year project "Extending Science                        
              Education: Teaching With and About Technology".  Twenty                        
              middle school and twenty high school science teachers per                      
              year from northern and southern California will work with                      
              industry experts and museum staff to learn about latest                        
              innovations and developments, having access to industry                        
              research and development facilities through  summer workshop                   
              activities including behind-the-scenes tours and hands-on                      
              labs at the Museum that replicate industry applications                        
              useful in biology, computer science, chemistry, physics, and                   
              mathematics taught at participants' schools.                                   
                                                                                             
              "Challenge activities" based upon these real-world                             
              applications will be developed by each of forty, four-person                   
              teams beginning in the two-week summer workshop for the                        
              teacher-participant and then completed and implemented by a                    
              team formed by that teacher with three other teachers of                       
              science. They are supported by a mid-year teleconference of                    
              participants, project staff, and industry experts in                           
              addition to at least one half-day coaching visit and "as-                      
              needed" consultation by project staff and industry experts.                    
              Dissemination includes each of the 120 participants                            
              receiving the publication of all 120 challenge activities as                   
              well as presenting their projects in person at a spring fair                   
              open to all teachers and community members.                                    
                                                                                             
              Cost sharing by the museum, school districts, and industry                     
              accounts for 88.7% of the NSF budget contribution.
