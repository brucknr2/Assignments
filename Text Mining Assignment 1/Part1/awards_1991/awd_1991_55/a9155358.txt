Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The grant funds a 3 year project to develop a nationwide                       
              network for science teachers based on the work done with                       
              LabNet.  The primary purpose of the network is to promote                      
              project-enhanced among the accessible features.  Of the 1,375                  
              teachers and the rest are high school teachers.                                
                                                                                             
              The project produces a self-sustaining community of science                    
              teachers who are network users.  This "community of practice"                  
              provides the basis for indepth studies on the uses of networks                 
              and produces a usable workshop model and materials.  Research                  
              on the network users provides an understanding of how                          
              networks, and eventually Internet, is used to improve                          
              classroom science instruction.
