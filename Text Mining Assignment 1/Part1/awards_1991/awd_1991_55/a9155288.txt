Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This National Science Foundation grant was designed to expand                  
              NACME's existing information program to reach more teachers,                   
              counselors and parents of minority students at the junior and                  
              senior high school levels and, ultimately, to provide more and                 
              better information to the students themselves.                                 
                                                                                             
              Materials produced under the grant to convey the message that                  
              minority students can find rewarding, attainable careers in                    
              mathematics and science-based fields, that financial aid is                    
              available to help students prepare for such careers, that there                
              are specific academic prerequisites for students interested in                 
              studying engineering at the college-level, and that there is a                 
              growing network of programs to encourage the study of                          
              engineering and related technical fields among under represented               
              minority students.
