Abstract    :
              We propose to develop an investigative-type biology laboratory                 
              for non-majors based on commonly held misconceptions about life                
              science.  Each laboratory session will center on a single naive                
              preconception commonly held by students.  The students will                    
              formulate a null hypothesis and design and perform experiments                 
              to test this preconception.  Students will obtain results which                
              conflict with their preconceptions, allowing them to discover                  
              for themselves that logical experiments do not support their                   
              naive beliefs. Improvement in general scientific literacy                      
              should occur as a result of active student participation in all                
              phases of this unique process.   This new investigative                        
              approach will require an intensive graduate assistant training                 
              program for successful implementation.
