              Abstract                                                                       
                                                                                             
              The University of Arizona offers a four year program to                        
              enhance the mathematical and pedagogical competence and                        
              leadership skills of 90 well prepared middle school teachers.                  
              Special emphases will include encouraging minorities and women                 
              in mathematics, using technology in doing mathematics, and                     
              exploring connections of mathematics to other areas.  Each                     
              teacher will attend two summer workshops (one four week and                    
              one two week) and be engaged in academic year activities to                    
              support classroom implementation and further develop                           
              leadership skills.  Courses in the summer workshops will be                    
              co-taught by university faculty and classroom teachers.                        
              Teachers participating in the project will provide outreach                    
              and support for other teachers.                                                
                                                                                             
              The university and schools are providing a cost share of 34%.
