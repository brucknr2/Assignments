Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal provides activities designed to increase the                     
              quality and quantity of science taught in the high school                      
              classrooms and laboratories in Southwest Louisiana and                         
              Southeast Texas.  The program consists of three components:                    
              (a) workshops in biology, chemistry, and physical science                      
              designed to provide the participants with the methodology and                  
              motivation to improve the quality and quantity of instruction;                 
              (b) peer enhancement activities designed to provide                            
              participants opportunities to effectively share their learning                 
              experiences with their peers; and (c) model development                        
              activities designed for the in-service training of teachers in                 
              the local school system.  This program will be for three years                 
              and will involve 102 high school teachers of biology,                          
              chemistry, and physical science.                                               
                                                                                             
              Cost sharing is equivalent to 44% of the NSF award.
