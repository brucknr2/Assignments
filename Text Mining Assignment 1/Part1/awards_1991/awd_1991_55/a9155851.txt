Abstract    :
              Oberlin College will continue the development of two                           
              laboratory-based introductory courses for the computer science                 
              major started with a previous UCC grant of one year.  This                     
              project supports a faculty member for the development of the                   
              laboratory materials, and student laboratory assistants during                 
              the period of the grant.  The two courses follow the                           
              recommendations of the recent ACM/IEEE report Computing                        
              Curriculum '91, and gives emphasis to algorithms and conceptual                
              development of the introductory material.  The laboratory                      
              sessions are used to make the courses more realistic                           
              introductions to the broad range of topics that make up                        
              computer science, and to speed up and enhance the students'                    
              learning of technical matters that require hands-on experience.                
              These changes are expected to make the courses more                            
              interesting, more useful, and more accurate reflections of the                 
              field, and to create a positive effect on the number of women                  
              and minorities majoring in computer science.
