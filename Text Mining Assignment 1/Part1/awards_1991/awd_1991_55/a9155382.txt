Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This two year project, sponsored by the University of Lowell,                  
              will provide science teachers, grades 4-12, the expertise to                   
              carryout alternative testing techniques to assess student                      
              learning in the sciences.  The new assessment methods will                     
              enable teachers to discover what students know and thus to                     
              reshape student learning toward better comprehension of                        
              science concepts, more appreciation of the field of science                    
              and enhanced skills in scientific inquiry.  In the first year                  
              of the project 15 teachers will attend a series of workshops                   
              devoted to the concepts and practice of appropriate                            
              assessment techniques.  In the second year of the project the                  
              teachers will implement these techniques in the classroom.                     
              They will also work with selected peer teachers in workshops                   
              managed by project staff to disseminate the techniques to a                    
              wider group of teachers.  At the conclusion of the project                     
              there will be 45 teachers using high quality alternative                       
              assessments in their own classrooms and assisting peers to do                  
              the same.                                                                      
                                                                                             
              The NSF funds are being matched by the University and                          
              participating schools by an amount equivalent to 80% of the                    
              NSF grant.
