Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Case Western Reserve University will initiate a four-week,                 
              summer commuter Young Scholars project in Physics and Engineering              
              for 24 students entering grades 11 and 12.                                     
                                                                                             
              At the heart of the institute is a program of individual student               
              research projects carried out in the laboratories and under the                
              direction of physics and engineering researchers at CWRU, NASA                 
              Lewis Research Center, and one other local research facility.  A               
              week-long physics content component strongly emphasizing guided                
              inquiry laboratory work and sessions on research methodology will              
              precede the commencement of the research projects; the content                 
              sessions attend to both physics fundamentals and topics in current             
              research.  Career exploration activities include field trips to                
              government and private research labs, a hospital medical physics               
              department, and a nuclear power plant; guest presentations by                  
              academic and industrial science professionals will offer further               
              opportunities for students to hear career perspectives from                    
              practicing scientists and engineers in both research and education.
