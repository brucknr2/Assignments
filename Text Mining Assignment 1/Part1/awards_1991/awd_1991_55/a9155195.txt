Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project, sponsored by the Center for Science,                             
              Mathematics and Technology Education at Colorado State                         
              University, will offer a three year interdisciplinary science                  
              program to 40 middle school and junior high school teachers                    
              from representative districts in the state of Colorado.  Each                  
              summer these teachers will be taught the fundamental concepts                  
              of biology, chemistry, geology, mathematics and physics                        
              appropriate to the grade level using a content intensive                       
              thematic approach.  In the academic year following the summer                  
              program the participants, with the help of project staff,                      
              will work toward implementing the new curriculum in their                      
              schools.  They will do this by incorporating the new modules                   
              into the everyday curriculum, by conducting whole school                       
              projects and by offering teacher-to-teacher workshops.  When                   
              the project is completed there will remain a cadre of teacher                  
              leaders who will be able to disseminate innovative                             
              instructional models for middle school interdisciplinary                       
              science.                                                                       
                                                                                             
              The NSF award is being matched with funds from the school                      
              districts and the university by an amount equivalent to 52%                    
              of the NSF grant.
