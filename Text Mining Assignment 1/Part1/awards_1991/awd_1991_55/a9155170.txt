Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal provides for the enhancement of minority                         
              student achievement in the science classroom.  It is a                         
              continuation of the summer and academic year portion of the                    
              Institute for Multicultural Science Education for two years,                   
              rotating a cycle of 30 new teachers and 30 returning                           
              teachers each summer.  Science teachers from the Madison and                   
              Milwaukee school districts will meet in Madison with                           
              Institute staff and faculty for four weeks during the summer                   
              to develop instruction in three areas that are predicted to                    
              enhance the science classroom environment for minority                         
              students.  The Institute is designed to foster changes in                      
              teachers' attitudes (toward minorities, role of teachers,                      
              organization of classroom), and empower the teachers to                        
              develop the skills necessary to put those attitudes into                       
              practice.  The three areas in which teachers will work are:                    
              (1) developing greater understanding of the strengths and                      
              needs of minority students; and investigating the                              
              applicability of (2) the cooperative learning approach and                     
              (3) the problem solving approach to enrichment of                              
              multicultural science classrooms.  Throughout the Institute,                   
              teachers will themselves learn in the cooperative                              
              learning/problem solving mode, with continuing attention to                    
              the needs of minority students.  The major task will be to                     
              develop new instructional units for teaching their science                     
              classes the following year utilizing those modes.                              
                                                                                             
              Cost sharing is equivalent to 52% of the NSF award.
