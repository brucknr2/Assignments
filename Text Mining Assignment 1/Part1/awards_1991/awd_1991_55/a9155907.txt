Abstract    :
              The project will accomplish three objectives:  (1) development                 
              of innovative methods for interactive teaching and testing                     
              engineering students by computer; (2) development of courseware                
              in Statics , a mandatory lower division course for the majority                
              of engineering students); and (3) testing, modifying, and                      
              implementing the courseware.  Alabama A&M University at Normal,                
              Alabama, and Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville are                  
              the project subcontractors.  They are now teaching these                       
              courses to a large number of students with  diverse backgrounds                
              and will be participating in the development, testing, and                     
              dissemination of the courseware.  Five problem-solving oriented                
              lessons and 5 examinations in a cT-version for stand-alone                     
              computers (Macintosh and PC) and a NovaNET system version, will                
              present students with new problems each time the lessons are                   
              used.  Students will be able to work problems on their own,                    
              supported by continuous and appropriate feedback throughout the                
              problem solving process.  Instead of multiple-choice tests,                    
              sophisticated constructed student responses such as algebraic                  
              expressions, sentences, and cursor location will be judged by                  
              computer. These innovative instructional materials will be                     
              disseminated to other engineering schools all of which teach                   
              the Statics course.
