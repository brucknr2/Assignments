Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Girls Inc. will develop a national model summer program for                    
              girls aged 12 to 16 to encourage their interest in science,                    
              their enrollment in science courses in high school, and                        
              their interest in science careers.  The recruitment of girls                   
              from low-income and minority families as participants will                     
              be a high priority.  The program will represent a synthesis                    
              of Operation Smart, an afterschool science and mathematics                     
              program, and Eureka Teen Achievement Program, which                            
              introduces science and mathematics in summer programs                          
              through sports.  The program will be developed and field-                      
              tested in five diverse Girls inc. sites around the country                     
              and to other interested groups.  Substantial formative and                     
              impact evaluation is planned.
