Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              To address environmental problems in the educational sphere,                   
              the Lawrence Hall of Science located in Berkeley, California                   
              will be conducting a three-year project consisting of five                     
              summer institutes.  The institutes will serve a total of 125                   
              teacher-leaders who will incorporate a course in Global                        
              Systems Science into existing high school programs in their                    
              regions.  Further, these teacher-leaders will assist in the                    
              education of their colleagues across the nation.  The project                  
              will begin by inviting 25 teachers to pilot test the Global                    
              Systems Science materials during the summer of 1992.  These                    
              participants will help shape the instructional materials and                   
              several of them will return as staff members during the                        
              subsequent summer institutes.  During 1993 and 1994, a total                   
              of four additional institutes will last three weeks and                        
              accommodate 25 teacher-leaders.  The Global Systems Science                    
              course materials will form the core curriculum.  Participants                  
              in all five institutes will visit laboratories and learn                       
              "first hand" about the work of professionals who investigate                   
              such topics as global climate change, energy efficiency, ozone                 
              depletion, and other topics.  These participants will also                     
              receive instruction in how to assess learning, and how to                      
              become a leader in their district.
