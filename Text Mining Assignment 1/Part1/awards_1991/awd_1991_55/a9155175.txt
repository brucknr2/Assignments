Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal is directed at providing teachers with a direct                  
              "hands-on" experience with field science.  The program is                      
              designed to involve 180 teachers in grades 5-8 in summer and                   
              academic year workshops on marine biology and provide them                     
              with opportunities to engage in research emphasizing the use                   
              of mathematics for problem solving in science.  During the                     
              summer the teachers will be involved in field experiences in                   
              biology and marine mammal science that will expose them to                     
              data gathering and research methodology. Teachers will develop                 
              knowledge and skills in hypothesis formation, data collection,                 
              and analysis.  The teachers will build on the summer                           
              experience during the academic year by being involved in                       
              curriculum development and the development of computer                         
              simulations, analysis programs and approaches and models which                 
              they adapt to classroom situations to make science interesting                 
              and exciting for their students.  The approach is                              
              interdisciplinary emphasizing the use of mathematics in                        
              science.
