Abstract    :
              This project between the College of Education and the College                  
              of Engineering develops models and examples that incorporate                   
              new science and engineering materials for use in preparation of                
              future teachers of K-12 science. The materials which are                       
              developed are drawn from recent research in the area of                        
              Bioengineering which focuses on such topics as : rehabilitation                
              engineering , bioacoustics, biomaterials computational                         
              neurosciences, bioinstrumentation and medical imaging. The                     
              materials which are developed are used in courses in science                   
              teaching in the College of Education and are also integrated                   
              into the introductory Bioengineering course in the College of                  
              Engineering. The materials are also considered for adaptation                  
              to a form appropriate for direct use by students in the K-12                   
              curriculum.
