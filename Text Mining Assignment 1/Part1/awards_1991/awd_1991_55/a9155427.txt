Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This three year project, sponsored by the Social Science                       
              Education Consortium in cooperation with the Science                           
              Discovery Program at the University of Colorado-Boulder,                       
              will implement an interdisciplinary science and social                         
              studies program whose curriculum emphasizes the analysis of                    
              local community problems, presents an understanding of the                     
              science issues behind these problems and encourages student                    
              development of community action projects to help solve                         
              them.  In the first two years teams from nine school                           
              districts, selected from the states of Arizona, Colorado                       
              and New Mexico, consisting of middle school science and                        
              social science teachers and school administrators, will                        
              study science and social science content in a four week                        
              summer session. The teams will carry out inservice projects                    
              to implement the program during the academic years                             
              following each summer session.  In the third year two                          
              resource books for teachers, one for the life science                          
              curriculum and one for the earth science curriculum, will be                   
              prepared by the project staff.  The content will be based in                   
              part on what was found to be successful in the program                         
              implementation process.                                                        
                                                                                             
              Matching funds from the consortium and the school districts                    
              amount to more than 29% of the NSF grant.
