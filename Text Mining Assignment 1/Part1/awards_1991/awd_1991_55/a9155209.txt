              provide a four week summer programs for thirty teachers each                   
              year to learn the basic science concepts of modern psychology.

              learning, memory and cognition.  In the project teachers will                  
              learn how to set up laboratory experiments, carry out                          
              classroom demonstrations and learn statistical principles to                   
              illustrate psychology concepts to their students.  By the end                  
              of the summer the teachers will have developed lesson plans in                 
              each topic area and will be given curriculum materials which                   
              can be used upon returning to the schools.  the follow-up                      
              portion of the project includes presentation of teaching                       
              modules at regional workshops and classroom visits by project

              the classroom.
