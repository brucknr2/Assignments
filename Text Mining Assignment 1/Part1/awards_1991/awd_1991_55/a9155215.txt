Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Dr. Robert Howard is the Chairman of the Chemistry                             
              Department of the University of Tulsa, and an active                           
              proponent of high quality science instruction in elementary                    
              schools.  Dr. Howard has organized and conducted several                       
              teacher enhancement workshops for elementary teachers from                     
              the region adjacent to Tulsa, and he has planned a                             
              three-year series of workshops for elementary teachers                         
              across the entire state of Oklahoma. Underprepared teachers                    
              will be offered a five-week workshop experience, during                        
              which they will be exposed to exemplary instructional                          
              materials and the most current approaches to inquiry-based                     
              teaching methods.  The teachers will develop their own                         
              lesson plans based on these proven instructional materials,                    
              and will conduct classes for children in a practicum                           
              setting.  The following summer these same teachers will have                   
              a more advanced five-week workshop that will prepare them to                   
              act as lead teachers in their home school districts.                           
                                                                                             
              The proposed workshops will create a cadre of 150 trained                      
              leader teachers across Oklahoma.  Each of these teachers                       
              will be capable of catalyzing change in their own schools                      
              and school districts. The use of teachers as trainers and                      
              mentors of other teachers is a highly effective means of                       
              effecting broadly-based improvements in science instruction.                   
                                                                                             
              The cost sharing by the host institution amounts to 127% of                    
              the NSF support.
