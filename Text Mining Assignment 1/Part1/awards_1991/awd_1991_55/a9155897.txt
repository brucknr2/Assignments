Abstract    :
              An educational computer program is to be constructed that will                 
              enable students to observe and manipulate the internal                         
              mechanisms of a simulated computer software and hardware                       
              system.  The program will enable students to view the workings                 
              of the compiler as it translates source language to machine                    
              language and the machine architecture as it executes the                       
              machine instructions.                                                          
                                                                                             
              The system will also provide the basis for a number of                         
              exercises for students who will be able to modify the existing                 
              simulation or create their own mechanisms.                                     
                                                                                             
              The purpose of the system is to support the teaching of the                    
              first course in computer science for all students.  It is                      
              expected to facilitate the teaching of the fundamental                         
              mechanisms of computing to an unusual level for such first                     
              courses.  The design of the system grows out of a course                       
              developed at Duke over the past five years which is now being                  
              adopted at many major colleges and universities.
