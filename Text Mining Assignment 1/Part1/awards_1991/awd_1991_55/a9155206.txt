Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project is a five year program that will develop twelve                   
              field tested, open-ended research projects that can be used                    
              by biology teachers as investigative science projects with                     
              first year biology students.  The research projects will be                    
              developed by biology teachers working with laboratory                          
              scientists at the North Carolina Research Triangle Park and                    
              in the Washington, D.C. area.  The National Association of                     
              Biology Teachers will coordinate the project.                                  
                                                                                             
              Twelve teams of two teachers will be paired with a scientist                   
              from a university or industry and work in their laboratory                     
              for three weeks during the summer of 1993.  During this time                   
              the team will work with the researcher to develop a simple,                    
              low cost,  open-ended research project that can be used in                     
              their classroom.  The teachers will gain hands-on experience                   
              with the procedures in the laboratory of the scientist and                     
              then field test the experiment with their own students                         
              during the following academic year and modify it as needed.                    
                                                                                             
              A special education teacher will work with the NABT staff to                   
              modify the projects for students with special needs, and the                   
              projects will then be field tested nationwide.  Input from                     
              the nationwide testing will then be used to modify the                         
              projects further.  They will then be compiled into a                           
              monograph which will be made available to biology teachers                     
              nationwide.  Project results will be disseminated through                      
              inservice workshops at national and state science teacher                      
              conventions and in local school districts.                                     
                                                                                             
              Cost sharing equals 16.8% of the NSF award.
