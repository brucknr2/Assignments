Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              This project is a three-year teacher enhancement program                       
              targeting middle/high school science and mathematics teachers                  
              who are interested in the incorporation of real-time                           
              environmental data in their classroom activities.  The project                 
              activities will be conducted at the University of Oklahoma                     
              campus.  This multi-disciplinary project will combine                          
              meteorology, climatology, computer graphics,                                   
              telecommunications, geography, geology, and agriculture in a                   
              series of applied environmental activities.  This project will                 
              utilize the existing Oklahoma Mesonetwork, an array of 107                     
              automated environmental monitoring stations.  For each year of                 
              the project, the project will provide the tools for                            
              initiation, implementation, and evaluation of the use of                       
              Mesonet data in participant classrooms by offering:  a) a                      
              three-day computer course, b) a three-week teacher education                   
              institute and curriculum development session, c) a two-day                     
              science fair and conference during the following school year,                  
              d) a computer newsletter, e) a computer bulletin board and e-                  
              mail system for teachers, and f) a continuing mentorship                       
              program.  In addition to the National Science Foundation, this                 
              project is supported by the State of Oklahoma, Oklahoma                        
              University, local school districts, and Atmospheric Radiation                  
              Monitoring project (US Department of Energy).
