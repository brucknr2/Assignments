Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal provides a plan for the enhancement of the                       
              scientific skills of outstanding middle school teachers of                     
              grades 7 and 8 in physical science.  These teachers will later                 
              assist in improving the teaching practices of their less                       
              experienced colleagues through the development of Science                      
              Teacher Leaders Resource Teams.  Direct participation will                     
              involve 182 middle school teachers.  A major objective of the                  
              project is to provide staff development for science resource                   
              teachers that includes sequenced courses on key scientific                     
              concepts, principles, and ways of thinking; directed research                  
              in scientific problem-solving; and classroom practice in                       
              science, especially content-based inquiry science.                             
                                                                                             
              Cost sharing is equivalent to 22% of the NSF award.
