Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The University of Wisconsin @ Superior will initiate a five-week,              
              residential Young Scholars project in Mathematics, Chemistry and               
              the Life Sciences which will provide science enrichment activities             
              for 20 precollege students entering grades 11 and 12.                          
                                                                                             
              This summer program will emphasize research participation in                   
              mathematical modeling and exploratory data analysis involving acid             
              rain data.  Students will use techniques of exploratory data                   
              analysis and linear regression to analyze National Atmospheric                 
              Deposition Program (NADP) data.  Participants will use computers to            
              develop models of the pH of acid rain.  Students will be introduced            
              to the sources of pollutants, the chemistry of acid deposition, and            
              the effects of acidification.  During a two-day campout near acid-             
              sensitive lakes in Wisconsin, students will inspect an NADP                    
              sampling station and the Little Rock acidification project.
