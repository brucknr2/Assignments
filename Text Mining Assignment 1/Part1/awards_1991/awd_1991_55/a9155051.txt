Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Francis Marion College will initiate a three-week, residential                 
              Young Scholars project in Physics which will offer science                     
              enrichment activities for 25 precollege students entering grade 12.            
                                                                                             
              The program will include individual research projects in nuclear               
              physics, laser physics, x-ray diffraction, solid state                         
              conductivity, ultraviolet spectroscopy, superconductivity, and                 
              engineering physics.  This will be reinforced with classroom                   
              discussions and group laboratories on topics such as lasers,                   
              quantum mechanics, special relativity, elementary particle physics,            
              superconductivity, atomic/nuclear structure, and astrophysics.
