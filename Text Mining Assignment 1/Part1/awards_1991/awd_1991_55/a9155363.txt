Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This two year program, sponsored by the University of                          
              Arizona, will offer a three week program in techniques of                      
              instrumentation to 30 outstanding high school chemistry                        
              teachers selection from a national pool of applicants.  In                     
              the summer program teachers will learn how scientific                          
              instruments work, how they can be used, and what chemical                      
              processes they demonstrate.  The project also supports                         
              follow up activities by providing components for the                           
              instruments, by providing curriculum materials for the                         
              workshops, and by arranging for industrial mentors to help                     
              the teachers conduct the workshops.                                            
                                                                                             
              The matching funds from the university and participating                       
              schools amount to about 25% of the NSF grant.
