Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              Indiana University is offering a three year program on mathematical            
              modeling for 90 high school mathematics teachers (30 each year).               
              Each year's program includes a four week summer institute with                 
              focus both on developing basic ideas and tools for mathematical                
              modeling and their use in various modeling projects, and also on               
              developing classroom implementation plans and materials.  Six                  
              teachers from a Summer 1991 pilot project will serve as                        
              participant-leaders and mentors in the first institute; teachers               
              from each of the summer institutes will similarly serve in the                 
              subsequent institute.  Follow-up activities include staff site                 
              visits and two follow-up meetings each year.                                   
                                                                                             
              Cost sharing equivalent to approximately 24% of the award is                   
              provided by the university and schools.
