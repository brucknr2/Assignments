Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Discovery Center is a "hands-on" science museum with a                     
              mission to provide the public with a basic science literacy.                   
              The proposed HOFPP project is an outreach program that will take               
              an informal science education activity to disadvantaged parents                
              and children in the facilities of four (first year)                            
              collaborating "parents":  The Urban League, the Spanish Action                 
              League, the North American Indian Club and Girls Inc. of Central               
              NY.  The purpose of the program is to encourage and enable                     
              parents of disadvantaged school children to play an active role                
              in their child child's education.  Phase I of the program is                   
              implemented as a series of ten weekly classes in which parents                 
              and children will work together on hands-on science activities;                
              Phase 2 follows with a science club program.  Graduates will be                
              informally channeled into an inner-city magnet school for                      
              science and math.  Past Discovery Center outreach programs have                
              already demonstrated ability to attract disadvantaged parents.                 
              The proposed program will touch 1,000 disadvantaged persons                    
              during the initial three-year period.  During the third year the               
              HOFPP project will be transported and implemented at a Science                 
              museum in another New York State community.                                    
                                                                                             
              A three year cost-shared NSF project is proposed that will be                  
              later sustained by The Discovery Center operating budget with                  
              local donations.  A professional outside evaluation will be                    
              performed to measure program success.  Program reports,                        
              materials and consultation will be propagated to other                         
              interested organizations to gain maximum impact.
