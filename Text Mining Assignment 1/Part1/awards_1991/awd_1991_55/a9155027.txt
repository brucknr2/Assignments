Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Center for American Archaeology will initiate a six-week,                  
              residential Young Scholars project in Archeology for 30 students               
              entering grades 11 and 12.                                                     
                                                                                             
              Participants will be introduced to all aspects of archeological                
              research, with special emphasis being given to the role                        
              geomorphology, botany, zoology, bioanthropology and other such                 
              disciplines play in understanding past societies.  Field and                   
              experimental activities will be part of the ongoing program                    
              conducted by the CAA's Education Program.  Students will spend                 
              three weeks excavating at the 6000-year-old Quasar site.  In the               
              laboratory, participants will work with respected professional                 
              scientists collecting and analyzing cultural, biological and                   
              geological data for independent research projects that can                     
              contribute to the overall research goals of the Center for American            
              Archaeology.
