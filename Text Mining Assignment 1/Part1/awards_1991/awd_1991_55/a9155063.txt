Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Florida Institute of Technology will initiate a four-week,                 
              residential Young Scholars project in Environmental Science for 20             
              students entering grades 10-12.                                                
                                                                                             
              The program combines challenging academic work with extensive field            
              experiences and stimulating physical challenges.  Participants                 
              apply scientific principles to real-life environmental problems                
              while exploring the unique and diverse habitats of Central Florida             
              and the Great Smoky Mountains.  Academic work focuses on                       
              environmental science but includes related topics from resource                
              management, conservation biology, and research methodology.  Field             
              experiences will emphasize the development of the knowledge, skills            
              and techniques needed to prepare ecosystem profiles of natural                 
              communities.  In follow-up activities participants will prepare                
              ecosystem profiles of natural communities near their home or                   
              school, make comparisons with communities studied during the                   
              summer, and prepare and present a report of their findings in their            
              own schools.
