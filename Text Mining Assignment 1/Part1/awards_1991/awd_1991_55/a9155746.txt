Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This research project examines how elementary, high school,                    
              and college students develop intuitive conceptions about                       
              calculus--which in this case is broadly defined as the                         
              mathematics of change and variation.  The central assumption                   
              is that, from an early age, people develop models about how                    
              things change.  Mathematics instruction must build upon                        
              these intuitive models.  The method of investigation                           
              involves sequences of teaching interviews in which                             
              individual students are presented with problems about                          
              situations of change such as the motion of cars, flow of                       
              water, or plant growth.  They are given physical materials                     
              and software tools to help them experiment with the                            
              problems.  Researchers observe and videotape the ensuing                       
              discussion, use of materials, and student-constructed                          
              representations of the solution.  Subsequent analysis                          
              focuses on students' constructions of the problem, the ideas                   
              that guide their predictions, the resources they use, and                      
              the principles they generate to verify predictions and                         
              explanations.  The project's findings will help mathematics                    
              educators rethink the ways in which calculus is currently                      
              taught, as well as the age levels at which key calculus                        
              ideas are introduced.  Results will also feed directly into                    
              a major elementary mathematics curriculum, in the form of a                    
              curriculum strand about "change."
