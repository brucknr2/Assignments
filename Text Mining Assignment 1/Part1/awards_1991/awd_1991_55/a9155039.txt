Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Boston University will initiate a six-week, commuter and                       
              residential Young Scholars project in Physics and Engineering which            
              will provide science enrichment activities for 30 students entering            
              grades 11 and 12.                                                              
                                                                                             
              Students will participate in research at laboratories affiliated               
              with Boston University and MIT, where they will be placed for six              
              weeks during the summer after either their sophomore or junior                 
              years.  This age group is chosen because of its maturity and its               
              ability to share the summer experience with fellow high school                 
              students during their senior year.  This program for high-ability              
              secondary school students will be coordinated by Boston University,            
              where the participants will live for the duration of the project.              
              The object of this program is for the students to become aware of              
              the realities of a scientific career through involvement in                    
              research and exposure to questions at the frontiers of knowledge               
              and to the methods and ideas used to answer them.  To this purpose,            
              each participant will be paired with a mentor -- a person actively             
              engaged in research -- and will work with him or her in ongoing                
              research problems.  A series of weekly seminars will provide a more            
              global view of problems in science.
