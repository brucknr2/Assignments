              The University of Central Florida and Martin Marietta                          
              Corporation have formed a partnership resulting in the                         
              founding of UCF/Martin Marietta Academy.  The aim is to                        
              improve mathematics and science education in K-8 public                        
              schools in three Central Florida counties.

              courses, which will include mathematics and science content,                   
              pedagogical aspects of teaching mathematics and science and                    
              leadership training.
