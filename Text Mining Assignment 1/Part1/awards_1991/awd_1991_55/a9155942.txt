Abstract    :
              Six faculty members from several departments are developing a                  
              multidisciplinary two term course sequence titled "Interactive                 
              Earth Systems".  The two courses at the introductory level, are                
              intended to help beginning college students understand that                    
              scientific knowledge is applicable to their lives and is                       
              important for contemporary human society.  Students are                        
              introduced to an understanding of the evolving earth and its                   
              environments via four key concepts, each introduced by a                       
              specific case study: the nature of earth systems and                           
              interactions; cycles and flows in the earth systems; long time-                
              scale changes; and human interactions and catastrophic events.                 
              A special feature of the design is the use of individual                       
              modules of learning, each constructed on a specific topic. Each                
              module consists of two one-hour lectures each week and two two-                
              hour sessions in which the students solve specific problems or                 
              answer specific questions in small cooperative groups of 3-4                   
              students.  Students taking these courses are gaining an                        
              understanding of the scientific laws governing changes in the                  
              natural world and the human implications of global changes.
