Abstract    :
              A two-semester introductory level collegiate text is being                     
              developed which introduces students to the principles and                      
              practices of mathematics.  Providing a breadth of mathematics,                 
              a course based on this text would be appropriate for all                       
              students interested in mathematics.  Represented in the text                   
              are various areas of mathematics and applications which are                    
              presented as themes throughout the text, rather than as                        
              distinct subject topics.  The design, review, and field-test of                
              the text is being overseen by the author team and an advisory                  
              board.  The project is also receiving support from the Exxon                   
              Education Foundation.
