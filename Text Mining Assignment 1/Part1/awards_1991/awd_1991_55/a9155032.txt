Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Centralia College will initiate a six-week, commuter,                          
              multidisciplinary Young Scholars project in the Physical and Life              
              Sciences which will offer science enrichment activities for 25                 
              students entering grade 11.                                                    
                                                                                             
              The goal is to provide an experiential learning program for                    
              participants through a water quality research project.  Project                
              activities will center on a study of Salzer Creek, a tributary of              
              the Chehalis River in Southwest Washington state.  Students will               
              calculate water quality, analyze soil samples, test samples of                 
              plants and benthic macroinvertebrates, and conduct stream flow                 
              analysis.  Student research will yield data to be used in local                
              water quality assessments for the Chehalis River Basin Council and             
              to be entered in an international ecology data base.
