Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Austin children's Museum will develop a colorful,                          
              interactive exhibit on energy entitled GO POWER.  Go Power is                  
              being created as part of a U.S. Department of Energy exhibition                
              initiative with in-kind support from the Lower Colorado River                  
              Authority, a non-profit public power agency, and design and                    
              fabrication assistance by the Robot Group, an Austin-based                     
              consortium of engineers and artists.  The partnership, advised                 
              by a panel of science, energy, and education experts, will build               
              a 1,200 square-foot exhibit geared towards young children (pre-                
              school and elementary-age), and their families.  An Exhibit                    
              Developer with a strong scientific background will be                          
              responsible for the design and implementation of exhibit                       
              components which will highlight energy-related science and                     
              technology as a focus for developing and utilizing skills of                   
              scientific inquiry and invention.  Through kinetic sculpture,                  
              computer games, participatory exhibits, and adjunct programming,               
              visitors will learn about potential and kinetic energy and its                 
              forms:  mechanical, electrical, chemical, thermal, solar.                      
              Following its test edition, designed with input from advisors,                 
              front-end evaluations, and prototypes, Go Power will become the                
              sixth exhibit to join the Museum's popular national touring                    
              program.
