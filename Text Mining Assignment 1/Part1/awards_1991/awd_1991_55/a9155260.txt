Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The New York Hall of Science provides a plan for the creation                  
              of a MICROLAB Institute to provide training and ongoing                        
              supporting microbiology education for 7th grade life science                   
              teachers and middle school science supervisors.  Over a period                 
              of three years the program plan to model enhancement of the                    
              quality of instruction in the nation's largest school district                 
              through (1) training in content and pedagogy, (2) ongoing peer                 
              and instructional support, and (3) the continuing provision of                 
              all materials and equipment for successful classroom                           
              implementation of hands-on curricula.  The major goals of the                  
              project are: increase teachers' knowledge of microbiology                      
              concepts; change teaching methodology from rote to                             
              interactive; to develop a New York City-wide ongoing support                   
              network; and to stimulate teachers' own continuing development                 
              of materials for activity-based learning.  Two hundred                         
              teachers and sixty science supervisors will serve as                           
              participants for this project.                                                 
                                                                                             
              Cost sharing is equivalent to 51% of the NSF award.
