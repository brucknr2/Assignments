Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This is a proposal for a cooperative venture involving the                     
              Department of Mathematics, the School of Education, and six                    
              school districts in the Birmingham, AL area to enhance the                     
              mathematics background and pedagogical repertory of 20 (well-                  
              prepared) middle school teachers of mathematics. The program                   
              begins with an intensive five-week workshop in which the                       
              participants will work through topics from pre-algebra, pre-                   
              geometry, and probability and statistics. The use of hands-on                  
              materials and appropriate computer software in teaching will                   
              be stressed. There will be four follow-up workshops during the                 
              succeeding academic year, as well as at least two site visits                  
              by project faculty to each participating teacher's classroom.                  
              Each participating teacher will select a "partner"-teacher to                  
              whom s/he will be mentor during the academic year and with                     
              whom s/he will share ideas and teaching methodologies from the                 
              summer workshop. The program will be replicated in three                       
              successive years: thus, 60 teachers will be impacted directly                  
              and an additional 60 teachers will be impacted through the                     
              partnership-mentoring program. All the teachers will become                    
              part of a network ("Mathematics Teachers Helping Teachers"),                   
              which will continue to function with the support of the                        
              University after the completion of the project.
