Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project, sponsored by the Triangle Coalition, will                        
              replicate the current summer internship program in a broader                   
              group of industries.  In Phase I of the project the Triangle                   
              Coalition will hold a teleconference at 25 sites, selected                     
              to represent a geographic and demographic balance, at which                    
              the process of developing an internship program is                             
              described.  Videotapes will also be produced during this                       
              phase to help in the dissemination of the internship                           
              program.  In Phase II the internships will be developed                        
              through a large scale promotional program and the Triangle                     
              Coalition will put in place a regional consulting network to                   
              help new sites get started.  The matching funds from                           
              business and industry exceed a 10-1 match of the NSF award.
