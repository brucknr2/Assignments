Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This approximately 42-month leadership project is a                            
              cooperative effort of the University of Virginia, and the                      
              Charlottesville City and Albemarle County School Systems.  It                  
              will prepare 20 three-member teams of lead teachers with a                     
              combination of integrated physical science content mastery,                    
              conceptual thinking skills, constructivist learning concepts,                  
              hands-on teaching methods, and leadership abilities.  The                      
              project will be conducted in two over-lapping phases of                        
              approximately 28 months each, and will provide the 60                          
              participating teachers with 270 contact hours (9 credit hours)                 
              in courses that integrate physical science, appropriate                        
              methods of science education, and strategies for effective                     
              leadership.  It is anticipated that all of the 130 K-8                         
              classroom teachers from the Charlottesville City schools, and                  
              many from Albemarle County will be reached through inservices                  
              and support provided by the lead teachers, the principals, and                 
              the project staff.                                                             
                                                                                             
              This leadership project is appropriate for the Teacher                         
              Enhancement Program because of its well-developed plan to                      
              prepare lead teachers in science and, with their assistance,                   
              to provide science inservice for all of the elementary                         
              classroom teachers within the city district and of the                         
              teachers from participating schools in Albemarle County.                       
                                                                                             
              The cost-sharing amount to be contributed by the University of                 
              Virginia is approximately 27% of the amount requested from                     
              NSF.
