Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Harvard College Observatory proposes to create teacher                         
              training videos and workshop materials which will help science                 
              teachers understand and cope with misconceptions in science.                   
              Building on a body of research which has been done in this                     
              area, a series of teacher-training video tapes will be                         
              developed and made available to teachers on a nation wide                      
              basis.  Six 28-minute tapes will address misconceptions in the                 
              fields of biology, chemistry, earth science, engineering,                      
              mathematics, and physics. An additional set of six 30-minute                   
              workshop tapes will contain sample student and teacher                         
              interviews and samples of both effective and ineffective                       
              teaching methods, and will be accompanied by activity books.                   
              A panel of six teachers with a background in misconception                     
              research will serve in summer workshops as an advisory group                   
              in the development of the materials.  The video tape series                    
              and workshop materials will be derived from the work pioneered                 
              in Project Star; the tapes will be an extension of the pilot                   
              video, A Private Universe.  There is a cost-sharing is 37% of                  
              the amount requested from NSF.
