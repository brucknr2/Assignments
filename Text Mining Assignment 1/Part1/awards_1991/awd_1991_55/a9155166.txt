Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This project, sponsored by the University of Wisconsin-La                      
              Crosse, will provide a four-year masters program specifically                  
              tailored for high school Chemistry teachers in the state of                    
              Wisconsin.  The program consists of a prerequisite year                        
              offering calculus and Physics, followed by the major topics                    
              in chemistry (Analytical Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry,                       
              Organic Chemistry, Biochemistry and Physical Chemistry)                        
              integrated with STS topics and safety issues.  Pedagogy                        
              issues, and laboratory and demonstration techniques are also                   
              totally integrated into the program.  In addition to the                       
              content and pedagogy the project has a strong leadership                       
              component which involves key administrators from the schools                   
              where the teachers are employed.                                               
                                                                                             
              The matching funds from the University, the school districts                   
              and business and industry constitute a match of about 22% of                   
              the NSF grant.
