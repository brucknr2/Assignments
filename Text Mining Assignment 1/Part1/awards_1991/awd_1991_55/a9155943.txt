Abstract    :
              Project GeoSim is a multidisciplinary effort involving members                 
              of the Departments of Geography and Computer Science, College                  
              of Education, and Learning Resources Center at Virginia Tech to                
              develop Computer-Aided Education (CAE) software for the                        
              teaching of introductory geography. Project GeoSim will                        
              incorporate the immense capabilities of Geographic Information                 
              Systems (GIS) and simulation. Our CAE materials will be usable                 
              by a wide range of students, focusing in particular on                         
              introductory undergraduate students. Thus, the most exciting                   
              aspects of geography are made available to the widest audience,                
              and in a manner that stresses dynamic processes over static                    
              information. Initially we will provide a series of two                         
              computerized laboratory modules applicable to virtually all                    
              introductory geography courses. These modules must meet several                
              criteria such as being highly interactive, appropriate for                     
              computer novices, incorporating a GIS and simulation when                      
              appropriate, and able to run on a wide range of moderately                     
              priced equipment.
