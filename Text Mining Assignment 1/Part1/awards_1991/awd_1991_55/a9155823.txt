Abstract    :
              An Introductory Physics Laboratory Course at Rutgers-Newark is                 
              being developed using micro computer based instrumentation to                  
              improve the understanding and appreciation of the laws of                      
              physics and of the instrumentation and methods of modern                       
              physics and technology.  The makeup of the Rutgers-Newark                      
              student body and the geography and demographics of the Newark                  
              area, coupled with significant outreach efforts, ensures a                     
              large minority student participation in this project.  Teaching                
              and teaming strategies geared to the needs of this diverse                     
              urban student population are being developed. Said strategies                  
              utilize non-intimidating but rigorous discovery based                          
              experiments and provide a meaningful and accurate introduction                 
              to the excitement and creativity of scientific discovery and                   
              analysis.  The course uses modern sensors for motion, force,                   
              temperature, sound and electromagnetic field measurements.  The                
              sensors are being interfaced to Macintosh microcomputers                       
              allowing the students to analyze their measurements rapidly and                
              to explore alternative physical hypotheses. The project attract                
              more students into physics and engineering, and produces better                
              educated students with critical analytical skills in all                       
              majors.  The program is being adapted, for and shared with high                
              school teachers and their students as well as two-year college                 
              faculty and students.
