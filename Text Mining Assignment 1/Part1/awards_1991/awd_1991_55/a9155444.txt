Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Oregon Graduate Institute of Science & Technology seeks                    
              support for an expansion of the Apprenticeships in Science and                 
              Engineering (ASE) launched in 1991 by its Saturday Academy                     
              with the placement of 80 students.  Among the project's goals                  
              are increasing the opportunities for Hispanic and Native                       
              American students and integration of applied experiences from                  
              the field into the curriculum.  Over the four-year period of                   
              the project, an additional 75 students and 5 teacher-monitors                  
              will be involved with the program each year, for a total of                    
              300 additional students and 20 additional teachers.  Plans for                 
              continuation after the period of NSF funding are likely to be                  
              realized.  The partnership will bear approximately 67% of the                  
              total project costs.
