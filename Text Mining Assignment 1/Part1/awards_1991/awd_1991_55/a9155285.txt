Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Franklin Institute Science Museum in Philadelphia, PA, in                  
              collaboration with the Girl Scouts of the United States of                     
              America, the largest voluntary organization for girls in the                   
              world, requests NSF support for the National Science Partnership               
              for Girl Scout Councils and Science Museums.  This three-year                  
              project establishes partnerships between seven Girl Scout                      
              councils and six science-technology museums in six regions                     
              across the nation to promote science interest and knowledge in                 
              young American women.  The project provides hands-on science                   
              activity kits and training workshops for Girl Scout leaders that               
              assist them in conducting science activities with their troops.                
              The science activities are directly linked to the existing Girl                
              Scout badge program and help Brownie and Junior Girl Scouts                    
              (ages 8-11) fulfill science-related badge requirements.  Each                  
              council/museum partnership will develop a specific program that                
              involves the local underserved populations in Girl Scout science               
              activities.  during the three years of federal support, the                    
              National Science Partnership will develop a specific program                   
              that involves the local underserved populations in Girl Scout                  
              science activities.  During the three years of federal support,                
              the National Science Partnership will directly serve 11,500                    
              leaders and 138,000 Girl Scouts.  Extensive project                            
              dissemination will encourage the involvement of new partnerships               
              and the institutionalization of the National Science Partnership               
              by GSUSA, councils, science museums, and other formal education                
              organizations so that the project has the potential to reach the               
              more than 2.3 million Girl Scouts and 780,000 leaders across the               
              United States.
