Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Brooklyn Campus of Long Island University will initiate a six-             
              week, commuter Young Scholars project in Molecular Biology for 16              
              students entering grades 10-12.                                                
                                                                                             
              The program will emphasize student participation in the basic                  
              techniques in molecular biology including isolation of DNA, DNA                
              cloning, restriction enzyme analysis, Southern blotting,                       
              hybridization, expression screens, etc.  Experiments will be                   
              supplemented with lectures about the methodology employed, data                
              analysis, and selected topics in molecular biology (i.e., structure            
              of macromolecules, gene regulation, etc.).  Participants will                  
              utilize the knowledge they have gained to perform an independent               
              research project during the final 2-3 weeks of the program.
