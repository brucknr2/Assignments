Abstract    :
              This project undertakes a systematic restructuring of how                      
              introductory digital logic design is taught.  The same                         
              computer-based tools used to carry out logic design by                         
              practicing engineers is brought to bear on the learning                        
              process.  The use of workstations in the classroom and by                      
              students for simulation, computation and optimization is                       
              emphasized.  The restructuring effort will begin with two                      
              short-term objectives:  to develop new homework problems and                   
              other learning activities which make use of logic simulation                   
              software, and to provide student access to a multimedia                        
              electronic knowledgebase dealing with digital logic design.                    
              The homework problems developed and a videotape describing the                 
              multimedia knowledgebase will be made available to other                       
              academic institutions for the cost of duplication.  Results                    
              will be disseminated at the Frontiers in Education conference.
