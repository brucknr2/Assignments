Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Dr. Martin Marin is the Dean of the School of Education at                     
              City University of New York, and he has designed an                            
              innovative program for introducing atmospheric science and                     
              weather-prediction technology into the elementary and middle                   
              school curriculum in Community School Districts 5, 10, 11,                     
              and 25 of New York City.  The City's instructional program                     
              for grades 5 and 8 already includes weather as a content                       
              topic, and Dr. Marin's project will significantly enhance                      
              the teaching and learning of this subject.  Dr. Marin has                      
              established close ties among the University's department of                    
              Atmospheric Sciences and the national network of                               
              satellite-derived weather data.  A cadre of 12 science                         
              teachers from the four districts will receive two weeks of                     
              intensive training in atmospheric sciences, satellite                          
              weather data, computer-based telecommunications and analysis                   
              of weather data.  The teachers and atmospheric scientists                      
              will spend a year designing instructional strategies for                       
              classroom use and a curriculum for training teachers in the                    
              content and delivery of inquiry-driven weather units.                          
                                                                                             
              Weather is a content topic that lends itself well to urban                     
              school districts.  With the right instructional strategies,                    
              weather can be a springboard to teaching inquiry skills,                       
              data analysis, computer applications, and a wide variety of                    
              problem-solving strategies.  The proposed planning effort                      
              has the potential for wide impact on the New York City                         
              science curriculum, and on instructional programs in many                      
              other large cities.
