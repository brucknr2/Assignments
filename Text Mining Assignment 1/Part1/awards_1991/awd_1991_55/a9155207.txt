Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                            
              This proposal is a cooperative effort between the Educational                  
              Service District                                                               
              (USGS) to develop a science teacher education program that                     
              incorporates components of a successful prior NSF program that                 
              addressed Mt. St. Helens.  The project, over a span of three                   
              years, plans to provide instructional strategies to 120                        
              teachers of grades five through nine using a peer coaching and                 
              trainer-of trainers model.  Teams will study the related                       
              physical and life sciences of the Columbia River Gorge, the                    
              Columbia River, the Willamette Valley, and the Pacific Ocean.
