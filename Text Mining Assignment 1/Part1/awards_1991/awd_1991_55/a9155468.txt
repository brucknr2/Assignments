Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Irvine Unified School District (California), in                            
              partnership with McDonnell Douglas Corporation, has proposed                   
              a project to improve the science literacy of youth in grades                   
              4 - 8 through activities to increase the amount of science in                  
              the curriculum, integrating applications of science into other                 
              courses and areas of study, and involving in particular female                 
              students.  Activities include, inter alia::  (1) after-school                  
              "Science Little League;" (2) Saturday morning tours and                        
              lectures; (3) in-house tours; (4) guest speakers; (5)                          
              development of hands-on lessons; (6) a Cable TV show; (7)                      
              development of a Project Dissemination Handbook.                               
              The partnership is shouldering 51% of the anticipated costs of                 
              the project.
