Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Mathematics  can be exciting.  It can be fun.  The modern                      
              world surrounds us with examples of its beauty.  Too often,                    
              however, these examples go unnoticed or unexplored.  This is                   
              one reason so few young Americans think of mathematics as a                    
              potential career path:  they do not realize how much                           
              mathematics is a part of their lives, or how much they use                     
              it -- often without knowing it|  The Maryland Science Center                   
              and the mathematics faculty of the George Washington                           
              University have teamed up to create The Language of                            
              Patterns, a mathematics exhibit that examines mathematics in                   
              modern life.  Through engaging interactive exhibit stations,                   
              The Language of Patterns invites visitors of all ages to                       
              discover the intricacy and wonder of modern mathematics.                       
                                                                                             
              Eschewing highly technical terminology, the exhibit focuses                    
              instead on fun and exploration.  Mounted by the Maryland                       
              Science Center in its Baltimore facility and in a traveling                    
              version that will be available to science and technology                       
              museums across the county, this exhibit represents a unique                    
              collaboration between academic and museum exhibition design                    
              experts.  More important, The Language of Patterns is an                       
              opportunity for visitors to rethink their relationship with                    
              modern mathematics, one of man's most significant -- and                       
              misunderstood -- achievements.
