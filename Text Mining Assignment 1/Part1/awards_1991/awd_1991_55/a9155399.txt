Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This three year project, sponsored by the Council for Basic                    
              Education, will provide each year 100 summer fellowships                       
              for outstanding middle school and high school teachers                         
              (Grades 6-12).  The Fellows will carry-out individual                          
              summer research projects under the supervision of mentors                      
              from colleges and universities chosen by the Fellows.  The                     
              topics chosen must relate to the interconnectedness between                    
              the sciences and the humanities.  The Fellow, after the                        
              summer study is over, will prepare a report on the summer                      
              activities and will work with a colleague in humanities to                     
              apply the results of the study in an appropriate way to the                    
              school curriculum.                                                             
                                                                                             
              The Council for Basic Education is providing matching funds                    
              in the amount equivalent to 106% of the NSF grant.
