Abstract    :
              A new course titled Consequences of a Chemical World is being                  
              offered to both science and non-science majors in their                        
              freshman year in the university.  Novel and innovative aspects                 
              of this course include an assumption that a course on chemicals                
              in the environment does not depend on a pre-existing base of                   
              chemical facts, and is best introduced at the start of a                       
              university curriculum, a belief that laboratories associated                   
              with the course should be completed outside of the university                  
              itself, in the arenas in which the real business of                            
              environmental assessment, monitoring, and regulation is                        
              achieved, that continued involvement of the students in                        
              environmental issues, and magnification of the impact of the                   
              course, can be accomplished through presentations by the                       
              students of selected aspects and topics of the course to others                
              in local school and community forums. The course is divided                    
              into parts so that sub-sections, or even individual lectures                   
              and demonstrations, can be repeated in other universities, in                  
              high schools, and in community meetings.
