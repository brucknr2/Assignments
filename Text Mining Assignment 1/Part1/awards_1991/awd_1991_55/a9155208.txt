Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal is designed to provide training for 50                           
              Kindergarten teachers and assistants over a period of three                    
              years and to maximize the implementation of the new                            
              Kindergarten Science curriculum which was recently developed                   
              in the Carroll County Public School System.  This curriculum                   
              is based on a constructivist approach, and incorporates                        
              educational approaches which are suitable for young children.                  
              Teachers will be provided with the necessary content and                       
              process knowledge in science, and Kindergarten Instructional                   
              Assistants will be trained to ensure their role in                             
              successfully supporting science instruction in the classroom.                  
              A leadership team will be developed to provide support to                      
              colleague teachers and appropriate science inservice and peer                  
              coaching to new Kindergarten teachers coming into the school                   
              system.                                                                        
                                                                                             
              This project is appropriate for the Teacher Enhancement                        
              Program because of its plan to enhance in a substantive way                    
              the science teaching of all Kindergarten teachers in the                       
              Carroll County MD public school system, and because of its on-                 
              going plan to provide inservice to new Kindergarten teachers                   
              coming into the system.                                                        
                                                                                             
              Non-NSF cost-sharing is approximately 66% of the amount                        
              requested from NSF.
