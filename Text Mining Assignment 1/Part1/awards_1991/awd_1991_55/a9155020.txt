Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The University of Chicago will initiate a four-week, commuter Young            
              Scholars project in Mathematics, Physics and Computer Science which            
              will offer science enrichment activities for 105 precollege                    
              students entering grades 7-12.                                                 
                                                                                             
              This program will emphasize research participation in mathematics.             
              The mathematical focus will be on number theory, with the content              
              and sophistication varying according to the grade level of the                 
              participants.  At the high school level there will be additional               
              work in chaos and computers at the 9-10 grade level; probability               
              and statistics will be added at the 11-12 grade level.  Students               
              will be provided with a rich and diverse experience in mathematics,            
              physics and computer science.
