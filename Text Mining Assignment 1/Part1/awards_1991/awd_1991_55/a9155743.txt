Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              TERC, in collaboration with three states and others, will                      
              create and implement the first phase of the development of                     
              server and client software that provides the functionality                     
              needed to make the National Research and Education Network                     
              meet the needs of precollege educators.  The long-range goal                   
              is to facilitate the kind of network-based student and                         
              teacher collaboration which supports the reform needed in                      
              mathematics and science education.  This will be achieved by                   
              simplifying access to NREN and providing software                              
              functionality that supports collaboration on the computers                     
              typically used in schools for telecomputing.  Issues of                        
              technical and administrative infrastructure building, of                       
              marketing of educational services, and of controlling                          
              student use of NREN resources will also be addressed.                          
                                                                                             
              In this phase of the work, TERC will work closely with                         
              teachers, mid-level networks, potential educational service                    
              providers, telecommunications experts, and its state                           
              partners to assess educational needs, technical resources,                     
              and software standards.  A minimal set of the resulting                        
              specifications will be implemented, disseminated to                            
              participating states and other institutions, incorporated in                   
              TERC telecomputing-based projects, and evaluated.
