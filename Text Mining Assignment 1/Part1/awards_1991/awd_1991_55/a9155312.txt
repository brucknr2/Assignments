Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              Ms. Phyllis Brady is the Director of the Child Development                     
              Programs in the Education Office of Santa Barbara County,                      
              California.  Ms. Brady proposes three years of leadership                      
              training in science and math education for 90 elementary and                   
              pre-school teachers from Santa Barbara, Ventura, and San                       
              Luis Obispo Counties.  The teachers would be drawn from                        
              schools with large minority enrollments, and the training                      
              would focus on modifying existing instructional materials,                     
              and developing new materials, that address the                                 
              multicultural, socioeconomic, physical disability, and                         
              gender equity issues.                                                          
                                                                                             
              The proposed workshops will provide the participating                          
              teachers with an excellent background and experience in                        
              science and math content, and the most current teaching                        
              methods in early childhood science/math education.  This                       
              training experience will allow them to develop strategies                      
              for improving equity of access to science and mathematics                      
              for children of diverse backgrounds.  They will then train                     
              and work with the other teachers in their respective schools                   
              to extend the impact of their training.                                        
                                                                                             
              The cost sharing for this project (not including substitute                    
              release days for participating teachers provided by their                      
              school districts) represents 17% of the NSF contribution.
