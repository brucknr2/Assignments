Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This program offers a three year sequence of four-week summer                  
              institutes in Biology, together with dissemination and outreach                
              activities, as part of the Woodrow Wilson National Science and                 
              Mathematics Leadership Program. The four-week institutes, which                
              begin in the summer of 1992, are held on the campus of Princeton               
              University. The 1992 institute is devoted to the topic area of                 
              bioethics, the 1993 institute to a comprehensive view of                       
              traditional and contemporary biotechnology, and the 1994                       
              institute to middle school biology.                                            
                                                                                             
              The four-week institutes include lectures, laboratory activities,              
              modeling of teaching methods designed to involve students in                   
              their learning, extensive use of computer technology, and both                 
              small group and individual projects. In the follow-up and                      
              outreach activities, materials written by the participants are                 
              field-tested in their own classrooms and reproduced for                        
              distribution to peers. Further dissemination occurs through one-               
              week workshops conducted in subsequent years by teams of lead                  
              teachers selected from institute participants. Continuing                      
              contacts among the participants and the growing number of other                
              classroom teachers included through the outreach projects are                  
              encouraged through a telecommunication network.
