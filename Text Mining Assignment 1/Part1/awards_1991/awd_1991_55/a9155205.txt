Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This three year project, sponsored by The University of                        
              Chicago, will offer teachers each summer courses in ecology                    
              and earth science.  Each course will enroll 25 teachers.  The                  
              ecology course emphasizes the study of natural history based                   
              upon the concepts of population biology and environmental                      
              adaptation.  The teachers will learn how to use visual media                   
              and Chicago's science resources (The Field Museum, the Shedd                   
              Aquarium and the Lincoln Park Zoo) to help their students                      
              understand basic principle of ecology.  The earth science                      
              course is structured around the geology of nearby important                    
              geological sites.  The teachers will learn the key geological                  
              principles illustrated by each locale.  From this experience                   
              they will be able to conduct field trips with their students                   
              and provide them with tangible examples of geologic processes.                 
              In addition to the summer programs, there will be follow up                    
              activities during the academic year, which include a series of                 
              on-campus Saturday seminars as well as classroom visits.  The                  
              matching funds from the University and the Chicago School                      
              District amount to 13% of the NSF grant.
