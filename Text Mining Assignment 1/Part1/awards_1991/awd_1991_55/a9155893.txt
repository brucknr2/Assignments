Abstract    :
              Large enrollment introductory science courses often share                      
              several structural and procedural problems, such as lectures                   
              that survey topics found in encyclopedic biology textbooks, a                  
              tradition of "covering" an ever-expanding body of knowledge, an                
              emphasis on memorization and passive learning, and computer                    
              assisted learning that provides little more than drill                         
              instruction in taking multiple-choice examinations.  The                       
              objectives of this project are to: 1) increase active learning                 
              through wide-spread use of informal writing projects in                        
              recitation, lecture, and lab, with students writing sample exam                
              questions, article summaries, or concept definitions, 2)                       
              upgrade the course's computer facility to accommodate word                     
              processing and networked conversational software, so as to                     
              encourage creativity, and support collaborative learning, and                  
              3) relate biological principles to relevant social and                         
              political contexts through specific reading/discussion/writing                 
              assignments.  Graduate teaching assistants are trained to lead                 
              discussions and organize students into collaborative                           
              writing/learning projects, and advanced undergraduate majors                   
              are employed in the course's computer center as peer tutors and                
              leaders of computer-assisted collaborative writing and                         
              learning.  The effectiveness of this effort in enhancing                       
              learning by students at this urban university, which enrolls a                 
              large number of women and minorities, will be evaluated, and                   
              the results disseminated to other institutions in the region                   
              and nationally.
