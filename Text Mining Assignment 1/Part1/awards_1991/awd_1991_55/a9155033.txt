Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Oklahoma State University will initiate a four-week,                       
              residential Young Scholars project in Biology, Chemistry,                      
              Mathematics and Physics for 36 students entering grades 9 and 10.              
                                                                                             
              The program will consist of morning lectures in mathematics,                   
              statistics and the philosophy and ethics of science with afternoon             
              laboratory experiences in biology, chemistry and physics.                      
              Participants will be divided into three groups of twelve to rotate             
              through the afternoon laboratory sciences, and all 36 students will            
              spend the first 2 weeks of the camp attending the sessions on                  
              mathematics, statistics and philosophy.  During Week 3 the students            
              will cover career exploration and visits to various laboratories on            
              the campus of the Oklahoma State University.  Evening programs to              
              include astronomic observations as well as time to visit the                   
              library and to work on class assignments will be arranged.  In                 
              addition, a trip to the Omniplex -- a science museum and                       
              planetarium in Oklahoma City -- is planned for one of the Saturdays            
              during the project.
