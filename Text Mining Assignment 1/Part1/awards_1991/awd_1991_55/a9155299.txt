Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal describes a collaborative effort to provide                      
              instruction and on-going support in the use of introductory                    
              biotechnology classroom materials to St. Louis city and county                 
              teachers of grades 6-8.  Key components of the plan include                    
              the training of 96 lead teachers (CADRE teams) who will have                   
              extensive presentation skills for adult instruction and the                    
              use of a telecommunications network to reach an additional 200                 
              classroom teachers per year for a total of 600 over the course                 
              of the project.  These classroom teachers will meet at                         
              different sites in groups of about 20/site for instruction via                 
              telecommunication and on-site support from CADRE teams.                        
                                                                                             
              This leadership project is appropriate for the Teacher                         
              Enhancement Program because of its potential to reach a large                  
              number of classroom teachers in a very cost-effective yet                      
              substantive way, and because it is a collaborative effort of                   
              an educational consortium (MSEC), school districts,                            
              universities and local industry.                                               
                                                                                             
              Non-NSF cost-sharing is approximately 60% of the amount                        
              requested from NSF.
