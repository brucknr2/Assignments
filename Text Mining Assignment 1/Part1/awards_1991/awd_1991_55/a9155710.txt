Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                  We propose to create the Geometry Forum, which will                       
              consist of the following three elements:                                       
                                                                                             
                   o    an electronic database containing a great deal of                    
              useful information on geometry in all its aspects -- its                       
              teaching, modern research questions, information on                            
              mathematics education projects, records of student                             
              interactions and questions;                                                    
                                                                                             
                   o    a community consisting of the many satisfied users                   
              of the database (often conducting their own private                            
              electronic mail correspondence on the side): high school and                   
              college students, high school and college teachers, pure and                   
              applied research geometers, developers of materials and                        
              researchers into geometry education;                                           
                                                                                             
                   o    especially user-friendly software for creating,                      
              maintaining, and accessing the electronic database, which                      
              allows sophisticated techniques for browsing and searching,                    
              uses symbols and diagrams, and implements hypertext                            
              features.                                                                      
                                                                                             
                   In effect, we will be creating a dynamic geometry                         
              journal, together with a large and diverse group of                            
              readers/contributors.  Users will have their own                               
              personalized electronic journal, with immediate access to                      
              all previous material, and easy means of making their own                      
              contributions.                                                                 
                                                                                             
                   Our Forum will contribute both to new                                     
              telecommunications technology, and to education.  We will                      
              expand the possibilities for student learning via                              
              telecommunications, and also increase the geometry resources                   
              available to teachers (including such personal resources as                    
              support groups).  Our Forum should also make it possible for                   
              the geometry research community to become meaningfully                         
              involved with the education of school students.
