Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              This proposal provides for the enhancement of 42 teachers (21                  
              selected each year) of grades 6-12.  The project provides for                  
              14 teacher teams composed of one secondary science teacher and                 
              two middle school teachers to study the applications of basic                  
              science (theories and concepts) in selected industries and                     
              societal agencies for translation through teacher generated                    
              modules into high school and middle school classrooms.  Two                    
              senior scientists, a Professor of Biology and a Professor of                   
              Chemistry are paired experienced science teachers and a                        
              teacher educator for two, three-week summer developmental                      
              workshops and academic year seminars.  The teachers will                       
              translate the curriculum generated in the summer curriculum                    
              development activities into clinics for high school and middle                 
              school teachers in their school districts during the school                    
              year. Science teaching skills will be enhanced through:  (1)                   
              vertically integrated science teams in the school system; (2)                  
              building teacher-generated curriculum by modifying outdated                    
              curriculum materials; and (3) implementation of greater                        
              attention to basic science in the middle grades prior to high                  
              school.  Some of the concepts and themes included in the                       
              workshops are DNA, enzymes, marine biology, energy, water                      
              cycle and quality, and the relationship of chemistry to our                    
              environment and daily lives.                                                   
                                                                                             
              Cost sharing is equivalent to 45% of the NSF award.
