Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              OVERVIEW                                                                       
                                                                                             
              California State University, Fullerton, is offering a three-                   
              year Language and Mathematics Project for 64 elementary (K-5)                  
              teachers.  The project will create a partnership with Santa                    
              Ana Unified School District, which has a high enrollment of                    
              minority and Limited English Proficiency students.  One half                   
              of the participants will be drawn from Lowell Elementary, a                    
              school with one of the highest minority enrollments and lowest                 
              mathematics achievement scores in the district.  The other                     
              participants will come from other schools in the district.                     
              Participants will attend 25 four-hour sessions throughout the                  
              school year for each of two years.  They will receive in-                      
              school support between sessions by specialists funded by the                   
              grant and by the school district, as well as by peers who have                 
              been involved in previous programs in the district.  The                       
              project intends to help teachers improve their skills in                       
              mathematics and mathematics teaching and support success of                    
              ethnic minority children in mathematics through a focus on use                 
              the language of mathematics in problem solving, new content,                   
              and emphasis on higher order reasoning.                                        
                                                                                             
              California State University, Fullerton, and the Santa Ana                      
              Unified School District are contributing a 71% cost share for                  
              the project.
