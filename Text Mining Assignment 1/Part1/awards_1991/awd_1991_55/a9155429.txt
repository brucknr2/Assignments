Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              George Awad, an artisan noted for his superb architectural                     
              models turned his talent to pursue his personal fascination                    
              with science and astronomy.  The results was a preliminary                     
              prototype of a stunningly detailed and beautiful exhibit                       
              called "Model of the Universe by Powers of Ten".  A special                    
              showing of the exhibit by the Planetary Society drew rave                      
              reviews from an audience of noted scientists and science                       
              educators.  Preliminary showings at the Montshire Museum of                    
              Science and at the Smithsonian's Experimental Gallery                          
              demonstrated its unusual appeal withthe general public, and a                  
              second modified and larger version has been created by Mr.                     
              Awad.                                                                          
              Montshire Museum of Science proposes to collaborate with the                   
              Maryland Science Center and with Mr. Awad to 1) further refine                 
              the two existing prototype exhibits, 2) develop companion                      
              interpretive materials to more fully convey the astronomical                   
              and mathematical concepts implicit in the exhibits, and 3)                     
              display the two prototypes at the two collaborating museum                     
              sites and evaluate their effective with the public.  This work                 
              is intended to guide the proposed creation (not part of this                   
              proposal) of a permanent and much larger-scale "Universe"                      
              exhibit designed to be circulated among major science museums.//
