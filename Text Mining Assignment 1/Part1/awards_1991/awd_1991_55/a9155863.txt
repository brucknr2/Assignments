Abstract    :
              To address the problems of ineffective entry-level science                     
              courses and inadequate preparation for pre-college science                     
              teachers, introductory environmental science laboratory courses                
              are being developed that utilize investigative procedures and                  
              provides experiences for undergraduates interested in science                  
              education.  In the investigative laboratory students work                      
              collaboratively in groups of 8-10 to identify a research                       
              question, develop and carry out the protocol necessary to                      
              answer the question, analyze and interpret the data, and                       
              communicate their results both orally and in writing to a                      
              general audience. Each group is led by a student from the                      
              upper-level science education course, who also receives                        
              instruction on teaching science methodology, leadership skills,                
              and strategies to stimulate enthusiasm for scientific inquiry.                 
              The goals of this project are to 1) introduce the excitement of                
              scientific inquiry in an entry-level science course, 2) develop                
              a model to integrate entry-level science courses with upper-                   
              level courses on science education, and 3) better prepare                      
              precollege teachers to teach the methods of scientific inquiry.
