Abstract    :
                                                                                             
              The Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium (LUMCON) will initiate            
              a six-week, commuter and residential Young Scholars project in the             
              Marine Sciences for 10 students entering grade 12.                             
                                                                                             
              During the first 2 weeks of the summer activity, participants will             
              be provided with a daily lecture on Marine Science and a hands-on              
              laboratory or field trip.  Lectures, labs and field trips will be              
              conducted by LUMCON faculty and invited faculty from Louisiana                 
              universities having marine science programs.  During Week 3, all               
              students will participate in a three-day/two-night cruise aboard               
              the R/V Pelican to the Mississippi delta region of the Gulf of                 
              Mexico.  At the end of this three-week familiarization experience,             
              each student will be matched with a mentor for a research                      
              experience of variable length and type, to take place sometime                 
              later in the summer.  The objective is to provide participants an              
              opportunity for deeper involvement in an active research program --            
              not to give the students independent projects.
